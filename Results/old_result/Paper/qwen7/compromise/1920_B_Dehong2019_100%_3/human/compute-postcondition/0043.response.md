Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < x`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `x` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ans1` is not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`, but its value is dependent on the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we do not change `ans1` based on the loop itself.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be the same as before, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`**. 

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we keep it as a condition rather than a specific number. Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be the same as before, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`**.
