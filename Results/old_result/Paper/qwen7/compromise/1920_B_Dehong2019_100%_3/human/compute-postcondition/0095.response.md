Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `i < k`.

3. **Analyze the given states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + x`
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `ans1` is the initial sum of all elements in list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements in list `a` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`
   - `ans2` is the maximum value between its original value and `ans1`
   - `t` is decreased by `x * k`
   - `ans2` remains equal to `ans1`
   - `i + x` is less than `n`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is `i + x` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + x + 1` (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - `k` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition does not depend on `i` directly but rather on `i < k`.
   - `ans1` and `ans2` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`, but since the question asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to explicitly state the values of `ans1` and `ans2` unless they change in a way that affects other variables.
   - `t` is decreased by `x * k` at the end of the previous iteration, so for the next iteration, `t` will be `t - x * k - x * k = t - 2 * x * k`.
   - `i + x` must be less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, so for the next iteration, `i + x + 1` must be less than `n`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` becomes `i + x + 1`
   - `k` remains the same
   - `t` becomes `t - 2 * x * k`
   - `i + x` must be less than `n` for the next iteration

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by `2 * x * k`, `i + x` must be less than `n`**
