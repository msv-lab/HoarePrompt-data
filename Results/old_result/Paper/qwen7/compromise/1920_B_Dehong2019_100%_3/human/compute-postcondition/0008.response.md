Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(x)`. This means that the variable `i` is being iterated over a range from 0 to `x-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body modifies `ans1` by decreasing it by `a[i] * 2`. This means that `ans1` is being updated in each iteration based on the value of `a[i]`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans1` is decreased by `a[i] * 2`.
   - `i` is the current index of the loop, which was incremented in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `x`.

Given that `ans1` is modified in each iteration, we need to determine its new value. However, the exact value of `ans1` after the previous iteration is not provided. We know that `ans1` was decreased by `a[i] * 2` in the previous iteration, but we don't have the initial value or the exact sequence of `a[i]`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust these.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `x` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Since we don't have the exact value of `ans1` after the previous iteration, we can only provide the adjustments for `i` and `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans1` is decreased by `a[i] * 2`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `x` must be greater than `previous_i + 1`**.

Note: Replace `previous_i` with the actual value of `i` from the previous iteration if known.
