Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `ans1` and `ans2` remain as the sum of all elements in list `a` from index `x` to index `n-1` (inclusive), with the elements from index `x + 2 * k` to `n-1` being counted only once (each counted twice in the first iteration and subtracted once in subsequent iterations); `ans2` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` after all iterations; `k` remains unchanged; `t` is decreased by `x * k`; and the list `a` and the input integer `n` remain as they were initially.**
