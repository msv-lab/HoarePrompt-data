Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `a[previous_i + 1] * 2`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `x` must be greater than `previous_i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` decreases `ans1` by `a[i] * 2`. Given that `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `ans1` is now decreased by `a[previous_i + 1] * 2`. The value of `i` is updated to `previous_i + 1`, and the condition for `x` remains that it must be greater than `previous_i + 1`.
