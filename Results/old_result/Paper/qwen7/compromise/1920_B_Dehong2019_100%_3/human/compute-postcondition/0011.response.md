Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `a[previous_i + 2] * 2`, `i` is `previous_i + 2`, `x` must be greater than `previous_i + 2`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans1` by subtracting `a[i] * 2` from it. Given that `i` was previously `previous_i + 2`, now `i` remains `previous_i + 2`. The value of `x` must still be greater than `previous_i + 2`, which is now `i - 1`. The value of `ans1` is decreased by `a[previous_i + 2] * 2`.
