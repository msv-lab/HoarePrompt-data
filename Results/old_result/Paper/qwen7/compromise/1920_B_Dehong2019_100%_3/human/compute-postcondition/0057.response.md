Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, where `i` is `x`, and `x` must be less than `k`. If the condition `i + x < n` holds true, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`. If the condition does not hold, the value of `ans1` remains unchanged; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans2` to be the maximum of its current value and `ans1`. The values of `ans1`, `a`, `i`, `x`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The conditions that determine the value of `ans1` are also preserved.
