Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `x`; `ans1` is the initial value of `ans1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`; `k` remains the same; `t` is decreased by `x`; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, where `i` is `x`, and `x` must be less than `k`. If the condition `i + x < n` holds true, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`. If the condition does not hold, the value of `ans1` remains unchanged; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans1` is the value after subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from the previous iteration's value, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` must be less than `k`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` is the value after adding `a[i]` to the previous value of `ans1`, `i` is `x + 2`, `x` must be less than `k - 2`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
