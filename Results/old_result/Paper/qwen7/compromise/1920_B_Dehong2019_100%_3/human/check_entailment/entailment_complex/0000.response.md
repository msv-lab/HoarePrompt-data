Reasoning:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function correctly initializes by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and then the list `a`.
2. **Sorting and Initial Sum Calculation**: The list `a` is sorted in descending order, which is correct for the strategy of maximizing the sum for Alice and minimizing it for Bob.
3. **Initial Sum Calculation (`ans1`)**: The initial sum of the array (`ans1`) is calculated correctly. This sum is then adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements. This adjustment accounts for Bob's optimal move of flipping up to `x` elements to negative.
4. **Optimal Strategy for Alice and Bob**: The function iterates through the list `a` to consider different scenarios where Alice removes elements and Bob flips elements. Specifically, it considers the effect of Alice removing the smallest elements and Bob flipping the largest elements. This is a correct approach to handle the optimal moves for both players.
5. **Updating Maximum Sum (`ans2`)**: The function updates `ans2` to be the maximum of its current value and the new `ans1` after considering the removal and flipping operations. This ensures that `ans2` holds the best possible sum after both players make their optimal moves.
6. **Output**: The function correctly prints the maximum sum after processing all test cases.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after both Alice and Bob make their moves.

Correctness: **True**
