Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
    
    10 6 4
    
    1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
    
    2 2 1
    
    4 3
    
    2 1 2
    
    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. Additionally, there is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each i. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is 0, `ans1` is the initial sum of all elements in list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements in list `a` plus the sum of the elements from index `i - x` to `i - 1` in the list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum value between its original value and the final `ans1`, `t` is decreased by `k * x * k` (which is 0), and the list `a` and the input integer `n` remain as they were initially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes the number of test cases \( t \), the number of elements in a list \( n \), a positive integer \( k \), and another positive integer \( x \). It also processes a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). The function calculates two values, \( ans1 \) and \( ans2 \), based on specific operations involving the list \( a \) and the integers \( k \) and \( x \). Finally, it prints the maximum value between the initial \( ans1 \) and the updated \( ans1 \) after performing the specified operations.
