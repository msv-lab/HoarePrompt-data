Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is crucial because we want to consider the largest elements first when Alice and Bob make their moves.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - `ans1` is initialized with the sum of the entire array. This represents the initial sum before any moves are made.

4. **Bob's Moves:**
   - The program iterates through the first `x` elements of the sorted array and subtracts twice the value of each element from `ans1`. This simulates Bob multiplying these elements by `-1`.

5. **Alice's Moves:**
   - The program then iterates through the first `k` elements of the sorted array and adds their values to `ans1`. This simulates Alice removing these elements.
   - If there are fewer than `k + x` elements in the array, the program checks whether adding the next element (after the `x` elements Bob modified) would increase the sum. If so, it subtracts twice the value of this element from `ans1`.

6. **Finding the Optimal Sum:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum possible sum (`ans2`) by comparing `ans1` with the previous maximum.

### Correctness Check

To ensure the program is correct, let's verify the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting in descending order ensures that the largest elements are considered first, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

2. **Bob's Moves:**
   - Multiplying the `x` largest elements by `-1` is indeed optimal for Bob to minimize the sum.

3. **Alice's Moves:**
   - Removing the `k` smallest elements is optimal for Alice to maximize the sum.
   - The additional check for the overlap between Alice's and Bob's moves ensures that the sum is maximized correctly.

4. **Optimal Sum Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates the sum by considering both Alice's and Bob's moves and keeping track of the maximum possible sum.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves.

**Correctness: True**
