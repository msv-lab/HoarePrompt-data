Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `val` and `cnt`. `val` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, and `cnt` is initialized to 0. The values of `flag`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
