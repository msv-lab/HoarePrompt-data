Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` is `False`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `val` is the first element of `arr`.
- `cnt` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`, and no initial value for `ans` is provided, we assume `ans` starts as a large value or is not yet initialized. The value of `cnt` depends on the sequence of elements in `arr`.

However, without the actual input string to generate `arr`, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt` and consequently `ans`. But we know that `ans` will be the minimum value between the initial value (which is not specified) and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.

Given this, the precise value of `ans` cannot be determined without the input string. Therefore, the output will be based on the computed `ans` value after processing the input string.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value between the initial value and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of val in arr)**
