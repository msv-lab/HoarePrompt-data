### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The given solution checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - It also calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform by comparing adjacent elements. If any two adjacent elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. This helps in determining the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles the case where the array is uniform.
   - However, the solution does not correctly identify the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition in all cases. Specifically, it only considers the first element (`val`) and does not account for other possible sequences that could make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` is flawed because it only considers the first element (`val`) and does not account for other possible sequences that could make the array non-beautiful.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The solution would incorrectly calculate the minimum number of removals as `1` (removing the second `1`), but removing the fifth element would also make the array non-beautiful with fewer removals.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The solution correctly identifies whether the array is uniform.
   - However, it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition in all cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect based on the problem description. The solution does not correctly identify the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition in all cases.

**Final: False**
