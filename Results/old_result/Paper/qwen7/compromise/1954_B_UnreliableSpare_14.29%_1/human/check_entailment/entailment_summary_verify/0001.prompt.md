You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( n \)). The function determines whether the array \( a \) is uniform (all elements are the same) or not. If the array is uniform, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements in the array and prints this value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The given solution checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - It also calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform by comparing adjacent elements. If any two adjacent elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. This helps in determining the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles the case where the array is uniform.
   - It also correctly identifies the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
   - The use of `Decimal` is unnecessary and can be removed as the problem does not require high precision arithmetic.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The solution correctly identifies whether the array is uniform.
   - It correctly calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.
   - The logic is clear and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
