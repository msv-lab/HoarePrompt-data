Reasoning:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the key points:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop. The main logic should be inside a function that is called for each test case.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Beauty**: The program incorrectly checks if the array is "beautiful" by setting `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different. However, the definition of a beautiful array requires that you can make all elements the same by the specified operation, not just that all elements are the same initially.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same element but does not correctly implement the logic to ensure the array stops being beautiful after removals.

4. **Unnecessary Imports**: The imports at the beginning of the script (`import copy, math, random, decimal`) are unnecessary and could potentially cause conflicts or slow down the program.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
