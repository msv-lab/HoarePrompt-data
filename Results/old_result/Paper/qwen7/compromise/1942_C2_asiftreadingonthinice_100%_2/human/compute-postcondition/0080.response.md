Output State: **`tmp` is an empty list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 1`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, `len(a)` must be at least 1, and the current value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially `x + y - 2`, after executing this line, `ans` becomes `x + y - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
