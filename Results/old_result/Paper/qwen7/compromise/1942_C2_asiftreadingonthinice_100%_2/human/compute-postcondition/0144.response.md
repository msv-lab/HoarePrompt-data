Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 (since `range(1, len(a))` means `i` starts from 1).
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
4. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`a`, `ans`, `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `tmp`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect whether the loop can execute.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start with `i` initialized to 1 and that the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `a`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers**.
