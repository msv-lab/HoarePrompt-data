Output State: **`tmp` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in `tmp` (if it exists), `y` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += i` increments the value of `ans` by the current value of `i`. The other variables (`tmp`, `i`, and `y`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `tmp` remains a list of integers, `i` is the next element in `tmp` (if it exists), `y` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `i`.
