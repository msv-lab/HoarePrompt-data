Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `len(a)` is greater than 1
   - `ans` is 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, or no new variable `tmp` is defined if the condition is not met.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `a`, which does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `ans` and `tmp` are not directly affected by the loop itself but depend on the values of the elements in the list `a`. These values are not modified by the loop head, so they remain the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 4
- `len(a)` is still greater than 1 (since it doesn't change)
- `ans` and `tmp` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 4, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `ans` is 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, or no new variable `tmp` is defined if the condition is not met.**
