Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(a) - 1`. Therefore, the loop can continue as long as `i < len(a)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `ans` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged.
   - `tmp` is either unchanged or contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(a)`. Since `i` is now 3, the loop will continue as long as `3 < len(a)`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `ans` can either remain unchanged or be increased by 1, but since we don't have specific information about its current value, we keep it as "either increased by 1 or remains unchanged".
   - `tmp` can either remain unchanged or contain the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, and `tmp` is either unchanged or contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`.**
