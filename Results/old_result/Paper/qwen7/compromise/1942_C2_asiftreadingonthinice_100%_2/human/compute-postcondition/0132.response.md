Output State: **`i` is the next element in `tmp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block provided, the only effect is that the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
