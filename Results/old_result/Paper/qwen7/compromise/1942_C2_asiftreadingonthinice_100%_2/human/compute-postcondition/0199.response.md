Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tmp`. The variables involved here are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `tmp`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the next element in `tmp`, and `tmp` had at least one element.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - **`tmp`**: Since `i` was the next element in `tmp`, removing `i` from `tmp` means `tmp` now contains all elements except `i`.
   - **`i`**: After the previous iteration, `i` was the next element in `tmp`. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the updated `tmp`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `tmp` must now contain all elements except the one that was just processed (i.e., `i`).
- `i` will be the next element in the updated `tmp`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`tmp` is a list of integers that does not contain the previous value of `i`, `i` is the next element in the updated `tmp`**.
