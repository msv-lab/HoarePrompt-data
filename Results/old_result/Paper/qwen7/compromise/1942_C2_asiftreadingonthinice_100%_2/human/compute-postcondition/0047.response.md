Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` is greater than 1, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it within the loop plus 1 if the condition `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2` is met, `tmp` contains all the values added to it whenever the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` was met, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` includes the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `tmp.sort()` sorts the list `tmp`. However, sorting does not change the values of the elements in `tmp`, it only changes their order. Therefore, the values of `i`, `len(a)`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain the same as before the sort operation, but now `tmp` is sorted.
