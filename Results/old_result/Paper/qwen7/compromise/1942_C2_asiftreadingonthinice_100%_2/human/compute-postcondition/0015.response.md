Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `tmp` contains the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and the difference `(a[i] - a[i - 1])` is even.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 1, this translates to appending `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` to `tmp`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
