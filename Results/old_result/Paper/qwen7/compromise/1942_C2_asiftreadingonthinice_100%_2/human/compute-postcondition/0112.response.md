Postcondition: `tmp` contains the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + k`, `ii` is `ii + n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, and `len(a)` is `n`. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even, then `tmp` will contain the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged, and `y`, `ans`, `ii`, `a`, `n`, `x`, and `len(a)` retain their original values after the loop's execution.
