Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it within the loop plus 1, `tmp` contains all the values added to it whenever the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` was met, and the value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
