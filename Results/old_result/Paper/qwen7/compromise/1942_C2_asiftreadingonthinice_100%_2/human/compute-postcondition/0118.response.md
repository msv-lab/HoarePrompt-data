Output State: **`ans` is increased by `i`, `i` is the first element of `tmp`, `y` is a value that is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += i` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `i`. The other variables `tmp` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
