Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `ans` based on specific conditions involving these integers and the distances between them. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `ans + y` and `n - 2`, ensuring `y` is reduced accordingly.**
