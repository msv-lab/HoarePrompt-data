Output State: **`tmp` is an empty list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = []` initializes `tmp` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`y`, `ans`, `ii`, `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
