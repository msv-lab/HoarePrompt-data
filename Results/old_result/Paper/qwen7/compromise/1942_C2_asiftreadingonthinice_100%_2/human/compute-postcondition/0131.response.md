Output State: **`ans` is increased by `i`; `i` is the next element in `tmp`; `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= i - 1` decreases the value of `y` by `i - 1`. The value of `i` remains the same as the next element in `tmp` from the initial state, and `ans` is increased by `i` as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes these changes.
