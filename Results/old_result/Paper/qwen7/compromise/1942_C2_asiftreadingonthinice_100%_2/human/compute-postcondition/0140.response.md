Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `ans` is the final value of `ans` after all iterations, `y` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions, `ii` is `ii_current + 1`, and `tt` is `tt_current`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The variables `ans`, `y`, `ii`, and `tt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
