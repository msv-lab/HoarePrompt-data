Output State: **`ans` is the final value of `ans` after all iterations, `y` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions, and all elements in `tmp` have been iterated over.**

Explanation: The code `ans += y` simply adds the current value of `y` to `ans`. Since the loop has already processed all elements in `tmp` and updated `ans` and `y` accordingly, the only change here is adding the final value of `y` to `ans`. The values of `tmp` and the process of iterating over its elements have already been completed, so they remain unchanged.
