Postcondition: **`tmp` is a list containing all the values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each instance where `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even but not equal to 2 during the loop's execution, `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + k`, where `k` is the total number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even but not equal to 2 during the loop's execution, `ii` is `ii + n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, and `len(a)` is `n`. Additionally, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2.**
