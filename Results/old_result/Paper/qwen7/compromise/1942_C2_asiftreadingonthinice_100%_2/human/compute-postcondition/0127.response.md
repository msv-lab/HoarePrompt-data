Output State: **`i` is the next element in `tmp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is the next element in `tmp`, and the `break` statement does not modify `i`, the value of `i` remains as the next element in `tmp`. Additionally, the `break` statement indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block.
