Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in `tmp`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will iterate over each element in `tmp`. Therefore, the state of `tmp` is crucial for determining how many times the loop will execute and what values `i` will take.

3. **Determine necessary adjustments**: Since the loop iterates over `tmp`, we need to ensure that `tmp` is properly defined and contains the correct values. 

4. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
   - `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`.
   - `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each occurrence where `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` for all `i` in the range of 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
   - If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` now includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2; `tmp` is sorted.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `tmp` is correctly populated based on the conditions mentioned.
   - The loop will iterate over `tmp`, so `tmp` should contain the appropriate values.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `tmp`, ensuring it contains the correct values as described.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tmp` must contain the appropriate values based on the conditions described**.
