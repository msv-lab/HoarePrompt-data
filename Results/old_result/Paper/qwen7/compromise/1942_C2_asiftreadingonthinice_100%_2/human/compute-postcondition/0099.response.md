Postcondition: **`tmp` is a list with an additional element which is ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2), `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `ii + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, `len(a)` must be at least 1, and `i` is 3.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, the list `tmp` will have an additional element, which is half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` (integer division), `y` remains unchanged, `ans` is still `x + y - 2`, `ii` has been incremented by 2, `a` remains a sorted list of integers, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain as the first, second, and third integer inputs respectively, and the length of `a` is at least 1, with `i` being set to 3.
