### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as inputs and checks if `k` is even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`.
   - If `k` is odd or `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value.
   - It starts with a list `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iteratively moves the last element to the front until `k` becomes zero or less.
   - The logic ensures that the Manhattan value is adjusted correctly by moving elements around.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - It prints each element of the list `l` separated by spaces.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process:
     - Calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`.
     - Checks if `n` is zero (indicating no valid permutation exists).
     - Calls `func_1` to construct the permutation.
     - Calls `func_3` to print the result.

5. **Main Program**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - Iterates through each test case, calling `func_4` for each one.

### Analysis:

- The main issue lies in how `func_1` constructs the permutation. The logic in `func_1` does not always produce a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. Specifically, the logic for moving the last element to the front is flawed and may not always achieve the desired Manhattan value.

- The example test cases show that some permutations are generated correctly, but others are not. For instance, the permutation `[3, 1, 2]` for `n=3` and `k=4` is correct, but other permutations like `[8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]` for `n=8` and `k=14` do not seem to be constructed correctly based on the provided logic.

- The logic in `func_1` does not guarantee that the Manhattan value will be exactly `k` for all cases, especially when `k` is large relative to `n`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the construction logic in `func_1`, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct permutation for all test cases. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:
**False**
