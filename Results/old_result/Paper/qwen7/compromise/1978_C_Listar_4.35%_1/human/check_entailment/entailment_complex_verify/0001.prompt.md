You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12

    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 10^12). It manipulates a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` by moving the last element to the front repeatedly until `k` becomes zero or less. If the condition `1 + i > k` is met during the iteration, the function stops early. The final state of the list `l` is returned.

        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros (0, 0)

    #The program returns n, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and k, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12 and k is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \). It then checks if \( k \) is even. If \( k \) is odd, it returns two zeros (0, 0). Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible value of \( k \) based on \( n \), and if \( k \) exceeds this maximum, it also returns two zeros (0, 0). If \( k \) is within the valid range, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

    print()
    #This is printed: ''
    return
    #The program returns an empty value since there is no value being returned in the given code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `l` representing a valid permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`. It prints "YES" followed by each element of the list `l` separated by a space. After printing, the function concludes without returning any value.

#Function 4:

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12; `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`. `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no direct parameters but uses values `n` and `k` obtained from `func_2()`. If `n` is not zero, it calls `func_1(n, k)` and then `func_3(l)`, where `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. If `n` is zero, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately. The function returns 0 under certain conditions or None otherwise.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the functions step by step.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- This function takes the input values \( n \) and \( k \).
- It checks if \( k \) is odd; if so, it returns `(0, 0)` because an even Manhattan value cannot be achieved if \( k \) is odd.
- It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \):
  - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum value is \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\).
  - If \( n \) is even, the maximum value is \(\frac{n^2}{2}\).
- It checks if this maximum value is less than \( k \); if so, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution exists.
- Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- This function aims to construct a permutation with the given \( n \) and \( k \).
- It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
- It iteratively modifies the list to achieve the required Manhattan value:
  - It starts from the end of the list and moves elements to the beginning if necessary to reduce \( k \).
  - It ensures that the Manhattan value matches \( k \).

### Analysis of `func_3`:
- This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
- It takes a list `l` as input and prints each element separated by spaces.

### Analysis of `func_4`:
- This function integrates the logic of `func_2` and `func_1`.
- It first calls `func_2` to validate the input and get \( n \) and \( k \).
- If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO" and exits.
- Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Overall Correctness:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies when no solution exists.
- The logic in `func_1` constructs a permutation that achieves the required Manhattan value.
- The functions `func_3` and `func_4` handle the output format correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
