Output State: **The program returns n, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and k, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12 and k is even.**

This means the program returns two values: `n`, an integer within the range from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive), and `k`, an even integer within the range from 0 to 10,000,000,000,000 (inclusive).
