Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12; `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`, and we call `func_3(l)` with the value returned by `func_1(n, k)` as its argument.**

Explanation: The code calls `func_3(l)`, where `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`. Since `func_1(n, k)` returns a value, let's denote it as `val`, then `func_3(val)` is called. However, the specific value of `val` is not provided, so we keep it as the return value of `func_1(n, k)`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
