Precondition: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem description indicates that the interaction involves querying indices and comparing results based on bitwise operations. The variables n, a, b, c, d, x, y, and the permutation p are implicitly involved in the interaction process but are not passed as arguments to the function.**
