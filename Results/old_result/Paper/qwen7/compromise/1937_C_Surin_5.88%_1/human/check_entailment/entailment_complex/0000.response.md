### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by interacting with the judge to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
2. **Querying Indices**:
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation \(n\).
   - It initializes \(v1\) to 0 and iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index \(i\), it queries \((p_{v1} \mid p_{v1})\) vs \((p_i \mid p_i)\). If the result is `<`, it updates \(v1\) to \(i\).
   - This step ensures that \(v1\) is set to the index with the highest single-bit OR value.
3. **Finding the Maximum XOR**:
   - It then iterates again from 1 to \(n-1\) and queries \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) vs \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\). If the result is `>`, it updates \(prev\) to \(i\).
   - This step aims to find the index \(prev\) such that the XOR with \(v1\) is maximized.
4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, it prints the indices \(prev\) and \(v1\) as the solution.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The approach correctly identifies the index \(v1\) with the highest single-bit OR value.
  - The second loop correctly identifies the index \(prev\) that maximizes the XOR with \(v1\).
  - The logic ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \(3n\).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the basic logic well and should work for all valid permutations of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \).

- **Flushing Output**:
  - The program correctly flushes the output after each query and the final answer, which is necessary to ensure proper interaction with the judge.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic and constraints specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
