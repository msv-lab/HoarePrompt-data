Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not ensure that the queries are within the limit of 3n. The program constructs queries without considering the total number of queries made, which could exceed 3n in some cases. For example, consider a scenario where `n` is large, and the program keeps asking queries without properly managing the count. This could lead to exceeding the allowed number of queries, resulting in a Wrong Answer verdict. Therefore, the program needs to include logic to ensure that the total number of queries does not exceed 3n.
