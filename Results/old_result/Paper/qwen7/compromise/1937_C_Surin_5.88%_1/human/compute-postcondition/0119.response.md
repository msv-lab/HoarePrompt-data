Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, and `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**

The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `g`. Since `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` were not affected by this assignment, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
