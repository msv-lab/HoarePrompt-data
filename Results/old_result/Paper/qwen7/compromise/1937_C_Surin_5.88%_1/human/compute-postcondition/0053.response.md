Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is an input value, and `prev` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 3, to the variable `prev`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `prev` being 2 when `r` is '>' does not affect the assignment since `prev` is explicitly set to `i` regardless of the value of `r`.
