Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is an input string, and if the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 1; otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**

The code `r = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. If the input is '>', then `prev` is set to 1; otherwise, `prev` retains its original value. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
