Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the print statement execution step by step:

1. **Variables and Objects**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - `prev` is either 1 if the current value of `r` is '>', or it remains unchanged otherwise.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.
   - Here, `{v1}` is a placeholder that needs to be replaced with a specific value. However, since `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. We will keep it as `v1` in the output.

3. **Substituting Values**:
   - `{i}` is replaced with the current value of `i`, which is 2.
   - `{prev}` is replaced with the value of `prev` as described above.

Given this information, the print statement will output a string with the following format:
- The first part is a question mark (`?`).
- Followed by the value of `v1`.
- Then the value of `i`, which is 2.
- Another instance of `v1`.
- Finally, the value of `prev`.

Since `v1` is not explicitly defined and `prev` depends on the value of `r`, we will represent it in the output as follows:

Output: **'? v1 2 v1 prev'**
