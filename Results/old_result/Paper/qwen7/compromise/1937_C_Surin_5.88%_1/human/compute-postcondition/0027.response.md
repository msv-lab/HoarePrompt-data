Output State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is an input value, `v1` must be unchanged**

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `r`. Since no specific value is provided for `v1`, it remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `v2` are also unchanged. Therefore, `r` now holds the value entered by the user, while `i` and `v2` retain their initial values of 3 and 3 respectively, and `v1` remains unchanged.
