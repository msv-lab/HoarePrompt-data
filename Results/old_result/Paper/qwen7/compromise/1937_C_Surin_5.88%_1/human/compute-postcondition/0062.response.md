Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input value, `prev` is 3 if `r` equals '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0.**

The code initializes `v1` to 0, which does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `prev`, `kp`, or `g`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
