Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is the input integer, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is `n - 1` or any value between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, depending on the user's inputs ('>') during each iteration.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will take the final value of `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The values of `n` and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `g` remains 0 since it is not updated in the provided code. Both `v1` and `v2` are set to `n - 1` at the start and are not changed within the loop. The variable `prev` retains the last value of `i` that was assigned to it, which can be any value between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, based on the user's inputs during each iteration of the loop.
