Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `r` is the input string from the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `r` equals `>` or not.**

The code `r = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `r`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be at least 3 is still valid, and `prev` retains its value based on the comparison with `r`.
