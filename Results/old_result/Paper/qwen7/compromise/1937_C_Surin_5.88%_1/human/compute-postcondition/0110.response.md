Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `r` is an input string, and `prev` remains unchanged unless `r` equals '>', in which case `prev` becomes 1.**

The code `r = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. Since no specific value was provided for the input, the variable `r` now holds the string entered by the user. The initial values of `i`, `n`, and `prev` remain unchanged unless `r` equals '>', in which case `prev` would become 1. However, since no specific input value is given, we cannot determine if `prev` has changed. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `i`, `n`, and `prev` unless `r` equals '>', in which case `prev` becomes 1.
