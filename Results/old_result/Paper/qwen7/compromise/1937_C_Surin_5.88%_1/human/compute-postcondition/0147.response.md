Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `prev = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `prev`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
