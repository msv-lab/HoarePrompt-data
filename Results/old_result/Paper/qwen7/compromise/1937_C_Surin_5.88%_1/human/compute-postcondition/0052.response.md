Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is an input value, and if the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `r = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. The initial conditions for `i`, `n`, and `prev` remain unchanged unless `r` is specifically '>' in which case `prev` would be set to 2. Since the actual input value is not specified, we keep the conditions as described.
