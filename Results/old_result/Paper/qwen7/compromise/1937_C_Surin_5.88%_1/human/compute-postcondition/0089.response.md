Output State: **i is n, n is an integer greater than 4, v2 is n, v1 is n.**

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is such that `i` will be equal to the final value of `n`, which must be greater than 4. At this point, both `v2` and `v1` will also be equal to `n`. This is because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`, setting `v2` to the current value of `i` each time, and if `r` is not '<', `v1` retains the last value of `v2`.
