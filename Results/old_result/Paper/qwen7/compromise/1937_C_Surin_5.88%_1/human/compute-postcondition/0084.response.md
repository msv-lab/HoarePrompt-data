Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4, `v2` is 5**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are assigned new values or their states altered, the initial states of the variables remain unchanged.
