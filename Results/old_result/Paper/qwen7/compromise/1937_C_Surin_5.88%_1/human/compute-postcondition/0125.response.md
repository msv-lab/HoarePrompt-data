Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, and `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**.

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `r`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
