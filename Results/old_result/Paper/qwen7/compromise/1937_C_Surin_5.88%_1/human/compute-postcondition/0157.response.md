Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `1`
   - `n` must be at least `2`
   - `r` is the input string
   - `g` is `0`
   - `v1` is `n - 1`
   - `v2` is `n - 1`
   - `prev` is `i`

4. **Consider the loop body**: Although the loop body is omitted, we know that if `r` equals `'>'`, then `prev` remains `i`. Otherwise, it would typically change based on some logic within the loop body, but since it doesn't specify, we assume it might remain unchanged or could potentially change depending on the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least `2`.
   - `r` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `g` remains `0` as it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `v1` and `v2` are both `n - 1`, so they will remain the same unless modified inside the loop body, but since they are not mentioned as being modified, they stay the same.
   - `prev` is `i` from the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `prev` will be `1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is 1**
