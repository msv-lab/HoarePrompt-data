Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `v2` is 3, `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the standard output immediately. Since no variables are modified by this operation, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
