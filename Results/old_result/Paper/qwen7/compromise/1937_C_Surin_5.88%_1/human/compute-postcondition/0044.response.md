Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is an input string, and if the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 1. If the current value of `r` is not equal to '>', no additional changes occur.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are modified or affected by this line of code, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their previous state.
