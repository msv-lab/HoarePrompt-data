Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement)
- `r` is a string (though its value is not needed for this particular print statement)
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 1
- `v2` is 2
- `prev` remains unchanged and still 0

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This will print the string `? 1 1 2 2` because `v1` is 1 and `v2` is 2.

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
