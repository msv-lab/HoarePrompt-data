Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `kp`.
   - It also contains the expression `int(input())`, which is used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state given is that the function `R` is defined as a lambda function that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer.
   - This information about `R` is not directly relevant to the loop execution but is part of the overall program context.

3. **Adjust the States for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `kp` will take on values starting from 0 up to `int(input()) - 1`.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - We need to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `kp` will be set to 0 initially and will increment in each iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `kp` is 0**
