Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `r` is an input string, and `prev` remains unchanged unless `r` equals '>', in which case `prev` becomes 1.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously written output is actually sent to the standard output device (like the console). Since no variables are modified or their values changed by this command, the initial state of the variables remains the same.
