Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly processes the input string `a` to calculate the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position.
   - It then iterates through these cumulative counts to find the optimal position `i` that satisfies the conditions:
     - At least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
     - At least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - The function correctly updates the best position `ans` when a better solution is found based on minimizing the absolute difference from `n/2`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to compute the desired position `i`.
   - The function does not modify the input string `a` and correctly processes each test case independently.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It handles multiple test cases efficiently and outputs the correct results for each case.

Given the analysis above, the provided program meets the requirements and correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
