### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several key issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the program's behavior against the requirements.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Incorrect Digit Splitting and Insertion:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly split the element into its digits and insert them back into the array. This is evident from the flawed logic inside the loop.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The loop only checks if the current element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10, but it does not actually perform the necessary operations to transform the array into a sorted one.

#### Verification of the Program's Behavior:

1. **Digit Splitting and Insertion Logic:**
   - The program attempts to split an element into its digits and insert them back into the array. However, the current implementation is incorrect. For example, if the element is 45, the program should split it into 4 and 5 and insert them back into the array, but the current logic does not achieve this.

2. **Sorting Check:**
   - The `func_1` function simply checks if the array is sorted, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The program needs to ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

#### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, the program should:
1. Apply the operation of splitting elements into digits and inserting them back into the array until no more operations can be performed.
2. After applying the operation, check if the array is sorted.

#### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Digit Splitting and Insertion:**
   - The program should use a function to split an element into its digits and insert them back into the array. For example, if the element is 45, it should split it into 4 and 5 and insert them back into the array.

2. **Transformation Check:**
   - After performing the digit splitting and insertion, the program should check if the array is sorted. If not, it should continue the process until no more operations can be performed.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - The `func_1` function should be used to check if the array is sorted after each transformation.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly points out the flaws in the provided program. The program does not correctly implement the required operations to transform the array into a sorted one. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
