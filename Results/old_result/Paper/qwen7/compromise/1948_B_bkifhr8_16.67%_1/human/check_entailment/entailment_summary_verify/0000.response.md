### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Operation Implementation**: The program attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the list. However, this implementation does not guarantee that the array will become sorted. The program simply splits the elements and inserts them, but it does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted.

2. **Sorting Check**: The program uses `func_1` to check if the array is sorted. This function only checks if the array is already sorted and does not perform any operations to make it sorted if it isn't. Therefore, even if the array is not sorted after the splitting operation, `func_1` will still return `True` if the array happens to be sorted by chance.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input: `4\n12 3 45 67`.
     - After splitting `45` and `67`, the array becomes `[12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
     - The program then calls `func_1`, which returns `True` because the array is now sorted.
   - However, this does not mean that the array will always be sorted after the operation. There are cases where the array might not be sorted even after the operation, and `func_1` will incorrectly return `True`.

4. **Lack of Correct Logic**: The program lacks the necessary logic to ensure that the array is sorted after each operation. It simply performs the splitting operation and checks if the array is sorted, which is insufficient.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the described operation and does not ensure that the array will be sorted after performing the operations.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after performing the operations.
