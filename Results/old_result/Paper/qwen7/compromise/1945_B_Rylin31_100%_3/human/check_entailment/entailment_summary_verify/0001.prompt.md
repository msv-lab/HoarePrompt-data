You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the value of \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\) and prints the result. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. This involves understanding the timing of fireworks from two different installations and their visibility period.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided function `func()` has the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` representing the frequency of launching for the first installation, the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky, respectively.
3. It then prints the value of `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Correctness Check
To determine if the program is correct, let's break down the logic:
- The expression `m // a + m // b` calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`.
- Adding `2` accounts for the possibility of fireworks being launched at the exact same time from both installations, which would add an additional pair of fireworks.

However, there is a flaw in this logic:
- The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the simultaneous launches. Specifically, it assumes that the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is simply the sum of individual launches plus 2, which is incorrect because it doesn't consider the overlap between the two sequences.

### Counterexample
Consider the example given in the problem:
- For `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`:
  - The first installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 6, 12, 18, ...
  - The second installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 7, 14, 21, ...
  - Within the first 4 minutes, only the first launch from both installations (at time 0) is visible. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 1, not 2.

### Correct Solution
The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval where fireworks from both installations coincide, and then adjusting the count accordingly.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the simultaneous launches of fireworks from both installations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
