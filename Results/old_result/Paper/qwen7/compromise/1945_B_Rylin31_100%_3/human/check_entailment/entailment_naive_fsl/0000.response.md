Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. According to the problem description, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is given by the formula `m // gcd(a, b) + 1`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

The current implementation calculates `m // a + m // b + 2`, which is incorrect. For example, consider the input `(a, b, m) = (6, 7, 4)`. The correct answer should be `2` because the greatest common divisor of `6` and `7` is `1`, and thus `4 // 1 + 1 = 5`. However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

A correct implementation would be:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print((m // gcd(a, b)) + 1)
```

This corrected version uses the greatest common divisor to accurately calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
