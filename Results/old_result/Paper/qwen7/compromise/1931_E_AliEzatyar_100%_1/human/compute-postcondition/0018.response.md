Output State: **The value of `counter` will be the total count of '0's from the last index of `num` to the first index where a non-zero digit is encountered, or until the loop completes all iterations if no non-zero digit is found.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `counter` will hold the count of '0's from the end of the `num` sequence towards the beginning, stopping either when it encounters a non-zero digit or when it has iterated through the entire sequence. If `num` consists entirely of '0's, `counter` will be equal to the length of `num`. If `num` contains at least one non-zero digit, `counter` will be the count of '0's up to but not including the first non-zero digit.
