Postcondition: `counter` is either 2, 1, or 0, depending on the conditions: if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` also equals '0', `counter` is 3; otherwise, if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` does not equal '0', `counter` is 2; if `num[len(num) - 1]` does not equal '0', `counter` remains 0. In all cases, `i` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
