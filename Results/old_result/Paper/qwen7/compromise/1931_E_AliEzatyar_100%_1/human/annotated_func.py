#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The value of `counter` will be the total count of '0's from the last index of `num` to the first index where a non-zero digit is encountered, or until the loop completes all iterations if no non-zero digit is found.
    return counter
    #The program returns the count of '0's from the last index of `num` to the first index where a non-zero digit is encountered, or the length of `num` if no non-zero digit is found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range 1 to 10^9 (inclusive). It counts the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of `num`. If `num` does not contain any trailing zeros, it returns the length of `num`.
