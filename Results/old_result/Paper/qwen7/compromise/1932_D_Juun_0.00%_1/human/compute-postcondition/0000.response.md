Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS", input is read.**

The code `input()` reads an input from the user, but it does not assign this input to any variable. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged. The input itself is stored in the input buffer but no variable is assigned to it. Hence, the only change is that the program now has an input ready to be processed in subsequent lines.
