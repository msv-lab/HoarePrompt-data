Output State: **`i` is 3; `dif` is `a[4] - a[3]`**

Explanation: The code `dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]` calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression becomes `a[4] - a[3]`. The value of `n` is not used in this calculation and remains greater than 3, while `i` is updated to 3. Therefore, `dif` is set to the value of `a[4] - a[3]`.
