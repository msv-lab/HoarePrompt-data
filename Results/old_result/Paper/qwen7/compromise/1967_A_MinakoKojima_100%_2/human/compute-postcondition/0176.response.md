Output State: **`i` is 6, `k` is not 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is ans + (-1), `n` is greater than 6.**

Explanation: The code `ans += res` adds the value of `res` to `ans`. Given that `res` is -1, `ans` is updated to `ans + (-1)`, which means `ans` is decreased by 1. The values of `i`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `res` remains -1.
