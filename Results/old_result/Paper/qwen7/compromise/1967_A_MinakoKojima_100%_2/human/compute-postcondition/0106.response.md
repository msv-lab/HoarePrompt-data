Output State: **`i` is 3, `dif` is not 0, `res` is -1, `k` is `k` - `dif` * 4.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `dif` multiplied by `(i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 3, `(i + 1)` equals 4. Therefore, `k` is updated to its original value minus `dif` times 4. The values of `i`, `dif`, and `res` remain unchanged.
