Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 4, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `k` is 0, `res` is 0, `ans` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
