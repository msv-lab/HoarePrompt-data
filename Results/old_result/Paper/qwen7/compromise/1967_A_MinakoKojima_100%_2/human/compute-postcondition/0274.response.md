Output State: **`ans_list` contains the final value of `ans` for each input set processed by the loop.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans_list` will contain the cumulative result of `ans` for each input set processed. This means that if the loop ran `m` times (where `m` is the total number of input sets), `ans_list` will have `m` elements, each representing the final value of `ans` after processing the corresponding input set according to the operations defined within the loop.
