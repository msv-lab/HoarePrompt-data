Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for a in ans_list:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `a` and `ans_list`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` was an element from `ans_list`, and `ans_list` must have contained at least one element.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop will continue as long as `ans_list` contains at least one element, for the next iteration, `ans_list` must still contain at least one element. The variable `a` will be set to the next element in `ans_list`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ans_list` still contains at least one element, and `a` will be the next element in `ans_list`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is an element from `ans_list`, `ans_list` must contain at least one element**
