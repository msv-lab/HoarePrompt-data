Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is not 0, `res` is `k % n`, `ans` is `ans + res`, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `ans_list` contains `[ans]`**

Explanation: The line `ans_list.append(ans)` adds the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. Since no specific value was given for `ans` initially, it remains as `ans + res`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `res`, `dif`) remain unchanged.
