Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dif` to `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `i + 1` is 4. Since the initial state defines `dif` as `a[4] - a[3]` if `i` was 2, or `a[5] - a[4]` if `i` was 3, and since `i` is now 3, `dif` is updated to `a[5] - a[4]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
