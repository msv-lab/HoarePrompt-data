Output State: **`i` is 9, `dif` is `a[10] - a[9]`, `k` is 0, `res` is unchanged, and `ans` is unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the condition for updating `k` and `res` was not met, the values of `k`, `res`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only thing that changes is that we exit the loop or conditional block.
