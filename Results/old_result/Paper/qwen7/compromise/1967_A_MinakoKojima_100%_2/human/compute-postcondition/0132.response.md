Output State: **`i` is 4, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `k` is 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is `ans + (a[5] - a[4])`, `n` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif`. Given that `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans + (a[5] - a[4])`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `res`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
