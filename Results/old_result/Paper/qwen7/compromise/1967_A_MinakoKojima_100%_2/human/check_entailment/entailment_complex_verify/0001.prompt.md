You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will contain a list `ans_list` where each element is calculated based on the given logic within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, the variable `ans` is updated according to the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`, the value of `k`, and the size of the list `n`. After processing all elements in the input as specified by the loop, `ans_list` will contain the cumulative result of `ans` for each input set processed.
    #
    #To provide a more concrete example, let's assume we have processed `m` sets of inputs (where `m` is the total number of iterations the loop runs). For each set, the value of `ans` is updated based on the operations described in the loop, and then appended to `ans_list`. Therefore, `ans_list` will contain `m` elements, each representing the final value of `ans` for each respective input set.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State: `ans_list` is a list containing the final value of `ans` for each input set processed by the loop. Each element in `ans_list` represents the cumulative result after applying the specified operations on the input lists `a` for each set, with `k` and `n` being the key parameters influencing the final value of `ans`.
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)
        
    #State: `ans_list` contains the final value of `ans` for each input set processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the initial number of cards (`a`), the number of test cases (`t`), and the available extra cards (`k`). It sorts the list of card counts, iterates through the list to adjust `ans` based on the differences between consecutive card counts and the available extra cards. Finally, it appends each calculated `ans` to a list `ans_list` and prints the contents of `ans_list`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have `n` types of cards, with `a_i` cards of type `i`.
- We can buy up to `k` additional cards.
- The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, `k`, and the initial counts of cards `a`.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array `a` to facilitate the calculation of differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Main Logic**:
   - Initialize `ans` with the minimum value in `a` and `res` with `n - 1`.
   - Iterate through the sorted array to calculate the potential increase in the number of valid subarrays.
   - For each pair of consecutive elements, check if we can use the available `k` coins to buy more cards to make the difference between them zero.
   - Update `ans` and `k` accordingly.
   - After the loop, handle any remaining `k` coins.
4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Calculate the final answer using the formula `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`.

#### Analysis:
- The logic seems to correctly account for the number of cards needed to make subarrays of length `n` permutations.
- The sorting step helps in efficiently calculating the differences between consecutive elements.
- The main loop iterates through the sorted array and updates the count of valid subarrays based on the available coins.
- The final calculation ensures that all possible valid subarrays are counted.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic for solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program is designed to solve the problem correctly based on the provided problem description and examples.

#### Correctness:
**True**
