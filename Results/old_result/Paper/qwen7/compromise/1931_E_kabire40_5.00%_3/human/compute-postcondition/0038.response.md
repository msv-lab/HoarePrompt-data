Output State: **`x` is 3; `rev_res` is a string updated by appending the reverse of `val_in[3]` to it.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += val_in[::-1]` appends the reverse of the string `val_in[3]` to the existing string `rev_res`. Since the initial state only mentions `x` and `rev_res`, and does not provide the value of `val_in`, we can only state that `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of `val_in[3]` to its current value. The value of `x` remains unchanged.
