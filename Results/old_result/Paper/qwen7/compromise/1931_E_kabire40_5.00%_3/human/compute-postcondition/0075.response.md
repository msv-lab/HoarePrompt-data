Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings, `x` is the next string in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus `x`, and `rev_val` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` updates the value of `rev_res` by adding the string `x` to it. Since `rev_res` was previously a value (let's denote it as `prev_rev_res`), now `rev_res` becomes `prev_rev_res + x`. The other variables (`operational_list`, `x`, `x_rev`, and `rev_val`) remain unchanged.
