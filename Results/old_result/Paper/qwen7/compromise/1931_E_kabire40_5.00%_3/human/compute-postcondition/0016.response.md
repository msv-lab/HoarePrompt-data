Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least two strings; `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the string `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of the string `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x[::-1]` reverses the string `x`, `rev_val` now contains this reversed string. The other variables remain unchanged.
