Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`. If the length of `x_rev` equals the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed integer of the first element of `operational_list`.**
