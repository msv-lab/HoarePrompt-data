Output State: **`x` is 3, `rev_res` is a string updated by appending the string representation of `val_in` (which is now an integer) to it.**

Explanation: The code `val_in = int(rev_val[x])` takes the value of `rev_val` at index `x` (where `x` is 3), converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `val_in`. Since `x` remains unchanged and `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of `val_in` (now an integer), the output state reflects these changes.
