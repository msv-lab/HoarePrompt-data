Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is the sum of `rev_res` and `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the integer value of the reversed first element of `operational_list` (which is stored in `x`) to `rev_res`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
