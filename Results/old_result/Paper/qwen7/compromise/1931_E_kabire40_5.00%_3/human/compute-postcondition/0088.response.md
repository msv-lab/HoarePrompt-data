Postcondition: `rev_res` is the sum of the integer values of the reversed strings in `rev_val`, `x` is an integer, and if `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by adding the integer value of `rev_val[x]`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by adding the integer value of the reversed string at index `x` in `rev_val`.
