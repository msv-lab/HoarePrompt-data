Based on the initial state provided:

- The final value of `rev_res` is a string that alternates between the integer values of `rev_val` and their reversed forms, starting with the first element of `rev_val` and ending with its last element.
- The value of `10` is given, but it seems there might be a typo here since `10` is not a list or a variable. Assuming it's meant to be `rev_val`, let's proceed with this assumption.

Given this, the `print('Sasha')` statement will simply print the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
