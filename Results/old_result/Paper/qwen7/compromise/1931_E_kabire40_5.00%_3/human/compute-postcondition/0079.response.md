Output State: **`rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed strings from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string matches the original string, and `rev_res` is the sum of those integers.**

Explanation:
- The code sorts `rev_val`, which initially contains the reversed strings from `operational_list` that meet the condition (i.e., the length of the reversed string is equal to the length of the original string).
- `rev_val` is sorted in place, so the order of elements in `rev_val` changes to be in ascending order.
- `rev_res` remains unchanged because the sorting operation does not affect its value.
- All strings in `operational_list` have been processed, and their reversals that match the original length have been added to `rev_val` and then sorted.
