Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`, `rev_res` is `x_rev` plus `x_rev`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x` (which is `x_rev`) to `rev_res`. Since `x` is defined as `x_rev`, `rev_res` is updated to be `x_rev + x_rev`, which is `2 * x_rev`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
