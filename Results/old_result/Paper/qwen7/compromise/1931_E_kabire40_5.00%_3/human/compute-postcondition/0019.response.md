Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least three strings, `x` is the first string in the list reversed and converted to an integer, denoted as `x_rev`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer. Since `x` is the first string in `operational_list`, after executing the code, `x` is updated to `x_rev`, which is the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`. The length of `operational_list` and the other elements remain unchanged.
