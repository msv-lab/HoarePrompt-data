Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, and `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` (which is the first element of `operational_list`) and converts it to an integer. The original `operational_list` and the first element `x` remain unchanged in terms of their string nature, but `x_rev` now holds the integer value of the reversed string of `x`.
