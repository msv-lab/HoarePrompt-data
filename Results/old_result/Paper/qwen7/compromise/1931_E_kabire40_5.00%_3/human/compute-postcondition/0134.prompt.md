Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the concatenation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is even) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is odd) for each iteration from `x = 0` to `x = len(rev_val) - 1`, and `y` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`. If the length of `x_rev` equals the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed integer of the first element of `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is calculated as the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` as an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `x_rev` is doubled. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
