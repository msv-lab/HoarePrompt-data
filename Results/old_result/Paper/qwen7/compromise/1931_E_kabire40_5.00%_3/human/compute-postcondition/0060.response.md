Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` takes the string `x`, reverses it, and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, we only know that `x` is a string and `x_rev` is its reversed version converted to an integer. The operational list remains unchanged.
