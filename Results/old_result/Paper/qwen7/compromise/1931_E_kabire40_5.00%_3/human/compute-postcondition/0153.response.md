Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, `x` is `previous_x + 1`, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`.**

Explanation: The code `val_in = int(rev_val[x])` assigns the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val` to the variable `val_in`. The value of `x` is updated to `previous_x + 1`, and `y` and `rev_res` remain unchanged. The other variables and their conditions are unaffected.
