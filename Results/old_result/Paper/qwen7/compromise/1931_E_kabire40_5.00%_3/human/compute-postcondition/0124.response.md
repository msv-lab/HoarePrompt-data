Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `x` and `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `operational_list`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `operational_list`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element.
   - `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer.
   - `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`.
   - If the length of `x_rev` equals the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`.
   - Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed integer of the first element of `operational_list`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `operational_list`, after processing the first element, the next element becomes the current element.
   - Therefore, `x` will now be the second element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer.
   - `x_rev` will be the integer representation of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `operational_list` will have one less element because the first element has been processed.
   - `x` will be the second element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer.
   - `x_rev` will be the integer representation of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`.**
