### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the key points to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Segment Creation:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in the input array and stores their start and end indices along with the number itself. This is done using a loop that iterates through the array and appends segments to the `arr` list.
   - The handling of the last segment by appending `-1` to `nums` ensures that the last segment is processed correctly.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that starts within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - The logic to check the start and end of the found segment to determine if there are distinct elements within the query range is correct.
   - The handling of edge cases, such as when the segment starts exactly at `l` or ends before `r`, is appropriately managed.
   - The program correctly prints `(-1, -1)` if no such segment exists or if the segment does not contain distinct elements within the query range.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures that the program efficiently finds the relevant segment, making the overall complexity manageable even for large inputs.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all edge cases appropriately.
