You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Specifically, for each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` provided via `input()` will determine the output printed. If `tc` exceeds 5, the loop will print `l` and `r` and then skip further processing for that iteration. Otherwise, it will perform a binary search on the list `arr` and based on the results, it will either print `(-1, -1)` or a range defined by `s` and `e+1`. The final state includes all printed outputs from each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It defines a function `func_1()` which is supposed to handle the processing for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the array `nums` and initializes some variables like `s`, `e`, and `num`.
   - It creates an array `arr` where each element is a tuple `(start, end, value)` representing segments of the array with the same value.
   - It appends `-1` to `nums` to handle the last segment properly.
   - It iterates through the array to create these segments.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that starts within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - It checks the start and end of the found segment to determine if there are distinct elements within the query range.
   - Depending on the conditions, it prints the indices of the distinct elements or `-1 -1` if no such elements exist.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Segment Creation:**
   - The segment creation logic correctly identifies contiguous segments of the same value in the array.
   - This part is correct and ensures that we can efficiently check for distinct elements within any query range.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment is efficient.
   - The logic to check the start and end of the segment to determine if there are distinct elements is also correct.
   - The handling of edge cases (like when the segment starts exactly at `l` or ends before `r`) is appropriately managed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when the segment starts exactly at `l` or ends before `r` correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the segment does not contain any elements within the query range.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The program efficiently processes each test case and handles queries as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
