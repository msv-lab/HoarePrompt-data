Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` remains unchanged, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6] with an additional element `-1` at the end, `s` is equal to `n`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last element of the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each change in consecutive elements in `nums` except the last one, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code `LA = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, storing the result in the variable `LA`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and only `LA` is updated to the length of `arr` minus 1.
