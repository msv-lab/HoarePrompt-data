Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `N + 1`. 

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - `i`: This variable is used as the loop counter. It starts from 0 and goes up to `N`.
   - `N + 1`: This is the upper limit for the loop. Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will run until `i` reaches `N + 1`.

3. **Check the Given State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - The array `a` remains unchanged.
   - `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \([1, 10^6]\) with an additional element `-1` at the end.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `e` is 0.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `nums`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 0 and go up to `N + 1`.
   - `N` is derived from `n`, so `N + 1` should be `n + 1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should start from 0.
- `N + 1` should be `n + 1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`i` is 0, `N + 1` is `n + 1`**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `N + 1` is `n + 1`**
