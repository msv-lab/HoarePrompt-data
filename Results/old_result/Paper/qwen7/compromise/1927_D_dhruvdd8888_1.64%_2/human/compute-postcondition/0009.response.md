Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` remains unchanged, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6] with an additional element `-1` at the end, `s` is equal to `n`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last element of the list `nums`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the first element is `s` (which is `n`), the second element is the index `i` where `nums[i]` differs from `num`, and the third element is the value of `num` before it changes.
