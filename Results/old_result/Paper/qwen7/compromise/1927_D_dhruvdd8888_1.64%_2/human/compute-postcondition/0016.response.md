Output State: **The output state depends on the inputs provided during the loop's execution. Specifically, for each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` provided via `input()` will determine the output printed. If `tc` exceeds 5, the loop will print `l` and `r` and then skip further processing for that iteration. Otherwise, it will perform a binary search on the list `arr` and based on the results, it will either print `(-1, -1)` or a range defined by `s` and `e+1`. The final state includes all printed outputs from each iteration.**

This output state cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific inputs provided during the loop's execution.
