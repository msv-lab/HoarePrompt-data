### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Each player alternates turns.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallets.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If both players play optimally, the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by mirroring Alice's moves (i.e., swapping when Alice doesn't swap, and vice versa). This ensures that Bob will be the last to make a move.
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can mirror Bob's moves similarly, ensuring she will be the last to make a move.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly checks the parity of `a + b`.
   - If `a + b` is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If `a + b` is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - Before calling `func_2()`, the program expects input for the number of test cases `t`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
  - If `a + b` is even, it returns 'Bob'.
  - If `a + b` is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b`, and calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
  - It stores the results in a list `results` and then prints each result.

### Validation Against the Original Assessment:

- **Function `func_1`**: 
  - The logic is correct. It accurately determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
  
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The logic is correct. It correctly processes each test case and prints the results as expected.

- **Overall Program Behavior**:
  - The program correctly reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results based on the parity of `a + b`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is designed to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The provided code accurately implements this logic and handles the input and output as specified.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
