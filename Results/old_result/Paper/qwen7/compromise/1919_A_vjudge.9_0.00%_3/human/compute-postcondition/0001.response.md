Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive); `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `t` is still an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `results` is an empty list.
