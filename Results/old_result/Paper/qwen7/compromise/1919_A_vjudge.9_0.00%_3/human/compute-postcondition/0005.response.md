Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for result in results:`. The only object being iterated over here is `result`, which comes from the list `results`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `results`. For each iteration, `result` will take the value of one of the elements in `results`.

3. **Determine the initial state requirements**: Since the loop will iterate over each element in `results`, the list `results` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The state before the loop starts should reflect that `results` contains at least one element. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to specify the exact value of `result` initially; we just need to ensure that `results` is non-empty.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `results` is a non-empty list.

**State:**
**`results` is a non-empty list**
