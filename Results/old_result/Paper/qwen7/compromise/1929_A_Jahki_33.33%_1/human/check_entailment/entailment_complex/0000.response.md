Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the beauty is 0 because no difference \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) will be negative.
   - If the array is not sorted, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It increments `order` each time an element is greater than or equal to its successor.
   - If `order` is 0, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the beauty is 0, which is correctly handled.
   - If the array is not sorted, sorting the array and calculating the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements is the correct approach to maximize the beauty.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
