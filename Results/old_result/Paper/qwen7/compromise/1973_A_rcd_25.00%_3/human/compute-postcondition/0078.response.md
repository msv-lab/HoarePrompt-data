Output State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high`.**

Explanation: The given code does not change the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `cur`, `low`, or `high`. It only reassigns `low` and `high` using the same expressions they had before. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `cur`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged from their initial states.
