Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `k-1`: This means `t` is set to the value of `k-1`.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers. Their specific values are not provided, so we'll keep them as `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`: This calculates the minimum difference between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`: This calculates the maximum difference between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is `cur + 1`: This implies that `cur` is incremented by 1, but since `cur` was not initialized, let's assume it starts from 0 initially. Therefore, after this operation, `cur` becomes 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be printed is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.
   - Substituting the value of `cur` (which is now 1), the expression inside the print statement becomes `p1 - 1 + p3`.

Given these steps, the expression simplifies to `p1 + p3 - 1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `p1 + p3 - 1`.

Output: **p1 + p3 - 1**
