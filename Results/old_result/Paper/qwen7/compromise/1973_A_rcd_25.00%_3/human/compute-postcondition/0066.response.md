Output State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or if statement has been exited. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and the condition related to `cur` remain unchanged.
