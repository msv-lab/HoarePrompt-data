Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`**.

This means that after executing the code, the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` retain their initial conditions, and two new variables `low` and `high` have been defined. `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, while `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
