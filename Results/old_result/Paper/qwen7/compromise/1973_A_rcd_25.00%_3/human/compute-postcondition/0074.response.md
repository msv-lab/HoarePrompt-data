Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `k-2`
- `p1` is an input integer
- `p2` is an input integer
- `p3` is an input integer
- `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
- `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
- `cur` is `high` if `p3 < p1 + p2`, otherwise `cur` remains as `high`.

The `print(-1)` statement will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
