The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This changes the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to the input integers. The values of `t`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment. The value of `cur` depends on the condition `if p3 < p1 + p2`, but since the input values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `cur` without knowing these inputs.

Output State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high` if `p3 < p1 + p2`, otherwise `cur` remains as `high`.**
