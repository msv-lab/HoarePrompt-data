Output State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is `low + 1`, and `(p1 - (low + 1) > p2 - ((p3 - (low + 1)))`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1, so `cur` changes from `low` to `low + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
