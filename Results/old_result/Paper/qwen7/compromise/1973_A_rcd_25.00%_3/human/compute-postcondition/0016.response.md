Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `cur`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `high >= cur`.

3. **Current state of `cur`**: According to the given information, `cur` is equal to `low`.

4. **Current state of `high`**: The current state of `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.

5. **Condition analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - Since `cur = low`, the condition becomes `high >= low`.

6. **Adjusting the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `high >= low` holds true for the loop to execute the first time.
   - Given the current states, `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)` and `high` is defined as `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, the condition `high >= low` is inherently satisfied because `high` is the maximum of the two values and `low` is the minimum.

Since the condition `high >= low` is always true based on the definitions of `low` and `high`, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop executes the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is equal to `low`**
