Output State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated based on the input provided. The initial value of `t` remains `k-1` since no operation changes its value. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are now the integers input by the user.
