Output State: `t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `cur` will be equal to `high`. This is because the loop continues to increment `cur` by 1 until `high` is no longer greater than or equal to `cur`. At that point, the loop exits, and `cur` holds the final value of `high`. The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
