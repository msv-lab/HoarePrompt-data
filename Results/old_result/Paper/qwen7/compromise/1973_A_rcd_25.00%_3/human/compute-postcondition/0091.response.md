Output State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `low` remain unchanged.
