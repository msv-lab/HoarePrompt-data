### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine its correctness:

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is a crucial check because the total points must be even for the scores to be achievable through a valid sequence of games (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in a draw).

3. **Handling Invalid Scores:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. This condition ensures that the highest score is not less than the sum of the other two scores, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be achievable. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to validate the scores.

4. **Finding Maximum Draws:**
   - The program calculates the lower bound (`low`) and upper bound (`high`) for the number of draws.
   - It initializes `cur` to `low` and iterates while `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current number of draws (`cur`) is feasible by comparing the adjusted scores of `p1` and `p2`.
   - If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no valid number of draws is found within the bounds, it prints `p3`.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it should ensure that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.
   - The condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` is not sufficient to validate the scores. It should be checked whether the scores can be achieved through a valid sequence of games.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum Draws:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is flawed. The program assumes that the scores can always be adjusted by a certain number of draws, which is not necessarily true.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not correctly formulated to ensure the scores are achievable.

3. **Output for Valid Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. It prints `p1 + p2` or `p3` without ensuring these values are achievable through a valid sequence of games.

#### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the scores are achievable through a valid sequence of games. Here's a corrected approach:

1. **Check if the total points are even.**
2. **Check if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores.**
3. **Calculate the maximum number of draws by iterating through possible values and checking if the scores are achievable.**

Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 < p1 + p2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        max_draws = 0
        for d in range(min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) + 1):
            if (p1 - d) * 2 + d == p1 and (p2 - (p3 - d)) * 2 + d == p2:
                max_draws = d
                break
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation

After analyzing the corrected program and the original assessment, we can conclude that the original assessment was accurate. The original program had logical flaws and did not correctly determine the maximum number of draws.

**Final: False**
