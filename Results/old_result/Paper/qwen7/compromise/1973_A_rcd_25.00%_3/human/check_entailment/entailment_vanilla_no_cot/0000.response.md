Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. The current approach does not correctly account for the constraints and relationships between the scores of the three players.

2. **Handling of Draw Conditions**: The code does not properly handle the conditions where the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution does not correctly handle edge cases such as when the scores are inconsistent or when the maximum number of draws cannot be determined accurately.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the total score is even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the total number of games played
        total_games = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        
        # Initialize variables to store the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = -1
        
        # Iterate over possible number of games won by the first player
        for w1 in range(total_games + 1):
            for w2 in range(total_games + 1 - w1):
                w3 = total_games - w1 - w2
                
                # Calculate the scores based on the number of wins
                s1 = 2 * w1 + (total_games - w1 - w2)
                s2 = 2 * w2 + (total_games - w1 - w2)
                s3 = 2 * w3 + (total_games - w1 - w2)
                
                # Check if the calculated scores match the given scores
                if s1 == p1 and s2 == p2 and s3 == p3:
                    # Calculate the number of draws
                    draws = total_games - (w1 + w2 + w3)
                    max_draws = max(max_draws, draws)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected solution iterates over all possible combinations of wins and calculates the corresponding number of draws to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened. It ensures that the scores are consistent with the given constraints and handles edge cases appropriately.
