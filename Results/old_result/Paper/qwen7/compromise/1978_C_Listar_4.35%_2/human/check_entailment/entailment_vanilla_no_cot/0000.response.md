To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` collectively solve the problem as described.

### Analysis

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if a given `k` can be achieved with a permutation of length `n`.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `max_k` (the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`) is less than `k`.
   - If `k` is even and within the possible range, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function attempts to construct a permutation with the given `n` and `k`.
   - It seems to try to build the permutation by moving elements around to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - However, the logic in this function is flawed. Specifically, the way it manipulates the list `l` does not correctly compute the Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function prints the result "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - It takes a list `l` as input and prints it.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to check if a solution exists and then calls `func_1` and `func_3` to either print "NO" or the constructed permutation.

### Issues with `func_1`

The main issue with `func_1` is that it does not correctly compute the Manhattan value and does not ensure that the constructed permutation meets the required Manhattan value `k`. The logic for constructing the permutation is not sound and may produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with `func_1`, the overall program cannot be considered correct because it fails to properly construct a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value `k`.

**Correctness: False**
