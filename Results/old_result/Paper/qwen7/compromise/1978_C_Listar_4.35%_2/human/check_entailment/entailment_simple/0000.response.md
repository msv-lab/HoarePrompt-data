### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as input and checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as input and constructs a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value is `k`. It works by rotating the list `[1, 2, ..., n]` to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The key idea is to rotate the list to the left by `k/2` positions (since the Manhattan value is symmetric and we can achieve the required value by appropriate rotations).

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation list `l` and then returns nothing.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`. If `n` is zero, it prints "NO" and returns. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:

- The overall logic of the program is sound. It correctly handles the cases where `k` is odd or when `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
- The `func_1` function correctly generates a permutation with the desired Manhattan value by rotating the list.
- The `func_3` function correctly prints the permutation in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.
