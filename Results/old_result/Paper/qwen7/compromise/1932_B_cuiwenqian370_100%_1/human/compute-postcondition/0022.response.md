Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, which is calculated as follows: 

Starting from the initial value of `last_year`, the loop iteratively updates `last_year` using the formula `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, `last_year` will be the final value obtained after applying this update formula `n-1` times.

In simpler terms, `last_year` will be the result of repeatedly applying the given formula for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, starting with the initial value of `last_year`.
