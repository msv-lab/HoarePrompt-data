Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])**.

Explanation: The variable `next_year` is updated to the value of `((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])`. Given that `i` is 2, this expression simplifies to `((last_year + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2])`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `last_year` remain unchanged from their initial states.
