Output State: **`index` is increased by `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is equal to `a[0]`, `results` is a list containing a single string element which is the final value of `last_year` converted to a string, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input data starting from `data[index]` and having a length of `n`.**

Explanation: The code sets `last_year` to the value of `a[0]`. This updates the value of `last_year` but does not affect the values of `index`, `i`, `results`, `T`, or the list `a`. The value of `i` remains equal to `n` because the code does not change its value.
