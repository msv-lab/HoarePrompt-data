Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is 4, `next_year` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` is a list containing the string "4", `index` is increased by `n`.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `index` being increased by `n`.
