Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is 4, `next_year` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` is a list containing the string "4", `index` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` converts the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers. The values of `i`, `last_year`, `next_year`, `results`, and `index` remain unchanged from their initial states except that `a` is now a list of integers derived from the specified slice of `data`.
