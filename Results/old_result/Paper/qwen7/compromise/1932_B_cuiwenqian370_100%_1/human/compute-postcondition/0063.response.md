Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is the final value obtained by successively updating `last_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and `results` contains a string representation of `next_year` repeated `T` times.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the elements of the `results` list, which contains the string representation of `next_year` repeated `T` times, to the standard output, separated by newlines. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `last_year`, `next_year`, or `results`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the `results` list now contains the string representation of `next_year` repeated `T` times and has been printed to the standard output.
