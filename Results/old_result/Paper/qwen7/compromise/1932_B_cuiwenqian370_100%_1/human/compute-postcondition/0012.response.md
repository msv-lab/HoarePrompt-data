Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` should start at 1 because the loop starts from 1 (inclusive) and goes up to `n` (exclusive).
   - `n` is derived from `data[index]`, so we need to ensure that `data[index]` is a valid integer and that `n` is a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.

4. **State the final state after adjustment**:
   - `i` should be set to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state where `T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `index` is increased by `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, and `last_year` is the first element of list `a`, the relevant states to adjust are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
