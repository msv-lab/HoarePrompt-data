Output State: The loop will have executed all its iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `n`, `last_year` being equal to the final value obtained by successively updating it using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and `results` containing a single string element which is the final value of `last_year` converted to a string.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `last_year` will hold the final computed value based on the given formula applied successively for each element in the list `a`. The `results` list will contain this final value as a string.
