Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])**.

Explanation: The code `last_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `last_year`. Since `next_year` is defined as `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])`, `last_year` is updated to have the same value as `next_year`. All other variables remain unchanged.
