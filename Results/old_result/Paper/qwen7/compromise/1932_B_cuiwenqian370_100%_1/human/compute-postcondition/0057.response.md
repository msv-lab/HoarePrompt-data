Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), `last_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2])**.

Explanation: The code `last_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `last_year`. Since `next_year` is defined as `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])` and also as `((last_year + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2])`, these expressions remain unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `next_year`) retain their original conditions and values as per the initial state.
