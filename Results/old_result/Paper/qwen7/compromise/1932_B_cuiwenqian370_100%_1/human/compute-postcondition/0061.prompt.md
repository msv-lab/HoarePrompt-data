Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the list `data`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    last_year = a[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
        last_year = next_year
    results.append(str(last_year))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_year` is the result of applying the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` starting with the initial value of `last_year`, `results` is a list containing a single string element which is the final value of `last_year` converted to a string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is 4, `next_year` is 4, `a[1]` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string "4"

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to the final value obtained by successively updating `last_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and `results` contains a single element which is a string representation of `next_year`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
