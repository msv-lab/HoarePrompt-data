You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        last_year = a[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        
        results.append(str(last_year))
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is the final value obtained by successively updating `last_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and `results` contains a string representation of `next_year` repeated `T` times.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `last_year` will be the same as `next_year` and will be the result of applying the given formula for each element in the list `a` for all iterations specified by `T`. The `results` list will contain this final value of `last_year` converted to a string and repeated `T` times, as the loop appends the final `last_year` value to the `results` list in each iteration.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a list of integers within specified ranges for each test case defined by t and n. It returns a value based on the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and n is between 1 and 100 inclusive, for each of the t test cases where t is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
