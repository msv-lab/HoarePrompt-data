Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the split data to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining periodicities, calculating the next year when the next sign will occur. This calculation is done correctly by ensuring the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The line `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`. This is equivalent to:
     ```python
     next_year = ((last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i]) * a[i]
     ```
   - This logic is correct because it finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - The final year for each test case is stored in the `results` list as a string.

5. **Output:**
   - The program writes the results to stdout, joining them with newlines.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The calculations and logic are sound and match the problem requirements.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
