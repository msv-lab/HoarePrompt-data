Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates the number of times Bob can win by simply counting the number of odd values in the list and dividing each value by 2, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the bitwise XOR operation and how removing numbers affects the overall XOR result. The program should focus on maintaining the parity of the XOR result, ensuring that Bob can win the maximum number of times by strategically removing numbers that would keep the XOR result zero. The current implementation does not account for this logic and thus fails to provide the correct output for the given test cases.
