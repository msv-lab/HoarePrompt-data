Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` which is being assigned the value from the list `a` during each iteration.

2. **Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `a` must be a list of integers because the loop iterates over each element of `a`.
   - The variable `x` will take the value of the first element of `a` during the first iteration, but since we are adjusting the state before the loop starts, we don't need to specify its initial value yet.
   - The variable `cnt` is determined based on the values of the first three elements of `a` after the loop starts executing. However, for the loop to start, `a` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `a` must be a list of integers for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `a` is initialized as such.
   - We do not need to adjust the initial value of `x` or `cnt` because their values will be determined within the loop itself based on the elements of `a`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it is a list of integers.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers**, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` remains 0 (since the value of `cnt` is determined inside the loop based on the first three elements of `a`).
