Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) represents the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `x` is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is the sum of 4 (from the first iteration) plus the floor division of each subsequent element of `a` by 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

In this final state, `x` will be the last element processed by the loop from the list `a`. The variable `cnt` will have been incremented by 1 for each element in `a` that was processed, starting from 3 (as given by the state after the first iteration). Therefore, `cnt` will be equal to 3 plus the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is the sum of the floor divisions of all elements in the original list `a` by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
