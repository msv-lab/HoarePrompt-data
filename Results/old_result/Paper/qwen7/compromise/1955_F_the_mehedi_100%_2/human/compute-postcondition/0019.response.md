Output State: **`a` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `x` is the second-to-last element of `a`, `cnt` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables (`a`, `x`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
