Based on the initial state provided:

- After all iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list.
- `cnt` is the sum of the floor divisions of all elements in the original list `a` by 2.

Since `a` is an empty list, there are no elements to perform the floor division operation on. Therefore, the sum of the floor divisions of all elements in the original list `a` by 2 is 0.

Output: **0**
