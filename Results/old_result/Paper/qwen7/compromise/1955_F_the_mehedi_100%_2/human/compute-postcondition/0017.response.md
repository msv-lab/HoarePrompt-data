Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `x` is the last element of `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `cnt` is the sum of 4 (from the first iteration) plus the floor division of each subsequent element of `a` by 2.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will run for a number of iterations equal to the integer input provided.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - Each iteration processes an element from the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element processed, starting from 3 (as given by the state after the first iteration).
   - `cnt` also gets incremented by the floor division of the current element of `a` by 2.

4. **Final State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is the last element of `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is the sum of 4 plus the floor division of each element of `a` by 2 up to the last processed element.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element from `a` must be processed.
   - `cnt` will be incremented by 1 and by the floor division of the next element of `a` by 2.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `x` will now be the second-to-last element of `a`.
- `a` remains the same list of integers.
- `cnt` will be incremented by 1 and by the floor division of the next element of `a` by 2.
- `t` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`x` is the second-to-last element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is the sum of 4 plus the floor division of each element of `a` by 2 up to the second-to-last processed element, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
