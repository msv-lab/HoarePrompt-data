Postcondition: `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `x` is the first element of the updated list `a`, `cnt` is 1 if the remainder of each of the first three elements of `a` when divided by 2 is 1 (i.e., they are all odd). Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `x` is the first element of `a`, and `t` is a positive integer input from the user.
