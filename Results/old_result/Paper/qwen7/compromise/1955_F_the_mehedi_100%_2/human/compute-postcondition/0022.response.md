Postcondition: `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `x` is the second-to-last element of `a`, `cnt` is 1, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, provided that the first three elements of `a` are all odd. If the first three elements of `a` are not all odd, then `cnt` remains 0.
