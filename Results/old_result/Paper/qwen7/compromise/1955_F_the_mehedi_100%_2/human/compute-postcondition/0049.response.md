Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is the sum of the floor divisions of all elements in the original list `a` by 2, and `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

In this final state, the list `a` has been fully processed, and `cnt` contains the total sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 across all iterations of the loop.
