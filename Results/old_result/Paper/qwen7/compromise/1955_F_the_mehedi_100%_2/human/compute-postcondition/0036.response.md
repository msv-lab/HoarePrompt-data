Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 1, and `t` is a positive integer input from the user. If the first, second, and third elements of the list `a` are all odd, then `cnt` remains 1. If any of these elements are not odd, then the condition does not affect the value of `cnt`.
