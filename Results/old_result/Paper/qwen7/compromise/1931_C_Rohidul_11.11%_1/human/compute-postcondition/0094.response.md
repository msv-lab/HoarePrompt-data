Output State: **`l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 2, `st` is 1**

The variable `st` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (implied to be 0 since no initial value is given for `st`). The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` is still 3, `r` must still be greater than 2, and `st` is now 1.
