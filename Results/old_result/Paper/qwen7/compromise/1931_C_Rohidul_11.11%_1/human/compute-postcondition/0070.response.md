Output State: **`ans` is `n - 3`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `2 * n - 2`, the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `r - l - 1`. Given that `r` and `l` are both equal to `n - 1`, the calculation simplifies to `(n - 1) - (n - 1) - 1`, which results in `-1 - 1` or `-2`. However, since we are dealing with integer subtraction, the result is `n - 3`. All other variables (`l`, `r`, `st`, `end`) retain their original values, and the condition that the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a` remains unchanged.
