Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is either `n - 3` or `0` depending on whether the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

The code updates the values of `l` and `r` to `0` and `n - 1` respectively, while keeping `st` and `end` unchanged. The value of `ans` remains the same as it was in the initial state, depending on the condition specified.
