Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` becomes `n - 2`. The values of `l`, `st`, and `end` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `n - 1`, and `end` is increased by 1.
