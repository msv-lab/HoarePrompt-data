Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is `end + 3`, `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is `- (n - 2)`**

Explanation: The code `ans = r - l` calculates the difference between `r` and `l`. Given that `r` is 0 and `l` is `n - 2`, the value of `ans` is `0 - (n - 2)`, which simplifies to `- (n - 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
