Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Determine the relevant variables**: The relevant variables in the loop head are `r`, `l`, and `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is equal to `n - 1`
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `st` is `n - 1`
- `end` is increased by 1

We need to determine how to adjust these variables so that the loop condition `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]` can be satisfied for the next iteration.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than `l`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

4. **Current values**:
   - `l` is `n - 1`
   - `r` is `n - 1`

Since both `l` and `r` are equal to `n - 1`, the condition `r > l` is already false. Therefore, the loop will not execute again with the current values of `l` and `r`.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - To satisfy `r > l`, we need to change either `r` or `l` such that `r` becomes greater than `l`.
   - To satisfy `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, we need to ensure that the elements at positions `r` and `r - 1` are equal.

Since `r` and `l` are both `n - 1`, we need to adjust `r` or `l` to make `r > l`. One way to achieve this is to decrease `r` or increase `l`.

However, since `r` and `l` are initially set to `n - 1`, decreasing `r` would make it less than `l`, which is not allowed by the condition `r > l`. Therefore, we need to increase `l`.

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - Increase `l` by 1 to make `l` equal to `n - 2`.
   - Ensure `r` remains `n - 1` to check the condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `l` must be increased by 1 to become `n - 2`.

State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is increased by 1**
