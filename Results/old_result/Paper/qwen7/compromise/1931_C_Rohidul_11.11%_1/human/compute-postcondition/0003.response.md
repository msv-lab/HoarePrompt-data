Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r`. `l` is assigned the value `0`, and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `a` also remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it.
