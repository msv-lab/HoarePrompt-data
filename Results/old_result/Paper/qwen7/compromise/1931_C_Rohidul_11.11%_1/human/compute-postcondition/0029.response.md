Output State: **`l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 3, `r` is decreased by 3, `ans` is `r - l - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = r - l - 1` calculates the value of `ans` based on the current values of `r` and `l`. Since `r` is decreased by 3, the new value of `r` is `r - 3`. The value of `l` remains unchanged, and `st` and `end` are also unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is calculated as `r - 3 - l - 1`, which simplifies to `r - l - 4`. However, since the exact values of `r` and `l` are not specified, we keep the expression as `r - l - 1` with the understanding that `r` has been decreased by 3.
