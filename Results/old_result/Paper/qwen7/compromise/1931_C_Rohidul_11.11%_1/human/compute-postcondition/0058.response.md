Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `l` is equal to `n - 1`
   - `r` is greater than `l`
   - `st` is `n - 1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `l = n - 1`
   - `r > l` (since `r` is greater than `l`)
   - `a[r] == a[r - 1]` (this condition is not explicitly given but assumed to hold for the loop to continue)

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `r` must be greater than `l`.
   - Since `l` is `n - 1`, `r` must be `n` for the condition `r > l` to be true.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `r` to be `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`l` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is `n`, `st` is `n - 1`**
