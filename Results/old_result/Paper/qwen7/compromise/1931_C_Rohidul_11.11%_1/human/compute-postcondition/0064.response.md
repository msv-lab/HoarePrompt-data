Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `r` is greater than `l` and the element at index `r` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `l` is `n - 2`
   - `r` is `n - 2`
   - `st` is `n - 1`
   - `end` is `n + 1`

3. **Check Loop Condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, both `l` and `r` are `n - 2`.
   - Therefore, the condition `r > l` evaluates to `False` because `r` is not greater than `l`.

4. **Determine Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `r > l` must evaluate to `True` in the next iteration.
   - Additionally, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `l` and `r` are currently equal (`n - 2`), we need to change either `l` or `r` (or both) to satisfy `r > l`.
   - We also need to ensure that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true for the next iteration.

Given these points, we need to adjust the values of `l` and `r` such that `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true.

### Example Answer:
The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those two variables. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `r` to be greater than `l` and ensure `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Since `l` and `r` are both `n - 2`, we need to increment `r` to make `r > l`. Let's assume `r` is incremented to `n - 1` (which is `st`).

State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `n + 1`**

However, we also need to ensure that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true. If `a[n - 1]` is equal to `a[n - 2]`, then the condition will be satisfied.

State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `n + 1` and `a[n - 1]` must be equal to `a[n - 2]`**

Thus, the final state to ensure the loop executes one more time is:

State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `n + 1` and `a[n - 1]` must be equal to `a[n - 2]`**
