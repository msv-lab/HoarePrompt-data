Output State: **`l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**.

The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
