Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `l` is less than `r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l` is 1
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`
   - `st` is 1
   - `end` is 0

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.
   - Since `l` is currently 1, `a[l]` is `a[1]`.
   - For `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to be true, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` are true for the next iteration.
   - Since `l` is 1, we need `a[1] == a[2]` to be true.
   - Also, `l` should be incremented by 1 in the loop body, so `l` should be adjusted to 2.
   - `r` remains `n - 1` because it is not affected by the current condition.

### Final State Adjustment:

- `l` must be 2.
- `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`l` is 2, `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`**
