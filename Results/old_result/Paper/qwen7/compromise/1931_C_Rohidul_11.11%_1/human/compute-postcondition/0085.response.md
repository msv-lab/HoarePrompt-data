Output State: **`l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are all equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is either `n - 3` or `0` depending on whether the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, `ans`, and the condition regarding the first and last elements of `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values and conditions.
