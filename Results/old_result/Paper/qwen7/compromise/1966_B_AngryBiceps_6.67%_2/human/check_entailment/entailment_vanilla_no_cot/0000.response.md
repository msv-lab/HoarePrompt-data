Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The logic in the solution is flawed because it only checks the first and last elements of the first and last rows, which is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if all rows are the same or if all columns are the same. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        all_rows_same = all(row == a[0] for row in a)
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        all_columns_same = all(all(a[i][j] == a[0][0] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m))
        
        if all_rows_same or all_columns_same:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself.
2. It checks if all rows are the same by comparing each row to the first row.
3. It checks if all columns are the same by ensuring every element in each column matches the element at position (0, 0).
4. If either condition is true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This approach ensures that the solution correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
