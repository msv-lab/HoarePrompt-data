Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a`, the variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the new length of `a`, `m` is an integer input by the user.**

The code `first_row = ''` simply assigns an empty string to the variable `first_row`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `last_row`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. The value of `first_row` is explicitly set to an empty string, so we update that accordingly. All other variables retain their previous values.
