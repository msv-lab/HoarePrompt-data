Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a` plus the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding the first character of the last element in the list `a` to its current value. Since `first_row` was initially the first character of the last element in the list `a`, after executing `first_row += a[-1][0]`, `first_row` becomes the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
