You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the grid is represented as an n × m matrix where each element is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `a` is a list containing all the inputs provided by the user, with each input as a separate element. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a`. `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a`. The variable `i` is equal to `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. `n` is the final length of the list `a`, which is determined by the number of test cases provided.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as an n × m matrix where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. Each element in the grid is either 'W' or 'B'. The function returns information about the grid based on the given constraints, including the dimensions n and m, and the elements 'W' and 'B'.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
