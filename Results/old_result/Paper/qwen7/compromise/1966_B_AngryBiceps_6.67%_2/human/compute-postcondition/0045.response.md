Output State: **`a` is a list with an additional input value appended to it, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the sum of its previous value and the last element of the last list in `a` plus the last element of the last list in `a`, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the last list in `a` increased by the first element of the last list in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments `last_row` by the last element of the last list in `a`. Since `last_row` was previously the sum of its previous value and the last element of the last list in `a`, it now becomes the sum of its previous value, the last element of the last list in `a`, and the last element of the last list in `a` again. The `first_row` remains unchanged as it was already increased by the first element of the last list in `a`. All other variables (`a`, `i`, `n`, `last_row`, and `first_row`) retain their previous conditions and values.
