Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The relevant variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user.
   - `first_row` is the first element of that input.
   - `last_row` is increased by the last element of the only list in `a`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` would be 0 (if it was the first iteration) or incremented by 1 from the previous value.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Given that no modifications to `n` are mentioned in the problem, we assume `n` remains the same. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Since `i` starts from 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1 (since it was 0 in the previous iteration and is incremented by 1).
- `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user; `first_row` is the first element of that input; `last_row` is increased by the last element of the only list in `a`; `i` is 1; `n` remains the same**.
