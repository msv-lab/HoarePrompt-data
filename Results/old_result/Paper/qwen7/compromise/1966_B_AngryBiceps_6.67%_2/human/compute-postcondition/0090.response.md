Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from the user, `first_row` is composed of the first characters of all elements in `a` up to the last one, `last_row` is composed of the last characters of all the elements in `a` up to the last one. If the first character of the third element in `a` is the same as all other characters in the first element of `a` and the first element of `a` is not the same as the last element of `a`, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.
