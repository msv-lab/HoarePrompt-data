Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` contains an input value, `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the last list in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` updates the value of `last_row` by adding the last element of the last list in the variable `a`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
