Postcondition: `t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first input integer value, `x` is the second input integer value, `n` is the original value of `n` minus 1. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `-1`.
