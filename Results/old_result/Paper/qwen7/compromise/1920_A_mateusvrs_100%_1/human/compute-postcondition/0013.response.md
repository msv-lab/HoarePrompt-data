Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 2, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer not equal to 1, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates `ax` to be the minimum between `x` and `ax`. Given that `x` is an input integer and the current value of `ax` is 1000000007, and since `x` is an input, we take the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `x` is less than or equal to 2, `ax` will be set to `x`; otherwise, it remains 2. Since `x` is an input, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `ax` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
