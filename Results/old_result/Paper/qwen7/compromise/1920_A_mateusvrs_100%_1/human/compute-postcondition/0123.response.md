Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first input integer value, `x` is the second input integer value.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains 1, `r` remains `[0, 0]`, `cx` remains an empty set, `ax` remains 1000000000, and `bx` remains -1. The values of `a` and `x` are now the first and second input integers respectively.
