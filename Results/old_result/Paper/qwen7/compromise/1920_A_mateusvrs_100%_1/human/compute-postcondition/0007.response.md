Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable involved here is `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know the following from the given state before the loop:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `cx` is an empty set.
   - `ax` is 1000000007.
   - `bx` is -1.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1**
