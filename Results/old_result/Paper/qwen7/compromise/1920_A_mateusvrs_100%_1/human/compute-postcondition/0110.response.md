Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx`. The condition for incrementing `tmp` is that `i` should be within the range `[ax, bx]`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value.
   - `i` is the next element in `cx`.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `cx`, it means that `i` was the last element processed in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `cx`.
   - The condition for incrementing `tmp` is that `i` should be within the range `[ax, bx]`. However, since we are determining the state before the next iteration, we do not know if `i` will satisfy this condition yet.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `cx` remains the same because it is a set and its contents do not change within the loop unless explicitly modified outside the loop.
   - `i` becomes the next element in `cx`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value, `i` is the next element in `cx`**.
