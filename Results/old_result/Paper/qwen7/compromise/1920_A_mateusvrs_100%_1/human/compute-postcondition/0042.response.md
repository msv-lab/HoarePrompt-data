Output State: **`i` is an integer, `bx` and `ax` are integers where `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is increased by 1.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `i`, `bx`, and `ax` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain the same. Therefore, the updated state includes that `tmp` has been increased by 1.
