Postcondition: **Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be 0, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last input integer values provided before the loop terminates. The current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`.**
