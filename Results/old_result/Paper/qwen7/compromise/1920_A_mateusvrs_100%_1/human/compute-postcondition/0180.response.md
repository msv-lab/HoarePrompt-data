Based on the initial state provided, the variable `t` is 0, and the list `r` is already initialized as `[0, 0, 0]`. Since `t` is 0, the loop does not execute any iterations, and the values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` do not change from their initial states. Therefore, the list `r` remains `[0, 0, 0]`.

The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line due to the `sep='\n'` parameter.

Output: **0
0
0**
