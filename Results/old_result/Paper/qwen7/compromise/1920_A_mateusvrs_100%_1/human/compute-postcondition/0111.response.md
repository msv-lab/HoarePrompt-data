Output State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is `tmp` plus 1.**

In this case, `tmp` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `tmp` before the increment is not specified. Therefore, we can only say that `tmp` is now `tmp` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
