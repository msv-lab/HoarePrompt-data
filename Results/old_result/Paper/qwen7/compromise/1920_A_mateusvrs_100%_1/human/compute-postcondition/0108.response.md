Output State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value; `i` is the next element in `cx`; `tmp` is `tmp` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `cx` and `i` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `cx` still contains at least one unique `x` value, `i` is still the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is now `tmp` plus 1.
