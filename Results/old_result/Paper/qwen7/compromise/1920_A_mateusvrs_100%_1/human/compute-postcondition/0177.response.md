Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0] or [ax - bx + 1 - tmp], `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values provided, `bx` is -1, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided before the loop terminates, `n` is 0, and `tmp` reflects the count of `x` values in `cx` that fall within the range defined by `bx` and `ax` if `bx` is greater than `ax`; otherwise, `r` is [0, 0].**
