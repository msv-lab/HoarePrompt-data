Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(n)` function. The variables involved in the loop head are `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `r` is an empty list
   - `n` must be greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1
   - `cx` is a set containing `x`
   - `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`
   - `bx` is -1
   - `a` and `x` are input integers
   - If `a` equals 1, `ax` is 2; if `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`; otherwise, `cx` is updated to be a set containing `x`, and `ax` remains as 2 if `a` is 2, or 1000000007 if `a` is not 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - All other variables (`t`, `r`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `r` is an empty list
- `n` must be greater than 0 (and will be decreased by 1 again)
- `cx` is a set containing `x`
- `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`
- `bx` is -1
- `a` and `x` are input integers

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is -1, `a` and `x` are input integers**
