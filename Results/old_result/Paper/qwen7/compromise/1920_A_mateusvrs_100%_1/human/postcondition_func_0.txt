The function processes multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints. For each test case, it determines the minimum (`ax`) and maximum (`bx`) values of `x` for certain types of constraints. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of `x` values in a set (`cx`) that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and appends the difference between `ax - bx + 1` minus the count of these values to the result list. Finally, it prints the result list, which contains either 0s or calculated differences for each test case.
