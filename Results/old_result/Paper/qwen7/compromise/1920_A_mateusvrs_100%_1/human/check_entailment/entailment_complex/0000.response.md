Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function.
2. The function processes each test case independently.
3. For each test case, it initializes `ax` to a large value and `bx` to -1.
4. It iterates over the constraints, updating `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` accordingly.
5. After processing all constraints for a test case, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values and appends this value to the result list.
6. The function ensures that all constraints are processed and handles the edge case where `bx` is greater than `ax` correctly.
7. The final result is printed as expected.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function appears to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
