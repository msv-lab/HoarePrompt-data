Postcondition: **`eta` is a list containing the integers `1`, `1`, and `3`; `q` is a list where each element `q[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) has been decremented by `1` for each iteration where `q[j]` was greater than `0`; `rho` is `q[1]`, `j` is `n+1`, `n` remains unchanged, `eta_ln` is `1` if the condition `eta_ln == 1` is true, and `res` is calculated as `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho` if the condition `eta_ln == 1` is false, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[1]] + q[eta[2]] + q[eta[3]]`.**
