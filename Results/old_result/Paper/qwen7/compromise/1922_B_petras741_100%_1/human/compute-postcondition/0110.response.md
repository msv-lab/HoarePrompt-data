Postcondition: **`rho` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `eta`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `range(n + 1)` for which `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and `j` is equal to `eta_ln`.**

Explanation: If `eta_ln` is equal to 1, then `rho` remains unchanged as `q[eta[0]]` and `eta` is a list containing only one element. Otherwise, after the loop completes, `rho` is updated to be the sum of all elements in the list `eta`, `j` is set to `eta_ln`, and `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.
