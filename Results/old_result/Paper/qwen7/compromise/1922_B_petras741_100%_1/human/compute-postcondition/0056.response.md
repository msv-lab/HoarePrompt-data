Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list containing the integers `1`, `1`, and `3`; `q` is a list where each element `q[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) has been decremented by `1` for each iteration where `q[j]` was greater than `0`; `rho` is `q[1]`, `j` is `n+1`, `n` remains unchanged, `eta_ln` is `1` if the condition `eta_ln == 1` is true, and `res` is calculated as specified. If `n` is less than 3, `t`, `buffer`, `i`, `n`, and `w` remain unchanged.
