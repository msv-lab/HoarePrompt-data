Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` is 1, so for the next iteration, `j` should be 2 (since `j` starts from 0).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - The value of `q[w[j]]` will be incremented again because `j` is now 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`j` is 2; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**
