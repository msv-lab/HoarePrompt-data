Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The condition for the loop is `j < eta_ln`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 4.
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than 4.
   - `res` is the sum of several terms involving `q[eta[i]]` and `rho`.
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[4]] + q[eta[4]]`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 5.
   - The condition `j < eta_ln` must still hold true, meaning `eta_ln` must still be greater than 4.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `j` is updated to 5.
   - `eta_ln` remains unchanged as it must still be greater than 4.
   - `res` remains unchanged as it does not depend on `j` directly.
   - `rho` remains unchanged as it does not depend on `j` directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `eta_ln`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 5, `eta_ln` must be greater than 4**
