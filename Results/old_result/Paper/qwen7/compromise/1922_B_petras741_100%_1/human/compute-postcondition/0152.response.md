Output State: **`j` is 2, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged, and `eta_ln` still holds the length of the list `eta`.
