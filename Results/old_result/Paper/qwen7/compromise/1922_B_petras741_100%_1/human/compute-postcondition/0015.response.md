Output State: **`eta` is an empty list, `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes an empty list `eta`. The initial state of `q` is not specified, but it is mentioned that `q` is updated during the loop such that `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`. Since no operations are performed on `q` within the given code snippet, the state of `q` remains as it was before the loop's execution, with each `q[w[j]]` incremented exactly once for the corresponding index `w[j]` during the loop's iterations. The list `eta` is left unchanged and remains an empty list.
