Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, eta_ln)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `eta_ln - 1`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.

3. **Check the given initial states**:
   - `eta_ln` is already the length of the list `eta`, so no adjustment is needed for `eta_ln`.
   - `j` is initially set to `n`, but the loop starts with `j = 1`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to start from 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` needs to start from 1, we need to adjust `j` to be 1.
   - `eta_ln` remains as the length of the list `eta`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`j` is 1, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`**
