Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(1, eta_ln):`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `j` is currently 3.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.
   - `res` has been modified by adding two terms based on the values in `q` and `rho`.
   - `rho` has been incremented by `q[eta[j]]`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `eta_ln`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `4`.
   - `eta_ln` remains unchanged as it is an external variable not modified within the loop.
   - `res` and `rho` are not directly modified by the loop itself but are updated based on the value of `j` inside the loop. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we do not need to update `res` or `rho` here.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `j` will be 4.
   - `eta_ln` remains the same (length of the list `eta`).
   - No changes are made to `res` or `rho` as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 4, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`**
