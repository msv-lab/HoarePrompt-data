Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `j` is 0
  - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for j in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be `1`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become `1`.
   - The expression `q[w[j]]` will be evaluated with `j` now being `1`.

### Updated State:
- `j` is now `1`.
- `q[w[j]]` (which is `q[w[1]]`) will be incremented by 1.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is 1; `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1**
