Output State: **`a` is a list containing three elements, where the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the new input provided by the user, and the third element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the last character of the last element in `a`; `i` is `n - 2`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the current input from the user to the list `a`. Since `a` initially had two elements, after appending, it now has three elements. The values of `first_row` and `last_row` are not affected by this operation, and the value of `i` remains unchanged as it was defined before the append operation.
