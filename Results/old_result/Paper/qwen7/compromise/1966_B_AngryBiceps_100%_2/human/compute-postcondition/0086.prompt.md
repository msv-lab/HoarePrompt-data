Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n × m over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input provided by the user during the respective iteration of the loop; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a`, repeated according to their position in the list; `i` is `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations; `n` remains as the initial input provided by the user; and `first_row` and `last_row` reflect the cumulative concatenations as described. If the first element of `a` consists of a single unique character, the last element of `a` also consists of a single unique character, and the first and last elements of `a` are different, then the function continues with these conditions. Otherwise, the function continues with the conditions where the first character of the first string in `a` is not the same for all strings in `a` or the last character of the last string in `a` is not the same for all strings in `a` or both.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the input provided by the user at each iteration; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `i` is `n - 1`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user; `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user. Additionally, either the first row and last row consist of only one unique character and they are different, or the first row and last row do not consist of only one unique character and/or they are the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input provided by the user; `first_row` is a concatenation of the first characters of all these inputs; `last_row` is a concatenation of the last characters of all these inputs; `i` is `-1`; if the set of the first character of the first element in `a` contains exactly one unique character, the set of the last character of the last element in `a` contains exactly one unique character, and the first character of the first element in `a` is not equal to the last character of the last element in `a`, then `first_row` and `last_row` are not equal. Otherwise, the set of the first character of the first element in `a` is not a single character, the set of the last character of the last element in `a` is not a single character, or the first character of the first element in `a` is equal to the last character of the last element in `a`, and `first_row` and `last_row` either both consist of exactly one unique character and are not equal to each other, or one of them is a single character or the same as the other.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
