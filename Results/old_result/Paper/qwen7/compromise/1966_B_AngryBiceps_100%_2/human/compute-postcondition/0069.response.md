Output State: **`a` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the initial input provided by the user and the second element is the new input provided by the user; `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the last character of the last element in `a`; `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to `last_row`. Since `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is updated by concatenating this character to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.
