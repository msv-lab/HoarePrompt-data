Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input provided by the user.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in the list `a`, concatenated together.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in the list `a`, concatenated together.
- `i` is `-1`, as the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The set of the first character of the first element in `a` contains exactly one unique character.
- The set of the last character of the last element in `a` contains exactly one unique character.
- The first character of the first element in `a` is not equal to the last character of the last element in `a`.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
