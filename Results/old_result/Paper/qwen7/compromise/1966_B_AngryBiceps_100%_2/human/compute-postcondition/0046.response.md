Output State: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the input provided by the user at each iteration; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `i` is `n - 1`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user; `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user as a list. `first_row` will be a string made up of the first character from each input string in `a`. Similarly, `last_row` will be a string made up of the last character from each input string in `a`. The variable `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop decrements `i` in each iteration but stops before `i` reaches `-1`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
