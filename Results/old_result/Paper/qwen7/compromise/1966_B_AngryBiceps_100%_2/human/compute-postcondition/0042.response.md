Output State: **`a` is a list containing three elements, the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the previous input provided by the user, and the third element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the last element in `a` and the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` plus the last character of the last element in `a`; `i` is `n + 1`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(input())` appends the current input provided by the user to the list `a`.
- The length of `a` increases by one, making it a list with three elements.
- The variables `first_row` and `last_row` are defined based on the last element of `a`, which remains unchanged in terms of their definition.
- The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the append operation.
