Output State: **`a` is a list with one element which is the input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the value returned by `input()` to the list `a`. Since no initial value for `a` is given, we assume `a` is initially an empty list. After executing the code, `a` will contain one element, which is the string input provided by the user.
