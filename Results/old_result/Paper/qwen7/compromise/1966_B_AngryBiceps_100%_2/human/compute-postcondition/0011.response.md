Output State: **`a` is a list with two elements, the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the new input provided by the user, `first_row` is the concatenation of `first_row` and the first character of the last element of `a`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1; `last_row` is the last character of the new input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element of the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Here, `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`, which is the new input provided by the user, and `[0]` refers to the first character of this new input. The value of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `last_row` still holds the last character of the new input provided by the user.
