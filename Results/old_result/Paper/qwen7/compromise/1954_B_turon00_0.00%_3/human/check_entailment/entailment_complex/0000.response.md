Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array `a` and creates a set `aa` containing all unique elements of `a`.
4. If the set `aa` has only one element, it means the array is already beautiful, and the program correctly prints `-1`.
5. It then iterates through the array `a` to find the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element (`tmp`). This is done using the variable `cnt`.
6. After processing each element, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.
7. Finally, it prints the minimum value of `cnt` found during the iteration for each test case.
8. The overall logic seems to be correct for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, based on the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
