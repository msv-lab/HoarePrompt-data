You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the given array a is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0, `ans` will be the minimum value among all calculated `cnt` values across all test cases, `tmp` will be the first element of the list `a` from the last test case processed, `aa` will be a set containing all unique elements from the list `a` of the last test case, and `n` will be the length of the list `a` from the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a set. If they are, it prints `-1` because removing any element won't change the fact that the array remains beautiful.
   - This part is correct.

3. **Counting Identical Elements**:
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and a set `aa` with all unique elements in the array.
   - If there's only one unique element, it prints `-1`, which is correct.

4. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive identical elements.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates the answer with the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found so far.
   - This logic seems to be aimed at finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition, but there's a flaw in this approach.

### Flawed Logic

- The program assumes that the minimum removals required is the minimum count of consecutive identical elements. However, this is not always true.
- Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The minimum count of consecutive identical elements is `1` (for both `1`s and `2`s), but the actual minimum removals required to make the array non-beautiful is `1` (remove any one `1` or `2`).

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the longest sequence of identical elements and ensure that we remove enough elements to break the beauty condition. Here’s a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        max_len = 1
        current_len = 1
        
        # Find the length of the longest sequence of identical elements
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i-1]:
                current_len += 1
                max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
            else:
                current_len = 1
        
        # If the entire array is identical, it's impossible to make it non-beautiful
        if max_len == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # Otherwise, the minimum removals required is the length of the longest sequence minus one
            print(max_len - 1)

# Call the function
func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a logical flaw and does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
