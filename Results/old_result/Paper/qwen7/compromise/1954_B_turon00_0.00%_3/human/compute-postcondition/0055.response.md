Output State: **`i` is 1; `cnt` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 1 and no changes were made to it, its value remains unchanged. The value of `cnt` is now 1 because it was incremented from its initial state of 0 (implied since it's not initialized elsewhere in the given snippet).
