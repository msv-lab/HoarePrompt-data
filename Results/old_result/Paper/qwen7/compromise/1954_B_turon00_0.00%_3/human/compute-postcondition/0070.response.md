Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value between its initial value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`ans`, `cnt`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` as an input integer and retains the original values of the other variables.
