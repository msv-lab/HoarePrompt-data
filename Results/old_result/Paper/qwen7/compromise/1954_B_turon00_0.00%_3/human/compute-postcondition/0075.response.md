Postcondition: **`ans` is the minimum value between its initial value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1`. Since the if condition `len(aa) == 1` is the only condition provided and there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
