Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `t` is `t - 1`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
