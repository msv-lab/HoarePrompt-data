Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was previously incremented by 1 if the element at index 4 in list `a` equals `tmp`, here it is incremented again by 1. Therefore, `cnt` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
