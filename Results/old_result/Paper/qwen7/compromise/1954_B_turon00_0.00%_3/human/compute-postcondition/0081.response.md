Output State: **`ans` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 1, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `t` is `t - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
