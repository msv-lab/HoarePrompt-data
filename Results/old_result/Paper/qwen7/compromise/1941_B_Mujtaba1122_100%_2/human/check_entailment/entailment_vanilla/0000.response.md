### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the described operations and checks if it's possible to make all elements zero.
- The function `func_1` is used to verify if the array is all zeros, which is necessary to determine the final result.
- The program structure ensures that the operations are applied in a way that respects the constraints and checks for invalid states.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem statement and the implementation of the functions, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

### Correctness:
**True**
