### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`, and if all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly implements the described operations. It iterates through the array and applies the specified operation when the conditions are met. However, there are a few issues with the logic:
    - The operation `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` should be `list[i+1] -= list[i-1]` to ensure the correct reduction.
    - The operation `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]` is correct.
    - The operation `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` should be `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]` to ensure the correct reduction.
  - The function checks if `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation and prints 'NO' and returns immediately. This is correct because if `list[i-1]` is not zero, it means the operation cannot be performed as intended.
  - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Issues in the Implementation:

1. **Incorrect Operations**:
   - The operations `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` and `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` should be simplified to `list[i+1] -= list[i-1]` and `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]` respectively.

2. **Logic Flow**:
   - The logic flow in `func_2` is correct, but the operations need to be corrected to ensure they are applied correctly.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('NO')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the overall logic and structure of the program. However, there are minor issues with the implementation of the operations. Once these issues are fixed, the program will correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

**Final: True**
