Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: 
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1):` will start from `i = 1` and go up to `i = n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range `[1, n-2]`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be initialized to `1` and `n` should be greater than or equal to `3` (since `3 <= n`).

Given the initial state:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers representing the array `a`.
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can start executing.

**State:**
- `i` is `1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `3`

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
