Output State: **`i` is 1, `list[0]` must be less than or equal to -1, `list[1]` is `-3 * list[0]`, `list[2]` is `list[2] - list[0]`, `list[3]` is `-3 * list[0] - 1`, `list[2]` is decreased by `list[0]`**

Explanation: The code updates `list[i]` by subtracting `2 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `i` is 1, `list[i]` refers to `list[1]`. So, `list[1]` is updated to `list[1] - 2 * list[0]`. Since `list[1]` was initially `-3 * list[0]`, after the operation, `list[1]` becomes `-3 * list[0] - 2 * list[0] = -5 * list[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
