Output State: **`i` is 1, `list[0]` must be greater than 0, `list[1]` is decreased by `list[0]`, `list[2]` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` updates `list[1]` (since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2 and `i - 1` is 0) by subtracting `list[0]` from it. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
