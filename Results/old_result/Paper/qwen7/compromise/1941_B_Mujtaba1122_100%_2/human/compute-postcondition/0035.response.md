Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides us with the following information:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `list[2]` is 0 or less.
   - `list[1]` is 0.
   - `list[3]` is 0.
   - `list[i - 1]` is not 0.

2. We need to determine the value of `list[i - 1]`:
   - Since `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1.
   - From the initial state, we know that `list[1]` is 0.

3. The `print('no')` statement will simply print the string 'no'.

Output: **no**
