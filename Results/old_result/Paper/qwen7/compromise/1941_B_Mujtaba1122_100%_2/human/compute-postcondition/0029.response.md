Output State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1` and must be greater than `2 * list[1] + 2`; `list[1]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is greater than 0; `list[i + 1]` (which is `list[3]`) is decreased by `1 * list[i - 1]` (which is `list[1]`), so `list[3]` is now `list[3] - list[1]`**

In simpler terms: `i` remains 2, `list[2]` remains as `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1` and must still be greater than `2 * list[1] + 2`, `list[1]` remains greater than 0, `list[3]` remains greater than 0, and `list[3]` is now reduced by the value of `list[1]`.
