Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `list[3]` must be greater than 1, `list[2]` must be greater than 0, `list[4]` must be greater than 0, `list[4]` is decreased by `list[2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `list[i + 1]` (which is `list[4]`) by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` (which is `list[2]`). Therefore, `list[4]` is decreased by the value of `list[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
