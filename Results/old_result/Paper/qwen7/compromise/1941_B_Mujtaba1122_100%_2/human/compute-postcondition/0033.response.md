Output State: `i` is 2; `list[2]` is less than or equal to 0; `list[1]` is 0; `list[3]` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 2 because the condition `list[i] > 1` will eventually fail when `list[2]` becomes less than or equal to 0. The value of `list[2]` keeps decreasing by `2 * list[1]` each iteration until it reaches 0 or below. Since `list[1]` is decremented by `list[1]` each iteration, it will eventually reach 0 as well. Similarly, `list[3]` is decremented by `list[1]` each iteration, so it will also reach 0. Therefore, the final state of the list is such that `list[2]`, `list[1]`, and `list[3]` are all 0 or less, with `list[2]` being the last to reach 0 or below.
