The function accepts an integer `n` and calculates the last element of a list `dp` based on a specific recurrence relation. The list `dp` is initialized with the first two elements as 1 and 3. For each integer `i` from 2 to `n`, the next element in `dp` is computed using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`. After all iterations, the function returns the last element of the list `dp`.
