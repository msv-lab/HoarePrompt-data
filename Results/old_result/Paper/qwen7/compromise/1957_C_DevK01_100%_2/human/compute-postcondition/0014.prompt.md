You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n; for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the moves are valid according to the problem description.
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n + 1`. After all iterations, `dp` will contain `n - 1` elements. Each element in `dp` will be calculated based on the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)` for `i` from 2 to `n`, with the first two elements being 1.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, `dp` will look like this:
    #- `dp[0]` will be 1,
    #- `dp[1]` will be 3 (since the second element is calculated as `(dp[0] + 2 * 1 * 0) % (7 + 10^9) = 1 + 0 = 1`, but the loop starts from index 1),
    #- Each subsequent element will follow the given recurrence relation.
    #
    #The final state of `dp` will be a list of length `n - 1`, with each element computed based on the previous two elements modulo \(7 \times 10^9 + 7\).
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `dp` which is calculated based on the recurrence relation `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)` for `i` from 2 to `n`, starting with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 3`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `n`, and returns the last element of the list `dp` which is calculated based on the recurrence relation `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)` for `i` from 2 to `n`, starting with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 3`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list `dp` which is calculated based on the recurrence relation `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)` for `i` from 2 to `n`, starting with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 3`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
