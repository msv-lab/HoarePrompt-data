Output State: **`i` is 2; `dp` is a list containing one element which is `(dp[-1] + 2 * (2 - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`**

Explanation: The initial state is that `i` is 2. The code updates the list `dp` by adding a new element. This new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Since `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(dp[-1] + 2 * (2 - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, which further simplifies to `(dp[-1] + 2 * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. However, without knowing the initial values of `dp[-1]` and `dp[-2]`, we cannot simplify this expression further. Thus, the updated state of `dp` is a list with one element as described.
