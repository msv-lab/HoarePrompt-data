The function accepts a list `p` of integers (sorted in ascending order) and an integer `x` within the range of 1 to the maximum value in `p`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `p`, it returns the length of the list `p`. Otherwise, it performs a binary search to find the position where `x` would fit in the sorted list `p` and returns the midpoint value `mid` used in the binary search process during the last iteration of the loop.
