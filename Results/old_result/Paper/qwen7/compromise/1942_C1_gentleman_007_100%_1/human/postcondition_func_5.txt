The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. It creates a 2D list `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1) and sets specific elements to 1 based on the output of `func_1()` called three times. After the function completes, it returns the 2D list `l`. The variable `i` is set to 2, and `m` must be at least 3.
