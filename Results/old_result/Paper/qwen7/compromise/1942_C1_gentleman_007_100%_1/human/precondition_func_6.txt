l is a list of integers where each integer represents a vertex chosen by Bessie. The length of l is x, and 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5). The integers in l are distinct and within the range 1 to n, where n is the number of sides of the polygon and 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Additionally, y = 0, meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.
