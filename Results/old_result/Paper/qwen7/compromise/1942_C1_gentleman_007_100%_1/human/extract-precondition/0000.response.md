The provided function `func_25` does not seem to directly relate to the problem description or the variables in the main problem's input and output. It appears to be a separate function that performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph, marking nodes as visited and printing their values. However, based on the problem description, we need to focus on the variables and their relationships in the context of the problem.

Given the problem description, let's extract the precondition based on the variables in the function signature and the problem statement.

### Precondition
**Precondition:** **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, **n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**, representing the number of sides of the polygon; **x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5)**, representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen; and **y is an integer such that y = 0**, representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen. Additionally, the input guarantees that the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The input also includes a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
