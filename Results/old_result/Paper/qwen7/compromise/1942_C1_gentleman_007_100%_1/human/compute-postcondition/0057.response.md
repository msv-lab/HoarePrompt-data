Output State: **`q` now contains the original elements plus the first element in `graph[ver]` and the node `node`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is set to the second element in `graph[ver]`, and the node `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is now 1)**.

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the value of `node` to the list `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `q` now includes the original elements plus the first element in `graph[ver]` (since `node` was set to the second element in `graph[ver]`), `graph[ver]` still contains at least one element, `node` is set to the second element in `graph[ver]`, and the node `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is now 1).
