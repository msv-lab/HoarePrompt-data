Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the first element in `q` (after applying `popleft()`), all nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited, and `q` contains the remaining elements (if any) after removing the first element.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `q` now contains the original elements plus `node`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is set to the first element in `graph[ver]`, and the node `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is now 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `q` now contains the original elements plus the first element in `graph[ver]` and the node `node`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is set to the second element in `graph[ver]`, and the node `node` has now been visited (`vis[node]` is now 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `q` now contains the original elements plus the first element in `graph[ver]` and the third element in `graph[ver]`, and `vis[node]` is now 1. If `vis[node]` is not already 1 (i.e., `node` has not been visited), then `node` is added to `q`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
