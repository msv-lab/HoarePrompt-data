Output State: **All nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited, and `q` is empty.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every node that is reachable from the starting node `ver` will have had `vis[node]` set to `True`. This means that all reachable nodes have been visited. Additionally, since each node is added to `q` and then removed once its neighbors have been processed, and given that the loop continues only as long as there are unvisited neighbors, `q` will eventually become empty when all reachable nodes have been visited.
