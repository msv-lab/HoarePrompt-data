Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decremented by 3, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is now a list containing `a[i]`, and if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, then no change is made to `i` and `j`. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i]` to the list `l`. Since `i` was a non-zero integer decremented by 2 initially, decrementing `i` by 1 further makes it a non-zero integer decremented by 3. The value of `j` remains unchanged as `len(b) - 1`. The list `l` now contains `a[i]`. The conditions related to the `dp` matrix and the comparison between `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]` remain the same.
