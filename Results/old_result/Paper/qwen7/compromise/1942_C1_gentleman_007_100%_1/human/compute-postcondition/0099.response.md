Output State: `i` is `0`, `j` is `len(b)`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing elements from `a` up to the point where the loop terminates. After the loop completes, `i` will be decremented to `0` because the loop continues as long as `i` and `j` are non-zero. Since the loop exits when both `i` and `j` become zero or negative, `i` will reach `0` and `j` will remain `len(b)` as it is decremented only when `dp[i][j]` does not equal `dp[i][j - 1]`, and once `i` reaches `0`, the condition `i != 0` fails, causing the loop to exit.
