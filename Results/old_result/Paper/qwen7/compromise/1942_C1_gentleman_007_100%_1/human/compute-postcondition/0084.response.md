Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decremented by 2, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`, and if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, then no change is made to `i` and `j`. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was initially `len(b)`, after decrementing, `j` becomes `len(b) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
