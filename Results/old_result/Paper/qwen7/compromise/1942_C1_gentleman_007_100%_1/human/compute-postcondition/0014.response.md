Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element from `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is True, and `q` contains the node**.

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. The `node` is the next element from `graph[ver]`, and `vis[node]` is True (as per the initial state). All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
