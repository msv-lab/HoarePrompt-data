Based on the initial state provided:

- `ver` is the first element in the deque `q`.
- `q` is updated to remove the first element, meaning `q` no longer contains `ver`.
- All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` through the graph's edges have been visited (i.e., `vis[node] == 1` for all such nodes).

The `print(ver, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `ver` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **ver (where ver is the first element in the deque q)**
