Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by cutting the cake using the given vertices. The key insight is that a polygon with \( n \) sides can be divided into \( n-2 \) triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the input and processes it in a straightforward manner.
   - It sorts the chosen vertices and checks for consecutive vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

3. **Key Function Analysis**:
   - **func_2**: Reads and returns a list of chosen vertices.
   - The main logic is implemented in the loop where it checks for consecutive vertices and increments the count of triangles accordingly.

4. **Execution Flow**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and then the chosen vertices.
   - It sorts the chosen vertices and checks for consecutive vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The code correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of triangles by checking for consecutive vertices.
   - There are no unnecessary or incorrect operations that would lead to an incorrect solution.
   - The constraints and input handling are appropriately managed.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
