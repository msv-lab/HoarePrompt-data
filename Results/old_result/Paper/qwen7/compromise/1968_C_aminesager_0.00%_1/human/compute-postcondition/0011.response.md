Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[1] - T[1]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, so `n` must remain greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

5. **State of `a`**: The value of `a` is not directly affected by the loop head variables, so we do not need to adjust its state for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
