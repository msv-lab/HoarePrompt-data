Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the list `a` is `[1000 - sum(T), 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), ..., 1000 - sum(T)]` reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Initially, the list `a` was constructed such that `a[j] = 1000 - sum(T[0:j])` for each `j` in the range of `n`. After reversing the list, the first element of the new list `a` will be `1000 - sum(T)`, the second element will be `1000 - (T[0] + T[1])`, and so on, until the last element which will be `1000 - T[0]`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
