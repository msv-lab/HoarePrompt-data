Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than the input integer, `a` is a list where the first element `a[0]` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`, and every subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-2`) is `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The list `a` will contain `n` elements, starting with `1000` and each subsequent element will be derived by subtracting the corresponding value from `T` from the previous element in the list.
