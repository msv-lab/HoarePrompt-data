Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than the input integer
   - `a` is a list with one element, and `a[0] = a[-1] - T[-1]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than the input integer.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than the input integer.

6. **List `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head variables**.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than the input integer**
