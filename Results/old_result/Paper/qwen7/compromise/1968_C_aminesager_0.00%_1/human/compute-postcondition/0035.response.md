Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop continues as long as the variable `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

2. **Identify Relevant States**: From the given information, the relevant states are:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` must be greater than the input integer
   - `a` is a list with specific values based on the input `T`
   - `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**: Since the loop condition is `while t`, the only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes one more time is `t`. We need to ensure `t` is truthy.

Given that no specific value for `t` is mentioned in the current state, we can assume that `t` was set to some value before the loop started. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than the input integer, `a` is a list where the first element `a[0]` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`, and every subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-2`) is `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`, and the list `a` is reversed; `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces; `t` must be non-zero**
