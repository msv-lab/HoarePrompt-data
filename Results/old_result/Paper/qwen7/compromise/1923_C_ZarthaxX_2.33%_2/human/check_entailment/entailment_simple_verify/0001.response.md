### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray \(c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, \dots, c_{r_i}\) is "good".
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array \(b\) of the same length such that:
     1. The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
     2. No element in \(a\) is equal to the corresponding element in \(b\).
     3. All elements in \(b\) are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the subarray contains only 1s, it cannot be good because we cannot find another array \(b\) where all elements are positive and different from the original.
   - For a subarray to be good, it must contain at least one element greater than 1. This allows us to create a new array \(b\) where we replace some 1s with other positive numbers while keeping the sum the same.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process each test case.
   - It calculates the number of 1s (`ones`) and the adjusted sum (`sum`) up to each index.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray can be good by comparing the number of 1s and the adjusted sum within the specified range.

4. **Specific Issues**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be checking if the subarray can be good by comparing the number of 1s and the adjusted sum. However, the logic is flawed.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not correctly determine if the subarray can be good. Instead, it should check if the subarray has enough flexibility to replace some 1s with other positive numbers without violating the conditions.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly determine if a subarray is good, we need to check if the subarray contains at least one element greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray is even (since we can pair elements to make them different).

6. **Corrected Logic**:
   - Check if the subarray contains at least one element greater than 1.
   - Check if the sum of the subarray is even.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Initialization**:
  - The function initializes `ones` and `sum` lists to keep track of the cumulative counts and sums.
  - These calculations are correct and necessary for determining the number of 1s and the adjusted sum.

- **Query Processing**:
  - The function processes each query by calculating `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`.
  - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray can be good.
  - This condition is incorrect because it does not properly account for the requirement that no element in \(b\) can be equal to the corresponding element in \(a\).

### Corrected Condition:

To correctly determine if a subarray is good, we need to check:
1. If the subarray contains at least one element greater than 1.
2. If the sum of the subarray is even.

The corrected condition would be:
```python
if any(nums[i-1] > 1 for i in range(l, r+1)) and (sumInRange % 2 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified that the given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good. The provided annotated code confirms that the logic used in the program is indeed incorrect.

**Final: False**
