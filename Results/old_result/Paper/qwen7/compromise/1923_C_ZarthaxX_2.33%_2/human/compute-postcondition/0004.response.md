Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive).
3. **Check the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `1`, `i` must be `1` at the beginning of the loop.
4. **Check the condition for the loop to run**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1**
