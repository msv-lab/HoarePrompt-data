You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where each element starting from index 1 is the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where each element starting from index 1 is the cumulative sum of `nums` up to that index minus the index value.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where each element starting from index 1 is the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where each element starting from index 1 is the cumulative sum of `nums` up to that index minus the index value, `q` is decremented after each iteration of the loop, `l` and `r` are updated with values read from input for each iteration of the loop, `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are recalculated for each iteration based on the current values of `l` and `r`. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition given for each pair of `l` and `r`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two positive integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function returns the result of processing these inputs, which could be a list of answers for each query or a specific value based on the problem's requirements.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
