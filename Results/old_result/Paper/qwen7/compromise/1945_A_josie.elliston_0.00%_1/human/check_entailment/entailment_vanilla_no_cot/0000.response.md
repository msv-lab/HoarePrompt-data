Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all the constraints and edge cases specified in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Introverts and Extroverts Together**: The function `func_2` only considers the accommodation for extroverts and universals but does not account for the introverts. Specifically, it does not ensure that each introvert gets a separate tent.

2. **Calculation for Extroverts and Universals**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals but does not consider the minimum number of tents needed for introverts. It should add the number of tents required for introverts directly.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to accommodate everyone, such as when the number of extroverts is more than twice the number of universals plus one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals
    # Each tent can have either 2 extroverts or 1 extrovert and 2 universals
    tents_needed = ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    return tents_needed

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for introverts
    tents_for_introverts = introverts
    
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals
    tents_for_others = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    
    # Total tents needed
    total_tents = tents_for_introverts + tents_for_others
    
    # Check if it's possible to accommodate everyone
    if extroverts > 2 * universals + 1:
        return -1
    
    return total_tents

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().strip().split())
        print(func_2(a, b, c))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the accommodation needs for both introverts and extroverts and universals, and it checks for the possibility of accommodating everyone before returning the result.
