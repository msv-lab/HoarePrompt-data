You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts three parameters (`introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`) and returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of calling `func_1(extroverts, universals)`. If `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`, the function returns `-1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`

1. **Purpose**: This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
2. **Logic**:
   - If the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is not divisible by 3, check if adding the number of universals (`universals`) makes the total divisible by 3.
     - If `extroverts % 3` plus `universals` is less than 3, it means there are not enough universals to make the group of extroverts complete (i.e., 3 people per tent).
       - In this case, return `None`.
     - Otherwise, return the ceiling of the division of the sum of extroverts and universals by 3.

#### Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`

1. **Purpose**: This function calculates the total number of tents required for all participants.
2. **Logic**:
   - Call `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals together, so return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, add the number of introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents.

### Testing the Logic

Let's test the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
   - `func_1(2, 3)`: 
     - `2 % 3 = 2`, and `2 + 3 = 5`, which is divisible by 3.
     - Return `ceil(5 / 3) = 2`.
   - Total tents: `1 (for introvert) + 2 = 3`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
   - `func_1(4, 1)`: 
     - `4 % 3 = 1`, and `1 + 1 = 2`, which is less than 3.
     - Return `None`.
   - Total tents: `-1`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 4 2`
   - `func_1(4, 2)`: 
     - `4 % 3 = 1`, and `1 + 2 = 3`, which is divisible by 3.
     - Return `ceil(3 / 3) = 1`.
   - Total tents: `1 (for introvert) + 1 = 2`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 1`
   - `func_1(1, 1)`: 
     - `1 % 3 = 1`, and `1 + 1 = 2`, which is less than 3.
     - Return `None`.
   - Total tents: `-1`.

5. **Test Case 5**: `1 3 2`
   - `func_1(3, 2)`: 
     - `3 % 3 = 0`, and `0 + 2 = 2`, which is less than 3.
     - Return `None`.
   - Total tents: `-1`.

6. **Test Case 6**: `19 7 18`
   - `func_1(7, 18)`: 
     - `7 % 3 = 1`, and `1 + 18 = 19`, which is divisible by 3.
     - Return `ceil(19 / 3) = 7`.
   - Total tents: `19 (for introverts) + 7 = 26`.

7. **Test Case 7**: `0 0 0`
   - `func_1(0, 0)`: 
     - Return `0`.
   - Total tents: `0`.

8. **Test Case 8**: `7 0 0`
   - `func_1(0, 0)`: 
     - Return `0`.
   - Total tents: `7 (for introverts) + 0 = 7`.

9. **Test Case 9**: `0 24 0`
   - `func_1(24, 0)`: 
     - `24 % 3 = 0`, and `0 + 0 = 0`, which is divisible by 3.
     - Return `ceil(24 / 3) = 8`.
   - Total tents: `0 (for introverts) + 8 = 8`.

10. **Test Case 10**: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
    - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)`: 
      - `1000000000 % 3 = 1`, and `1 + 1000000000 = 1000000001`, which is divisible by 3.
      - Return `ceil(1000000001 / 3) = 333333334`.
    - Total tents: `1000000000 (for introverts) + 333333334 = 1333333334`.
