Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is divisible by 3.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it further checks if `(extroverts % 3 + universals) >= 3`. If this condition holds, it means that the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete groups of 3, and thus, it returns the minimum number of tents required using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
   - If the above condition is not met, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to their preferences.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid number of tents, `func_2` adds the number of introverts (`introverts`) to this value to account for their individual tent requirements.

3. **Program Execution**:
   - The annotated program processes each line of input, splits the values into `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, and calls `func_2` with these values.
   - The results are printed out, which matches the expected output from the example provided.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented in the functions, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or returns `-1` when it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.

Correctness: **True**
