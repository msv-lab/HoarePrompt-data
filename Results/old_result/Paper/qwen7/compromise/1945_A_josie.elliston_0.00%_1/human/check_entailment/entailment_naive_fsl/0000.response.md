Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and no additional universals available. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
1 4 1
```

Here, there is 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, and 1 universal. According to the problem description, the extroverts should be paired with universals and another extrovert. However, since there is only 1 universal, it is impossible to pair all 4 extroverts as required. The program should return `-1` in this case, but it returns `3`, which is incorrect.
