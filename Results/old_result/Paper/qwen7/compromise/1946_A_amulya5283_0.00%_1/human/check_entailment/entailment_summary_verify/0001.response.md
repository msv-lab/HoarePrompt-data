### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for handling large inputs.

2. **Test Cases Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses each test case, extracting the size of the array and the array itself. The test cases are stored in a list of tuples, which is a good way to manage multiple test cases.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The parsed test cases are passed to the function `func_1`, which is supposed to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of each array.

4. **Median Calculation**:
   - The program sorts the array to find the median.
   - It calculates the median index correctly as `median_index = n // 2`.
   - However, the program incorrectly assumes that the median is always at the exact middle index when `n` is odd. For even `n`, the median should be the average of the two middle elements, but the program only considers the element at `median_index`.

5. **Heap Usage**:
   - A min-heap is used starting from the middle of the sorted array.
   - The program increments the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median value.
   - This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility that the median might be the average of two elements in the case of an even-sized array.

6. **Operations Count**:
   - The program counts the number of operations needed to make the smallest element in the heap greater than the current median.
   - This approach is overly simplistic and doesn't handle the case where the median is the average of two elements.

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment is correct. The program indeed has issues with calculating the median correctly, especially for even-sized arrays, and the use of a min-heap to increment elements until the smallest element in the second half is greater than the median is not appropriate. 

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
