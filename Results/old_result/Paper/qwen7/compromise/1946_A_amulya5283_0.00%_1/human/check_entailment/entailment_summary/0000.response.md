Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads and parses the input from standard input. It handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all the data at once and splitting it into individual test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sorting and Median Calculation**: The program sorts the array and calculates the median index correctly. This part is essential for determining which elements need to be incremented.
   - **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap to keep track of the elements in the second half of the array after the median. This is a good approach to ensure that the smallest element in the second half is incremented until it is greater than the median.
   - **Increment Logic**: The logic to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median is implemented correctly. This ensures that the median is increased with the minimum number of operations.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the results for each test case correctly, following the specified format.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and performs the required operations correctly.

Correctness: **True**
