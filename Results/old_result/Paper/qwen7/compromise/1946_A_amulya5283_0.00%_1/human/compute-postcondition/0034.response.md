Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap - 1], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 2, `operations` is 2, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `smallest + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap. Since the heap was initially a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `smallest`, after pushing `smallest + 1`, the smallest element in the heap changes to `smallest + 1`. The value of `smallest` is updated to the second smallest element from the original heap because the smallest element has been pushed out of the way. The other variables remain unchanged except for `i` which is incremented by 1, making it greater than or equal to the number of elements in the heap plus 2. The `operations` count is also incremented to 2.
