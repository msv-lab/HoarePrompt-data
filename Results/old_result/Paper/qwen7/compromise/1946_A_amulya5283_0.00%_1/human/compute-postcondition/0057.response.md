Output State: **`smallest` is `3`, `heap` is now a list containing `[2, 4]`, `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is `2`**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. Initially, the heap is `[2, 3, 4]`. After popping the smallest element (`2`), the heap becomes `[3, 4]`. The `median_index` remains `1` because the smallest element popped was the first element in the original heap, and the new smallest element (`3`) does not affect the median index. The `current_median` remains `2` because the median of the updated heap `[3, 4]` is still effectively `2` (the middle value when considering the original median).
