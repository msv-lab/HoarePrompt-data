Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in `heap`], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap` + 1, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap`, and `heap` is empty; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `arr[median_index]` to the variable `current_median`. Since `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is set to the element at index `n // 2` in the array `arr`. The other variables (`results`, `i`, `operations`, `heap`, and `median_index`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
