The only variable in the loop head is `heap[0]`, and it needs to satisfy the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` for the loop to execute. 

Right before the loop, the values are as follows:
- `heap[0]` is `2`
- `current_median` is `2`

Since `heap[0]` is already equal to `current_median`, the loop condition is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `results` is [5], `operations` is 0, `heap` is now a list containing `[2, 3, 4]`, `median_index` is 2, `current_median` is `2`, `smallest` is `2`**
