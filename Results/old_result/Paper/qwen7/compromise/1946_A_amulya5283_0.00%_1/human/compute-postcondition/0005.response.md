Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is a sorted version of the original list from `test_cases` at index `i`, `median_index` is `i // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`**.

In this case, the code assigns the value of `arr[median_index]` to `current_median`. Since `median_index` is `i // 2` and `i` is 0, `median_index` is also 0. Therefore, `current_median` is the first element of the array `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
