Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `results` is [5], `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `[1, 2, 3, 4]` with the smallest element being `1`, `median_index` is 2, `current_median` is `1`, `smallest` is `1**.

Explanation: The line `median_index = n // 2` calculates the floor division of `n` (which is 5) by 2, resulting in `median_index` being set to 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
