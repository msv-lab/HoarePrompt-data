Output State: `smallest` is 5, `heap` is now a list containing [5, 5, 5], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 5, `operations` is increased by 3.

Explanation: After the first 3 iterations, the `smallest` value is 5, and the heap contains [4, 5, 5]. The loop continues to execute until the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` no longer holds true. Since `heap[0]` is 4 and `current_median` is 5, the loop will continue. However, when `smallest` becomes 5 (after popping 5 from the heap), the next operation will push 6 into the heap, making it [5, 5, 6]. The loop then checks the condition again with `heap[0]` as 5 and `current_median` as 5, and since `heap[0]` is still less than or equal to `current_median`, another iteration occurs. In this iteration, `smallest` is 5, and after pushing 6, the heap becomes [5, 6, 6]. Now, `heap[0]` is 5 but the next operation will push 7 into the heap, making it [6, 6, 7]. At this point, `heap[0]` is 6 which is greater than `current_median` (which is 5), so the loop terminates. Therefore, the final state of the variables is as described.
