Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in `heap`], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap` + 1, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap`, and `heap` is empty; `median_index` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `median_index` as `n // 2`, where `n` is the number of elements in `heap`. Since `heap` is empty, `n` is 0, and thus `median_index` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
