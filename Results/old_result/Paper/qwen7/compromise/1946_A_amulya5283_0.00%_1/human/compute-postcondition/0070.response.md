Output State: **`smallest` is 7, `heap` is [5, 5, 7], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 5, `operations` is increased by 4, `results` is a list containing 3.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `operations` to the `results` list. Given the initial state and the description of the loop's behavior, the loop ran one more time, increasing `smallest` to 7, updating the `heap` to [5, 5, 7], and keeping `median_index` and `current_median` unchanged. `operations` increased by 1, making it 4 in total. The `results` list now contains the values 3 from the previous iterations and 4 from the final iteration.
