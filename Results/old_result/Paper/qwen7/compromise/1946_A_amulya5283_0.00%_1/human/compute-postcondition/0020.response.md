Output State: **`smallest` is now the new value of the smallest element in `heap` + 1; `smallest` is `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`; `results` is an empty list; `i` is 1; `operations` is 3.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Initially, `operations` was 2, so after this line, `operations` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
