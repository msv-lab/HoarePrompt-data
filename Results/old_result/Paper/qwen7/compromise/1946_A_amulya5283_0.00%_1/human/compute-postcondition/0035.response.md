Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap - 1], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 3, `operations` is 3, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `smallest + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap.**

Explanation: The variable `operations` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
