Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `results` is [5], `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a list containing `[2, 3, 4]`, `median_index` is 2, `current_median` is `2`, `smallest` is `2**.

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a heap in-place. Given the initial `heap` is `[2, 3, 4]`, after calling `heapify`, the heap property is maintained, meaning the smallest element (2) is at the root. All other elements satisfy the heap condition relative to their parent. Therefore, the heap remains `[2, 3, 4]`. All other variables are not affected by this operation.
