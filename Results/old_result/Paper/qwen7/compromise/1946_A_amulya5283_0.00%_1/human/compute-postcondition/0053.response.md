Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `results` is [5], `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a list containing `[2, 3, 4]`, `median_index` is 2, `current_median` is `2`, `smallest` is `2**.

Explanation: The line `heap = arr[median_index:]` slices the list `arr` starting from the index `median_index` (which is 2) to the end. This results in a new list `[2, 3, 4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
