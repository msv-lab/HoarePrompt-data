Output State: The `results` list will contain the total number of operations required for all test cases, which is the sum of `operations` for each test case. The `i` variable will be equal to the total number of test cases since the loop has completed all its iterations. The `heap` will be empty after processing all test cases. The `operations` variable will hold the cumulative count of operations performed across all test cases. The `median_index` and `current_median` will be updated according to the last test case processed, but these values will not affect the final state of `results`.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the `results` list will contain the total number of operations required to process all test cases. The `i` variable will be equal to the total number of test cases. The `heap` will be empty as it has been emptied after processing all elements in the last test case. The `operations` variable will hold the cumulative count of operations performed across all test cases. The `median_index` and `current_median` will reflect the state of the last test case processed, but they do not affect the final state of the `results` list.
