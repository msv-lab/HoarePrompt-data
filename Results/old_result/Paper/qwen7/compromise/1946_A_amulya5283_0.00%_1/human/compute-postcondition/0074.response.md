Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers representing the array `a`. The function returns a list containing the total number of operations performed across all test cases, the total number of test cases, the sum of operations performed for each test case, and an empty heap.**
