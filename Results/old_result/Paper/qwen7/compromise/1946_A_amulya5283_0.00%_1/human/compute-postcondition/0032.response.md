Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `heap[0] <= current_median`.

2. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `results` is `[number of elements in heap]`.
   - `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap` + 1.
   - `operations` is 0.
   - `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index:]`.
   - `median_index` is `n // 2`.
   - `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute if `heap[0] <= current_median`.
   - Currently, `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap` + 1, which means `i` is greater than the size of the heap. This doesn't directly affect the loop condition.
   - `operations` being 0 doesn't affect the loop condition either.
   - The key variables here are `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the min-heap, and `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, the loop will execute if `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.
   - Given that `heap` is a min-heap containing `arr[median_index:]`, the smallest element in `heap` should be less than or equal to `current_median` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to the given states because the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is already satisfied based on the provided information.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 1, `operations` is 0, and `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index:]`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`**
