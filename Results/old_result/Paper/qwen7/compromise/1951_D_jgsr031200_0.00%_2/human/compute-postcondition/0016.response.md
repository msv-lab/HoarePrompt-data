Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs`, ignoring the last element (which is always 1).
   - `n` is 0.
   - The current value of `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Calculating `costs`:**
   - Since `n` is 0, the first element of `costs` is `0 - k + 1 = 1 - k`.
   - Therefore, `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`.

3. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs`, ignoring the last element.
   - Since `n` is 0, `0 / (1 - k)` is 0 (assuming `1 - k` is not zero).
   - Therefore, `h` is `0 + 0 = 0`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The problem states that the current value of `h` is less than `k`.
   - Since `h` is 0, this condition is true if `k > 0`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given the above steps, the print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
