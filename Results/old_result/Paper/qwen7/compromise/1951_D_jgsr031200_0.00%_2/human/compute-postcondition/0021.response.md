Postcondition: `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs` (ignoring the last element since it's always 1), `n` is 0, and if `h` is less than `k`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function continues with the condition that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
