You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns the value of n (or k, since they are equal), which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is greater than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs` (ignoring the last element since it's always 1), `n` is 0.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: 1 1
    #State: Postcondition: `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs` (ignoring the last element since it's always 1), `n` is 0, and if `h` is less than `k`, the function does not change `h`. Otherwise, `h` is adjusted based on the condition being true or false.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. It returns the value of n (or k, since they are equal) if it falls within the specified range; otherwise, it returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of n (or k, since they are equal), which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18.

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
