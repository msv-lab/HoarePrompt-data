### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall in sequence until she runs out of coins or cannot afford any more jewels.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is supposed to determine if it's possible to achieve exactly `k` jewels and, if so, output the necessary details.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it directly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, which is correct because Alice would buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is 1 coin.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy even one jewel.
   - Otherwise, it initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and 1. These values are used to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
   - It then calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) using these prices.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given prices.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls (2 in this case), and the prices for the stalls.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling the special case when `n == k` is correct.
   - The logic for checking if `n < k` is also correct.
   - However, the logic for calculating the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall and the total number of jewels is flawed. Specifically, the current implementation only considers two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1. This is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios where Alice might need to buy exactly `k` jewels using up to 60 stalls.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the example provided in the problem statement, the third test case (`255 8`) should be handled correctly. However, the current implementation only considers two stalls, which is insufficient to ensure that Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. The correct approach would involve dynamically setting the prices for up to 60 stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. While it handles some edge cases correctly, it fails to consider the full range of possible scenarios where Alice might need to buy exactly `k` jewels using up to 60 stalls.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
