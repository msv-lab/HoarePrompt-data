Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the scenario where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up the appropriate number of stalls with the correct prices.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Prices**: The program tries to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. However, this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, consider the following test case:
   - Input: `n = 10`, `k = 7`
   - Expected Output: `YES` followed by the number of stalls and their prices.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 7`:
     - The program sets up two stalls with prices `[4, 1]`.
     - Alice will buy 4 jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling 5 jewels, which is not equal to `k`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up stalls with specific prices.
   - A correct approach would involve setting up stalls such that the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall equals `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Determine the number of stalls needed
    stalls = []
    current_jewels = k
    for i in range(1, min(k + 1, 61)):
        if current_jewels >= i:
            stalls.append(i)
            current_jewels -= i

    if current_jewels == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected program ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the necessary number of stalls with the correct prices.
