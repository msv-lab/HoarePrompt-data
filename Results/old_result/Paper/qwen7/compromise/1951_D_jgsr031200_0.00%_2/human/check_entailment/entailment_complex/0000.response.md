### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` equals `k`, it prints "YES" three times and returns `n`.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and returns `None`.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of `n` divided by each value in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and stores it in `h`.
     - The first element of the list is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.
     - The sum `h` is calculated as `h = (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n // 1)`.
     - Since `n // 1` is always `n`, `h` simplifies to `h = (n // (n - k + 1)) + n`.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", "2", and the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

2. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1**: `n == k`
     - The function correctly prints "YES" three times and returns `n`.
   - **Case 2**: `n < k`
     - The function correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 3**: `n >= k`
     - The function calculates `h` as `h = (n // (n - k + 1)) + n`.
     - For `h` to be at least `k`, `(n // (n - k + 1)) + n` must be at least `k`.
       - Simplifying, we get `(n // (n - k + 1)) + n >= k`.
       - Since `n // (n - k + 1)` is at least `1` (as `n` is at least `k`), the condition holds true.
     - The function prints "YES", "2", and `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which are valid prices for the stalls.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n == k`, the function correctly prints "YES" three times.
   - When `n < k`, the function correctly prints "NO".
   - When `n >= k`, the function correctly prints "YES" and the appropriate number of stalls with valid prices.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly handles all the given conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
