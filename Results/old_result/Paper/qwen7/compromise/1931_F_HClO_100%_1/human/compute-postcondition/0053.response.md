Output State: **`idx1` is `-1` or `i`, `idx2` is `-1` or `i`, `p1` is `1` or `0`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `n` is greater than `1`, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to `0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, or the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is in. All other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.
