Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, or if it does, the loop breaks.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1):
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, these are the only variables that can be adjusted.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless the loop breaks due to the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, but since this condition is not specified to change `n`, `n` stays the same.

5. **Final States:**
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
