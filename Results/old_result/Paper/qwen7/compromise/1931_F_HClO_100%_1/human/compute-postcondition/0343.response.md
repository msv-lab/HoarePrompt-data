Output State: **`m` is 2, `n` is an unspecified integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `a2` is the second integer input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding elements equal to `a1`. We continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific changes are made to the variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state includes all the variables from the initial state, indicating that the process continues without altering the existing values.
