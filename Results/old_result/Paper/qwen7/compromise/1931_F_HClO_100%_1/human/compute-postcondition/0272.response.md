Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, and the list `l` is the same as `l1` with an element inserted at index `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` simply assigns the reference of `l1` to `l`. It does not create a new list but rather makes `l` point to the same list that `l1` points to. Therefore, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, and `p2` remain unchanged, and the list `l` now refers to the same list as `l1`, which has an element inserted at index `n - 2`.
