Output State: **`t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` remains as the original input integer, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, and `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

The code initializes two variables `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. This does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables or their values. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except for the new values of `idx1` and `idx2`.
