Output State: **`t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, and we continue the loop or iteration we were inside.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `t`, `val`, and `n` remain unchanged. The output state includes the fact that the loop or iteration continues.
