Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `m` will be greater than 2, `a3` will hold the first integer from each of the `m-2` inputs provided, `l3` will be a list of the remaining integers from each of these inputs, all converted to integers, and `val` will be a list containing `m-2` tuples, with each tuple consisting of an `a3` and corresponding `l3`.

In more detail, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `m` will retain its value indicating that the loop ran `m-2` times.
- `a3` will store the first integer from each of the `m-2` inputs.
- `l3` will contain the remaining integers from each of these inputs, excluding the first integer, all converted to integers.
- `val` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding `a3` and `l3` for each of the `m-2` inputs.

If at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` evaluates to `False` for any iteration, the loop will break and print 'no' instead of continuing to the next iteration or completing the final 'else' block which would print 'yes'.
