Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` in the `val` list. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `a3`, `l3`, and the corresponding tuple in `val`.

2. **Understand the Condition**: The postcondition states that if the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that excludes all elements of `a3` from `l`, then the condition remains as is. This means that if the condition is not met, the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `_` do not change.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**: Since there is no operation specified in the else part that changes the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `_`, these values remain the same for the next iteration. The only thing that might change is the tuple `(a3, l3)` in the `val` list, but since the condition remains as is, the tuple itself does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), and `_` is 0 or 1**.
