Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `idx2` is equal to the new value of `i`; `p2` is 1.**

The value of `p2` is set to 1, but the exact value of `i` and `idx2` remains unspecified since the increment operation on `i` does not provide a concrete numerical value. However, it is clear that `idx2` is updated to the new value of `i`.
