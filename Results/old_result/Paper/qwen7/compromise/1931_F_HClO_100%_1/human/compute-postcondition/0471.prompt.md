Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `val` is either an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, and `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers. Additionally, if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, the element at index `idx1` in `l` is updated with `a2`; otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, the element at index `idx2` in `l1` is updated with `a1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be at least 2, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 1; `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int; `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input converted to int; `val` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
