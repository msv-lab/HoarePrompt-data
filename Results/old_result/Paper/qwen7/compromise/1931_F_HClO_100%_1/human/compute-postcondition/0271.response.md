Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, and the list `l1` has an element inserted at index `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`, which is `n - 2`. The values of `idx1` and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `idx1` is greater than `idx2` is no longer applicable since both `idx1` and `idx2` now have the same value.
