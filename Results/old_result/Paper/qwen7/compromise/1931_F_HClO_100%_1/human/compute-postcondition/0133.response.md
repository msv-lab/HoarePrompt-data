Postcondition: `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2`, `m` equals 2, the list `val` is updated with integers from the input, and `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list while `l3` contains the rest of the elements; either `a1` is inserted at index `idx2` in `l1` and `l` references `l1`, or `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in `l2` and `l` is assigned the value of `l2` after ensuring `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`.
