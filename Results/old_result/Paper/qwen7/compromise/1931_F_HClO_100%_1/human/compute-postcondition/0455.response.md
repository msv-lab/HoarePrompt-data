Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `m` equals 2, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` with `idx1` being less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
