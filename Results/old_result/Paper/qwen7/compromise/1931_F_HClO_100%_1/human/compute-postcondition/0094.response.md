Output State: `idx1` is `-1` or any value it was set to during the loop, `idx2` is `-1` or any value it was set to during the loop, `p1` is `1` or `0`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than `n-2`, and either both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to `0` (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is met and we break out of the loop or if statement.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop runs from `i=0` to `i=n-2`. At the end of the loop, `i` will be `n-2`. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` will be the last values they were assigned within the loop, and `p1` and `p2` will retain their last assigned values of `1` or `0`. The conditions for breaking out of the loop (either `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`) would have caused the loop to terminate before reaching `i=n-2` if those conditions were met earlier.
