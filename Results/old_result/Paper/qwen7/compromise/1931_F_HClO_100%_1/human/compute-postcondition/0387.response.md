Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `idx2` is 1**.

The code assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `idx2`. Since the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is not relevant to this assignment, the preconditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` is still greater than or equal to 1, and `idx2` is now also 1.
