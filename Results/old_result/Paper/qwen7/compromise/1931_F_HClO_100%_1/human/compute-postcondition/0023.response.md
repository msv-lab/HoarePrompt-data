Output State: **All inputs have been taken, and the loop has completed its iterations.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since the initial state already mentions that all inputs have been taken and the loop has completed its iterations, the `continue` statement does not change this state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
