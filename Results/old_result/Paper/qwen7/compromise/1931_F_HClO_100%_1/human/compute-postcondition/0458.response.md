Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `val` is either an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, and `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers. Additionally, if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, the element at index `idx2` in `l1` is updated with `a1`.
