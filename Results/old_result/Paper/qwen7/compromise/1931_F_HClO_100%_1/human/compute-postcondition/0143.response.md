Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 2; `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input starting from the second element; `val` is a list containing one tuple, the first element of which is `a3` and the second element is `l3`.**

The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `m` and `a3` remain unchanged, and `l3` remains a list of integers starting from the second element of the input. The new list `val` contains the appended tuple.
