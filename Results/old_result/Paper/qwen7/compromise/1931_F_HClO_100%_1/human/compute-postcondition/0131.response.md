Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2`, `m` equals 2, the list `val` is updated with integers from the input, and `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list while `l3` contains the rest of the elements. `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`**.

Explanation: The code inserts `a2` into the list `l2` at the index `idx1`. Since `idx1` is `n - 2`, `a2` is inserted at the position `n - 2` in `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
