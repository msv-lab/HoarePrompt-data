Output State: idx1 is n - 2, idx2 is n - 2, p2 is 1, m is less than or equal to 2, a3 is a list of integers entered during the loop executions, l3 is a list of lists of integers entered during the loop executions, val is a list containing m-2 tuples of the form (a3[i], l3[i]) for i in range(m-2), and _ is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `idx1` and `idx2` remain at `n - 2` because they are not modified within the loop. The variable `p2` remains 1 as it is also not modified. The variable `m` will be reduced to 2 or less after executing `m-2` times. The variable `a3` accumulates a list of integers entered as part of the input tuples, and `l3` accumulates a list of lists of integers. The list `val` will contain tuples `(a3[i], l3[i])` for each iteration of the loop, resulting in a total of `m-2` such tuples. The loop counter `_` will be 0 after the loop has completed all its iterations.
