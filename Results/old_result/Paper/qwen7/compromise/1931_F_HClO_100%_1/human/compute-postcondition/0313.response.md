Postcondition: `m` is greater than 0, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), `_` is 0 or 1, and the current value of `l3` is either not equal to a list comprehension that excludes all elements of `a3` from `l` or there is no else part in the code.
