Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, the elements at indices `i + p1` in list `l1` and `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal to `a2` and `a1`, respectively, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`; `idx2` is 0; `p2` is 1.**

The code `p2 = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `p2`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
