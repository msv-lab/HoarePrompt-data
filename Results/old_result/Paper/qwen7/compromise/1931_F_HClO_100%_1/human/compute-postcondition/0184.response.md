Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `range(m - 2)`, so the key variable here is `m`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0, meaning `m` must be at least 3.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be at least 3.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be at least 3. However, since the loop is decrementing `m` by 1 each time (as it runs from `m-2`), `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to run one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `m` must be at least 4.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be at least 4**
