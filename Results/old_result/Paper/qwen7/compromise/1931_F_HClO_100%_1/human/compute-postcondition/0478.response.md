Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `l3` is a list.
- The postcondition states that if `l3` is not equal to the list containing all elements from `l` that are not equal to `a3`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, no specific change is made to `l3` and it remains as it was initially.

### Loop Head
- The loop iterates over pairs `(a3, l3)` using `val`.

### Analysis
- The loop head contains the variables `a3` and `l3`.
- The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, we know that `l3` might or might not change depending on the value of `a3`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Values**: At the start of the loop, `a3` and `l3` are part of the tuple `val`.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each iteration, the values of `a3` and `l3` come from the current tuple in `val`.
3. **Postcondition Check**: After processing each tuple, the postcondition is checked. If the condition is satisfied, `l3` might change; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

### State Adjustment
- Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, we need to consider the state just before the next tuple is processed.
- The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the current values of `a3` and `l3` from the current tuple.

### Conclusion
- The state at the start of the next iteration should be the values of `a3` and `l3` from the current tuple in `val`.

### Final Answer
State: **`a3` is the current element from `val`, `l3` is the list associated with `a3` in `val`**
