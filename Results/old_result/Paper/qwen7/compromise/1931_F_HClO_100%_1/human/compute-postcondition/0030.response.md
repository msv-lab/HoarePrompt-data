Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. The precondition remains valid, and no new values are assigned to the variables.
