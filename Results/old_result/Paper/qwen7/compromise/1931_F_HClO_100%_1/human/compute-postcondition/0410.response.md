Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. Since no new assignments or changes to `i` or `n` occur, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
