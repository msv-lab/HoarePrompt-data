Postcondition: `t` is 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `-1`, and `p2` is 1. Either `idx2` is `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
