Output State: **`m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `a2` is the second integer input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input and splits it into multiple integers. The first two integers are assigned to `a2` and the rest are collected into a list `l2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
