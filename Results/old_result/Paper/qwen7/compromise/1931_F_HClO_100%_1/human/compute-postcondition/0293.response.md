Postcondition: `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `p2` is 1. The list `l` is either the same as `l1` with an element inserted at index `n - 2`, or a list equal to `l2` depending on the comparison between indices of `a3` and `a2` in `l3`. Additionally, if the condition is met, `m` is decreased by 1, `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, and `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`.
