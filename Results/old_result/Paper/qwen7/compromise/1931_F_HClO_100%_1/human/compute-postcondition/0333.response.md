Output State: **`m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `a2` is the second integer input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input, `l11` is a list comprehension of `l1` excluding elements equal to `a2`.**

This means that the list `l11` now contains all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
