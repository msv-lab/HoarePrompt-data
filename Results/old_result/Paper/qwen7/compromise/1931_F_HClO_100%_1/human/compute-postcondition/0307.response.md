Output State: idx1 is n - 2, idx2 is n - 2, p2 is 1, m is less than or equal to 2, a3 is a list of integers entered as input, l3 is a list of lists of integers entered as input, val is a list containing m-2 tuples (a3, l3), _ is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `m` will no longer be greater than 2, hence it will be reduced to 2 or less. The variable `a3` will be a list of integers representing the values entered during each iteration of the loop, and `l3` will be a list of lists of integers also entered during each iteration. The variable `val` will contain a total of `m-2` tuples, each consisting of an `a3` and corresponding `l3` from each iteration. The variable `_` will be set to `m-2` after the loop completes, indicating the number of iterations performed.
