Output State: **`a3` is the current element from `val`, `l3` is the list associated with `a3` in `val` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of `a3` or `l3`. It only indicates that the execution would exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional structure.
