Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 2; `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input starting from the second element.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a sequence of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3` as a list. The precondition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains unchanged.
