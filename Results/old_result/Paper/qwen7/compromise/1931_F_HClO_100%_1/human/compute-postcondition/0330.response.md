Postcondition: **`m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`. Since the if condition `m == 1` does not hold, the values of `m`, `n`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `_` remain unchanged.**
