Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. This means the loop counter is `m - 2`.
   - There are no other variables directly involved in the loop head.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - An input is taken and stored in a variable (let's call it `input_var`).
   - The loop counter `m - 2` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop counter `m - 2` remains unchanged, it does not change from one iteration to another.
   - The variable `input_var` is not affected by the loop itself and remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be considered for adjustment is the loop counter `m - 2`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`input_var` is the value taken as input, `m - 2` remains unchanged**
