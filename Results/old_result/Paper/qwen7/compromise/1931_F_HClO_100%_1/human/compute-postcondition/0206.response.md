Postcondition: `t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, and `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the index `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and the elements at indices `i + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal, and the elements at indices `i + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal to `a2` and `a1` respectively.
