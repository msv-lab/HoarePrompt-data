Output State: **`idx1` is `-1` or any value it was set to during the loop, `idx2` is `-1` or any value it was set to during the loop, `p1` is `1` or `0`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `n` is greater than `i + max(p1, p2)` where `i` is `n - 2`, and the list `val` is empty.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `val`. No changes are made to the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, or `n`. Since the list `val` is initialized to be empty, it remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
