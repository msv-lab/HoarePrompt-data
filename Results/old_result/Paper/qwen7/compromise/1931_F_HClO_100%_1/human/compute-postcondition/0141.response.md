Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head only includes the loop counter `_` and the range expression `range(m - 2)`. Since `_` is just an underscore used as a throwaway variable, it doesn't affect the state. The key part here is the range expression `range(m - 2)`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 1 (since the range function in Python starts from 0). Therefore, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Given the postconditions and the loop structure, we don't need to adjust any other variables because they are not part of the loop head. The loop itself doesn't modify these variables; it only iterates based on the value of `m`.

**State:**
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 2

So, the final answer is:
State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 2**
