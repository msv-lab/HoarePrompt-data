Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is true, `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables.
