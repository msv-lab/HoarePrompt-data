Output State: **`idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than i + max(p1, p2), `m` equals 2, and the list `val` is empty.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables or affect the list. Therefore, all the conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
