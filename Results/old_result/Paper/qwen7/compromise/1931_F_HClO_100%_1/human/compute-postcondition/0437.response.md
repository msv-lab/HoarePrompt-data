Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `l` is the same as `l1`, and the element at index `idx2` in `l1` is updated with `a1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the reference of `l1` to `l`. This does not create a new list but rather makes `l` point to the same list as `l1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
