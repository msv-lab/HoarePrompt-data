Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `a2` is the second integer input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding elements equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. No other changes are made to the variables, so their previous states remain unchanged.
