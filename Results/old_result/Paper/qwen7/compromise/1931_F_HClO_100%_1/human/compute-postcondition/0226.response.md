Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `idx1` and `idx2`, but it indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional context was provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
