State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is introduced in the loop head, but since it's defined within the loop itself (`range(n - 1)`), its initial value is irrelevant to the pre-loop state.
- The loop condition `range(n - 1)` indicates that the loop will run from `0` to `n-2`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `range(1)`, for example, would result in no iterations).
- The variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` are not used in the loop condition or initialization, so their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `n` must be greater than 1.
