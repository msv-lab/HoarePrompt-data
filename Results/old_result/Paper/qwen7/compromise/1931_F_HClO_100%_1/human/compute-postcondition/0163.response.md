Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` from the iterable `val`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as there are more tuples in `val` that satisfy the condition specified in the problem statement.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `val` must have at least one tuple.
   - `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - If `l3` is not equal to a list containing elements of `l` excluding `a3`, the loop breaks.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `l3` is equal to the list of elements of `l` excluding `a3`, we need to ensure that `l3` remains the same for the next tuple in `val`.
   - `a3` will change to the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `val` should now point to the next tuple in the sequence.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `val` must have at least two tuples remaining.
- `a3` will be the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
- `l3` will be the second element of the next tuple in `val`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`val` must have at least two tuples remaining, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`.**
