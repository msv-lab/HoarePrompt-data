Output State: **`idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, the list `val` is empty, and the list `l1` has an element inserted at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the index `idx2`. Since `idx2` is `n - 2`, the list `l1` now has an additional element at index `n - 2`. All other variables (`idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
