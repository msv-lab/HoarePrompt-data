Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, and either `idx2` is `i + 2` and `p2` is 1, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the elements at indices `(i + 3) + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `p1` is 1, either `idx2` is `i + 2` and `p2` is 1, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `p2` is 1, `idx2` is `i + 2` and `p2` is 1, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. It maintains the conditions specified in the precondition and the postconditions of the if and else parts.
