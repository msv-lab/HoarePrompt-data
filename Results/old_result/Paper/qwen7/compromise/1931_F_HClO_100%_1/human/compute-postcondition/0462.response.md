Output State: **`m` must be at least 2, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3`. The rest of the integers are collected into a list `l3`. The precondition that `m` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
