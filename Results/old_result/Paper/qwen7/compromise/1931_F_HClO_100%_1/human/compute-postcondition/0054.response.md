Postcondition: `idx1` is `-1` or `i`, `idx2` is `-1` or `i`, `p1` is `1` or `0`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `n` is greater than `1`, and either both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to `0` leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, or none of these conditions change as there is no else part.
