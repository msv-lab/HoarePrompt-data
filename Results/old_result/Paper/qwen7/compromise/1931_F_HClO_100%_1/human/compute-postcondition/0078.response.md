Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the only thing that happens is breaking out of the implied context from the initial state description. The values of `i`, `n`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged.
