### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem involves a game played on a tree structure with exactly two leaves.
   - The tree is represented as an array due to its structure.
   - Players take turns moving a stone from one node to an adjacent inactive node.
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t`.
   - Since `t = 1`, the program only processes one round.

3. **Tree Construction**:
   - The program constructs the tree using a deque. However, the logic for constructing the deque is flawed. Specifically, it does not handle the case where the tree should be constructed as a linear array properly.
   - The current implementation attempts to build the tree by appending nodes but does not ensure the correct order or structure of the tree.

4. **Start Node Identification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the starting node for the round.

5. **Move Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum distance from the start node to the ends of the array (`idx` and `n - idx - 1`).
   - The logic to determine the winner based on these distances is correct. If any of the minimum distances are odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

6. **Flawed Tree Construction**:
   - The main issue lies in how the tree is constructed. The current implementation does not correctly represent the tree as an array. Instead, it tries to maintain a deque which is unnecessary and incorrectly handles the tree structure.

7. **Correct Approach**:
   - Given the constraints, the tree can be directly represented as a list of nodes in a linear fashion.
   - The start node's index can be determined and used to calculate the minimum distances to the ends of the list.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation is incorrect due to the flawed tree construction logic. While the logic for determining the winner is correct, the program fails to properly represent the tree structure, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**
