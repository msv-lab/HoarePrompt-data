The function constructs an undirected graph representing a tree with \(n\) nodes using input edges. It then traverses the graph starting from the node \(u_1\) and alternates between two states, flipping a boolean flag `s` each time it reaches a leaf node. Finally, it prints either "Hermione" or "Ron" based on the value of `s` after traversal.
