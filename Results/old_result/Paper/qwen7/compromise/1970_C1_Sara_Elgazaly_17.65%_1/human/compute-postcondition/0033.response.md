Postcondition: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the new last element of `lst[x]` after the pop operation, `lst[x]` has at least one element left, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, and either `x` is now equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part and the conditions remain as they were.**
