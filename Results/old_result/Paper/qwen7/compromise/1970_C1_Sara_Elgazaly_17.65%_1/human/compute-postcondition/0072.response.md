Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element in `lst[x]` after popping one element, and `lst[x]` is now one element shorter, and `x` is equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. Since `y` was the last element in `lst[x]` after popping one element, `x` is now also equal to `y`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
