Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last remaining element in `lst[x]` after all possible pops, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, and `lst[x]` is now empty since it has been completely popped during the loop iterations; if `lst[y]` is not empty, `x` is now equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `s` was initially `False`. The code `s = not s` changes the value of `s` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
