Output State: **`s` is False, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last remaining element in `lst[x]` after popping one element, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, and `lst[x]` now contains one less element than before.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops (removes and returns) the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. This means `y` now holds the last remaining element in `lst[x]` after one element has been popped. All other variables remain unchanged.
