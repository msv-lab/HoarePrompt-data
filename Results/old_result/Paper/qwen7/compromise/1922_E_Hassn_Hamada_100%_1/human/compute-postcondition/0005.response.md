Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `max(sequence, default=0)`, which determines the starting value of `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`. This means `i` will take values starting from `max(sequence, default=0)` and decrementing until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the initial value of `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. Since `i` starts from `max(sequence, default=0)`, this value must be greater than or equal to `0` (because if it were less than `0`, the loop would not start).

4. **Consider the given state**: The state before the loop starts is `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`. This does not directly provide information about `sequence`, but we know that `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**: The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, and the value of `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**
