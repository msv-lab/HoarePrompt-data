Output State: **`size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 4, `sequence` contains [6, 7]**.

Explanation: The code `sequence.append(i + overlap)` appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`. Given that `i` is 4 and `overlap` is 3, `i + overlap` equals 7. Therefore, the list `sequence` now contains the elements `[6, 7]`. The values of `size`, `i`, and `overlap` remain unchanged.
