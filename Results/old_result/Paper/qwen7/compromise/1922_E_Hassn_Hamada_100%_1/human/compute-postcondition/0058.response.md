Postcondition: **`size_overlap` is 21, `i` is 3, `size` is 25, `number` must be greater than or equal to 4194296, `value` is 33554430.** 

This means that after executing the if statement, `size_overlap` remains unchanged at 21, `i` remains at 3, `size` is incremented to 25, `number` remains unchanged, `value` is set to 33554430, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
