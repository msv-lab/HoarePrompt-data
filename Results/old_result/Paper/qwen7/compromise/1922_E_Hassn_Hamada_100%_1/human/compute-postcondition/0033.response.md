Output State: **`size_overlap` is (3, 0), `i` is 2, `size` is 5, `number` must be at least 28, `value` is 30**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given `size` is 5 and `i` is 2, `value` becomes `(1 << 5) - (1 << 2)`, which is `32 - 4 = 28`. So, `value` is updated to 30. The other variables remain unchanged.
