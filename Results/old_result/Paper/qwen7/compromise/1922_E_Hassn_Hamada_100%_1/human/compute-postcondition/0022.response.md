Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`. This means `i` starts from the maximum value of `sequence` (or 0 if `sequence` is empty) and decreases until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `size_overlap` is `(3, 0)`
   - `i` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `size` is `i + 1`
   - `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))`
   - `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than `-1`. Since `i` is currently greater than or equal to 2, it will decrease in each iteration.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will decrease by 1 in the next iteration.
   - `size` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `number` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `value` will be recalculated based on the new `size` and `i`.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be decreased by 1, so if `i` was `2` before, it will become `1` in the next iteration.
- `size` will be `i + 1`, so if `i` is now `1`, `size` will be `2`.
- `number` will be updated to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))`, so if `i` is `1`, `number` will be `3 * (1 << 0) = 3`.
- `value` will be `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, so if `i` is `1` and `size` is `2`, `value` will be `(1 << 2) - (1 << 1) = 4 - 2 = 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`size_overlap` is `(3, 0)`, `i` is 1, `size` is 2, `number` must be greater than or equal to 3, `value` is 2**
