Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `size_overlap` is (2, 0)
   - `i` must be greater than or equal to 0
   - `size` is `i + 1`
   - `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << i)`
   - `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop head involves the variables `size` and `i`.

4. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.
   - Given `size` is `i + 1`, the condition becomes `(1 << (i + 1) + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`, which simplifies to `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) <= number`.

5. **Check the Current Values**:
   - `size` is `i + 1`.
   - `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << i)`.

6. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) <= number` must hold true.
   - This means that `number` must be large enough to satisfy this inequality when `i` increases by 1.

Given these points, let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `i` must be increased by 1 for the loop to continue.
- `size` will then become `i + 1`.
- `number` must be large enough to satisfy the new condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` and `number`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`size_overlap` is (2, 0), `i` must be greater than or equal to 1, `size` is `i + 1`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`**
