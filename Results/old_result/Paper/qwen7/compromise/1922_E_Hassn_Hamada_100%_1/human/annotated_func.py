    #This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `size_overlap` has been updated to (25, 3). This means that the final values of `size` and `i` that satisfy the condition within the loop are 25 and 3, respectively. The variable `i` is set to 3 after the loop completes, and `size` is calculated as `i + 1`, which equals 25. Additionally, the condition for `number` must be met, which is being greater than or equal to 4194296. The value of `value` is 33554430, which is the result of the calculation `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` when `size` is 25 and `i` is 3.

    #State: Output State: `size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 25, `sequence` contains [6, 7, 8, ..., 30].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = size - overlap`, which is `25 - 3 = 22`. Therefore, the loop will execute 22 times. Starting with `i = 3`, each iteration increments `i` by 1, so after 22 iterations, `i` will be `3 + 22 = 25`. Each iteration also appends `i + overlap` (which is `i + 3`) to the `sequence` list, starting from 6 and ending at 30. Thus, the final `sequence` will contain all integers from 6 to 30.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and updates the `sequence` list. If `number` is 0, it returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a pair of values (`size` and `i`) and uses them to fill the `sequence` list with specific integers. Finally, it recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function ultimately returns two zeros, regardless of the input values.
