Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on a specific algorithm that doesn't directly relate to generating an array with a specified number of increasing subsequences. This function seems to be implementing a binary representation-based approach which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

2. **Output Mismatch**: The expected behavior is to generate an array of integers where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. However, the current implementation does not ensure this condition. For example, it generates sequences based on binary representations rather than ensuring the exact count of increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is very large or small. It also does not provide a solution for all possible values of `X` within the given constraints.

4. **Algorithmic Approach**: The approach used in `func_1` does not guarantee that the generated array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Instead, it generates a sequence based on a binary-like pattern which is not relevant to the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to use a combinatorial approach or dynamic programming to ensure that the generated array meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
