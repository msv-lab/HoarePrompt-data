Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` seems to be designed to generate a sequence based on the input number, but it does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

For instance, consider the test case where `X = 37`. The program generates an array `[ -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1 ]`, which does not meet the requirement of having exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The correct approach would involve generating a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`. The current implementation does not guarantee this, and thus the program is incorrect.
