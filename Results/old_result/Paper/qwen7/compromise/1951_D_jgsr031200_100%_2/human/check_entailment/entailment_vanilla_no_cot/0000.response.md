Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program only handles the simplest cases where `n` equals `k` or `n` is greater than `k`. It fails to handle more complex scenarios where the number of stalls and their respective prices need to be determined to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Logic Flaw in `func_1` Function**: The logic in `func_1` function is flawed. It attempts to use binary search (`bs`) which is not defined in the code, and it also does not properly distribute the number of stalls and their prices to achieve the exact number of jewels Alice needs to buy.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `func_1` does not implement the full solution required to set up the stalls and prices correctly. It only prints "YES" or "NO" without providing the necessary details about the stalls and their prices.

### Correct Solution Outline:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
- Determine the number of stalls required.
- Assign prices to these stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels when she visits them in order.

Here’s a conceptual approach to solving the problem:
1. **Determine the Number of Stalls**: Calculate the minimum number of stalls needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. **Assign Prices**: Assign prices to the stalls such that the sum of jewels Alice buys from each stall equals `k`.

This requires a more detailed algorithmic approach rather than the current simplistic handling in the provided code.
