### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. If possible, we need to output the number of stalls and the prices for those stalls.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It then calls `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES", 1 (indicating one stall), and 1 (indicating the price of 1 coin per jewel). This is a trivial case.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy even one jewel.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is an attempt to split the problem into two parts, but it is flawed because it assumes only two stalls, which may not always be sufficient to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each part (`curr`) and updates `h` (total number of stalls needed) and `n` (remaining coins after buying jewels).
   - Finally, it checks if `h` (total stalls) is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2 (indicating two stalls), and the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling the trivial case (`n == k`) is correct.
   - The logic for handling the case where `n < k` is correct.
   - However, the logic for splitting the problem into two parts and calculating the number of stalls and prices does not fully address the problem requirements. Specifically, it assumes only two stalls, which may not always be sufficient to achieve exactly `k` jewels. For example, consider the following scenarios:
     - **Test Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
       - The code correctly prints "YES", 1, and 1.
     - **Test Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
       - The code incorrectly prints "NO" instead of "YES" and the appropriate number of stalls and prices.
     - **Test Case 3**: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
       - The code correctly prints "YES", 8, and the appropriate prices.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - The provided example in the problem description shows that the code fails to correctly handle the case where `n = 6` and `k = 4`. The code incorrectly prints "NO" instead of "YES" and the appropriate number of stalls and prices.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when more than two stalls are needed. Therefore, the code is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
