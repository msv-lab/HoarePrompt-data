### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Case When \( n = k \)**:
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. This is correct.

3. **Case When \( n < k \)**:
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO" and returns. This is also correct because Alice cannot buy even one jewel under these conditions.

4. **Case When \( n \ge k \)**:
   - Here, the logic is flawed. The program attempts to set up stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the implementation of the logic to achieve this is incorrect.
   - Specifically, the code calculates the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, but this does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The values in `costs` are not correctly derived to ensure the desired outcome.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices from the `costs` list, but the `costs` list is not properly initialized or populated. This results in incorrect output.

### Example Analysis:

- For the input `7 3`:
  - The program correctly identifies that `n >= k` and prints "YES".
  - It should then print the number of stalls and their prices, but instead, it prints "NO" and an empty list, which is incorrect.

- For the input `6 4`:
  - The program correctly identifies that `n >= k` and prints "YES".
  - It should then print the number of stalls and their prices, but instead, it prints "NO" and an empty list, which is incorrect.

- For the input `255 8`:
  - The program correctly identifies that `n >= k` and prints "YES".
  - It should then print the number of stalls and their prices, but instead, it prints "NO" and an empty list, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
