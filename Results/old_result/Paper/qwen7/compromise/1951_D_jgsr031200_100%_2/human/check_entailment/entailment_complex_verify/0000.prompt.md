You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `costs`. Initially, `costs[0]` is `n - k + 1` and `costs[1]` is `1`. In each iteration, `curr` is set to `n` divided by the current element in `costs`, then `h` is incremented by `curr`, and `n` is reduced by `i * curr`. Since `n` starts as a positive integer and gets reduced in each iteration, it will eventually become 0. After the first iteration with `i = n - k + 1`, `curr` will be 1 because `n // (n - k + 1)` equals 1. Then `h` will increase by 1 and `n` will be reduced by `n - k + 1`. In the second iteration with `i = 1`, `curr` will be `n // 1`, which is now `n - (n - k + 1)`, so `h` will increase by `n - (n - k + 1)`, and `n` will be reduced to 0.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: [] (assuming costs is an empty list)
    #State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, `n` is 0, and if `h` is less than `k`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function continues with the else part where `h` is adjusted accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers between 1 and \(10^{18}\). It checks if `n` is equal to `k`, in which case it prints "YES" followed by three 1s and returns `n`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and returns `None`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of divisions of `n` by elements in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and stores it in `h`. If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The function ultimately returns `n` if the conditions are met or `None` otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to solve the problem using a binary search-like approach, but it does not handle the scenario where the number of stalls needed exceeds 60 or where the prices are set appropriately to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Stall Prices**: The program sets the prices for the first two stalls as `n - k + 1` and `1`. However, this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels across multiple stalls. For instance, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program sets the prices as `[255-8+1, 1] = [248, 1]`. This means Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall and no jewels from the second stall, totaling only 1 jewel, which is far less than `k`.

2. **Lack of General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution to set the prices for up to 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It only handles the case where the number of stalls is limited to 2, which is insufficient for many test cases.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program fails to handle cases where the number of stalls needed exceeds 60, or where the prices need to be set in a more complex manner to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `255 8`
- Expected Output: `YES` followed by the appropriate stall prices.
- Actual Output: The program outputs `NO`, indicating it cannot find a solution, which is incorrect because a valid solution exists.

A correct implementation would involve setting up a series of stalls with carefully chosen prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The current implementation does not achieve this, hence the program is incorrect.
