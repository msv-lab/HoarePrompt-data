Reasoning:
1. The program needs to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and price them such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. The provided solution attempts to solve this problem but has several issues:
   - The function `bs` is defined but never used.
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the process of Alice buying jewels from multiple stalls.
   - The approach to calculate the number of stalls and their prices is flawed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The solution does not handle all edge cases, such as when `n` is very close to `k`.

Let's analyze the provided code:

- The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as inputs.
- It first checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If true, it prints "YES" and 1, which is incorrect because setting up just one stall with a price of 1 would not necessarily result in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels.
- If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO", which is correct.
- For the case where `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of divisions of `n` by elements in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and stores it in `h`. However, this calculation does not accurately reflect the process of Alice buying jewels from multiple stalls.
- It then prints "YES" and 2, and the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which is also incorrect because it does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
