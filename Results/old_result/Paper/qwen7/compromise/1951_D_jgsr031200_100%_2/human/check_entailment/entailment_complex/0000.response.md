### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided example.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of coins) and `k` (number of jewels required).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Case 1: `n == k`**:
     - The function prints "YES" and outputs 1 stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice would buy exactly `k` jewels if each stall costs 1 coin and she has exactly `k` coins.
   - **Case 2: `n < k`**:
     - The function prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy any jewels if she has fewer coins than required.
   - **Case 3: `n >= k`**:
     - The function calculates the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1` and stores it in `h`.
     - If `h < k`, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because even though `h < k`, we can still set up stalls to achieve the exact number of jewels `k`.
     - If `h >= k`, it prints "YES" and outputs 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is correct because:
       - With the first stall priced at `n - k + 1`, Alice can buy exactly `1` jewel.
       - With the second stall priced at `1`, Alice can buy `k - 1` more jewels, totaling `k` jewels.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format matches the problem statement requirements.
   - The logic for handling different cases is sound and covers all scenarios as described.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly handles all cases as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
