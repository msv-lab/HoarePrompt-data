Output State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list. Initially, the first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`. In each iteration, `curr` is set to `n` divided by the current value of `i` (which alternates between `n - k + 1` and `1`). Then, `h` is incremented by `curr` and `n` is reduced by `i * curr`. After the first iteration, `n` becomes `(n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1)) - (n - k + 1) = 0`. In the second iteration, `n` becomes `1 * (n // 1) - 1 = 0`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `n` will be `0`, and `h` will be the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
