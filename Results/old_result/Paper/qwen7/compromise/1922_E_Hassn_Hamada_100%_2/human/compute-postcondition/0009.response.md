Output State: **`i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, `size` is `i + 2`, and `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << max(sequence, default=0))**.

Explanation: The code calculates `value` as `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given that `size` is `i + 2`, `value` becomes `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`. The initial conditions for `i` and `size` remain unchanged.
