Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number\).

2. **Analyze the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `size`: This is derived from `i` as `size = i + 1`.
   - `i`: This is the variable that affects both `size` and the loop condition directly.
   - `number`: This is a given constraint that must be satisfied for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1.
   - `size` is `i + 1`.
   - `value` is not relevant to the loop condition.
   - `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\).
   - `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`.

4. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - The loop condition is \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number\).
   - Substituting `size = i + 1`, the condition becomes \((1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) \leq number\).
   - Simplifying, this is \(4 \cdot (1 << i) - (1 << i) = 3 \cdot (1 << i) \leq number\).

5. **Ensure the loop condition is met**:
   - We know `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\).
   - Since \(3 \cdot (1 << i)\) is always less than \(7 \cdot (1 << i)\), the condition \(3 \cdot (1 << i) \leq number\) is always true given the constraint on `number`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `number` to ensure it meets the minimum requirement for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `number` is at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), and `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`**.
