Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `number`, which is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `sequence`, which is a list of integers where each element is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The function returns a tuple (0, 0).**

This means the function `func_1` takes an integer `number` between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and a list `sequence` of integers, and regardless of the values of `number` and `sequence`, it always returns a tuple containing two zeros.
