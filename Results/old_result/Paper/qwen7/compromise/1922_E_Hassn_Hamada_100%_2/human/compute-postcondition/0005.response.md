Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `max(sequence, default=0)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `max(sequence, default=0)`, and it decrements `i` until it reaches -1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to -1 initially. This means `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Consider the given state**: The state before the loop starts is `size_overlap` is (0, 0). This information is not directly relevant to the loop initialization but might be useful for understanding the context.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**: The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`, which is initialized to `max(sequence, default=0)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is non-negative for the loop to start executing.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is `max(sequence, default=0)` and must be greater than or equal to 0**
