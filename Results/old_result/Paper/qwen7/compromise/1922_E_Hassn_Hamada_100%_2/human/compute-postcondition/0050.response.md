Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 4`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(15 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was `i + 3`, so after executing the code, `size` becomes `i + 4`. All other variables (`i`, `value`, `number`, and `size_overlap`) remain unchanged.
