Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence, `size` is `i + 4`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`, and `size_overlap` is `size, i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `size` and `i` to `size_overlap`. Since `size` is `i + 4` and `value` is `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`, these values remain unchanged. The new variable `size_overlap` is created and assigned the tuple `(size, i)`. All other variables retain their initial states.
