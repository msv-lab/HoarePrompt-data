You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which means it will run from `i = 0` to `i = 3` (since `size` is 5 and `overlap` is 2). After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 3. The `sequence` list will contain the values `[2, 4, 6]`, as each iteration appends `i + overlap` to the list, starting from `2` (when `i = 0`) and ending with `6` (when `i = 3`).
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by appending specific values to it. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns the tuple (0, 0).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` seems to be designed to generate a sequence based on a specific algorithm, but it does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`.

For instance, consider the case where `X = 2`. The program should generate an array of length 1 with a single element `0`, because an array of length 1 has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element). However, the program outputs:

```
1
0
```

This is correct for `X = 2`. But for other values of `X`, the program may fail. For example, for `X = 5`, the program should generate an array `[0, 1, 0]` which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. However, the program generates:

```
3
0 1 0
```

This is correct for `X = 5`. But for `X = 13`, the program should generate an array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences. However, the program generates:

```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```

For `X = 37`, the program should generate an array `[-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1]` which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. However, the program generates:

```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```

The issue lies in the way `func_1` is implemented. It does not guarantee that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
