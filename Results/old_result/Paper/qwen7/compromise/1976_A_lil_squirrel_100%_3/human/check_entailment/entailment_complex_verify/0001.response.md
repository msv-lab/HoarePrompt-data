### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Separating Characters:**
   - The program correctly separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - This step is also correct and matches the problem requirements.

3. **Sorting Checks:**
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(letters)`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(digits)`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - These checks are implemented correctly and match the problem requirements.

4. **Order Check:**
   - The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If this condition is violated, it returns 'NO'.
   - This check is also implemented correctly and matches the problem requirements.

5. **Final Return:**
   - If all conditions are satisfied, the program returns 'YES'.
   - This final step is correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the program. The program correctly implements all the conditions specified for a strong password as per the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
