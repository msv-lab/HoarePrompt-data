The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it reads an additional integer `x` and a list of integers `l`. It checks if any element `l[i]` in the list `l` satisfies the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an element is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such element is found after checking all elements, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
