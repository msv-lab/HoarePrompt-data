Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0, the value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, `flag` is True.**

Explanation: The line `flag = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `flag`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged.
