Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `x`, `x` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `x`, `flag` is either True or False depending on the input list, `l` is a list of integers created from the input, and no other variables have been defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `x`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` is either True or False depending on the input list, `l` is a list of integers created from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x + 1`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` is `True`, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` remains `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `l[l[i] - 1]` does not equal `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` remains `True` and no change occurs to the loop or if statement status.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x + 1`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` is `True`, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when the if condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
