Postcondition: `i` is `x`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` remains either True or False depending on the input list, `l` is a list of integers created from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains unchanged.
