Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a list of integers created from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no loop or conditional statement was specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
