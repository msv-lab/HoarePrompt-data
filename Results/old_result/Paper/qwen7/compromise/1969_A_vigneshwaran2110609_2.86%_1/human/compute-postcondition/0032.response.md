Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` is True, `l` is a list of integers created from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All other variables retain their initial states.
