Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The code correctly initializes the field dimensions (`n`, `m`), collects the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger, and sets up dictionaries and lists to keep track of these entities.
2. **Game Loop**: The loop iterates through each step of the game, correctly updating the state of the game based on the actions of the players and the Bludger.
3. **Player Actions**:
   - **Catching the Ball**: When a player catches the ball, the `carry` variable is set to the player's identifier, and the ball's position is updated to the player's position.
   - **Throwing the Quaffle**: When a player throws the Quaffle, the `carry` variable is reset to `None`, and the ball's position is updated to the player's position.
   - **Moving the Ball**: The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of the ball based on the movement direction.
4. **Bludger Actions**:
   - **Eliminating Players**: The `func_2` function correctly identifies players that are in the same position as the Bludger, marks them as eliminated, and prints the appropriate message.
5. **Scoring**:
   - **Scoring Goals**: The code correctly increments the score for the team that successfully scores in the opponent's goal and prints the corresponding message.
6. **Final Score**: The final score is correctly printed at the end of the game.

Given that the code handles all the necessary actions and conditions as described in the problem statement, and the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly, the overall program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
