Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time in the game, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their positions, and a list `blud` of Bludger positions. It identifies all players whose positions match the Bludger positions, marks them as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`, and prints a message indicating each eliminated player along with the current time `t`. After processing, the function does not return any value.**
