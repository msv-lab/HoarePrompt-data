You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the current time (step) in the game. player is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (format: R0, R1, ..., B0, B1, ...) and values are the current positions of the players (format: [x, y]). blud is a list of positions where the Bludger is currently located.
def func_2(t):
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: All keys in the `player` dictionary where the value is `blud` will have their corresponding values changed to `[-1, -1]`. The `out` list will contain all the keys from `player` that had their values changed to `blud` during the loop's iterations.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: The `out` list contains all keys from the `player` dictionary that had their values changed to `blud` during the loop's iterations. Since the loop executed 3 times, there must be at least two elements in `out`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time in the game, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their positions, and a list `blud` of Bludger positions. It does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
