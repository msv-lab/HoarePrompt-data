Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `out` is an empty list, `t` is an integer representing the current time (step) in the game, `player` is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (format: R0, R1, ..., B0, B1, ...) and values are the current positions of the players (format: [x, y]), `blud` is a list of positions where the Bludger is currently located.
Code of the loop:
for p in player:
    if player[p] == blud:
        out.append(p)
        player[p] = [-1, -1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `player` contains at least one key where the value is now `[-1, -1]`; `p` has taken on each key in the `player` dictionary during the iterations; `out` is a list containing the keys from `player` where the value of each key is `blud`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `player` contains at least one key where the value is now `[-1, -1]`; if `player[p]` equals `blud`, then `p` is appended to `out` and `out` becomes a list containing the key `p`. Otherwise, `out` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `player` contains at least one key where the value is `[-1, -1]`. If `player[p]` equals `blud`, then `out` is a list containing the key `p`, and `p` is appended to `out`. If `player[p]` does not equal `blud`, then `out` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
