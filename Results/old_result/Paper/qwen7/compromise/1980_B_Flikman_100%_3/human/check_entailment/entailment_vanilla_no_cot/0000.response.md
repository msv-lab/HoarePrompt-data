Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the conditions specified:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
3. It then reads the values shown on the cubes.
4. It sorts the cubes in non-increasing order of their values.
5. It counts how many times the favorite cube's value appears in the sorted list.
6. It also counts how many of the first `k` cubes have the favorite cube's value.
7. Based on these counts, it determines whether the favorite cube will definitely be removed (`YES`), definitely not be removed (`NO`), or may be removed or not (`MAYBE`).

The logic in the program matches the problem requirements, so the program is correct.
