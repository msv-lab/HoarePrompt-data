Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `removed_count` is 1, and the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

The code `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Given that `removed_count` was initially unspecified in the initial state but implied to start from 0 (as it is a common starting point for counters), it is now 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
