Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, and `removed_count` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Given the initial state where `removed_count` is 1 (if `sorted_a[1]` equals `favorite_value`), after executing the code, `removed_count` will be 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
