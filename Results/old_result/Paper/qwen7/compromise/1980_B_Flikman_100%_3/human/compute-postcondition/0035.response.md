Output State: **`favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times the value at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers split from input.**

The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The other variables (`favorite_count`, `i`, `k`, `removed_count`, and `sorted_a`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
