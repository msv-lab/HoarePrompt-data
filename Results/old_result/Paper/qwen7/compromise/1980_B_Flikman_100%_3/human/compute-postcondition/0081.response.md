Postcondition: ***`i` is either `k + 1` or `k + 2`, `removed_count` is either 2 or 3, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a` in descending order. If `sorted_a[i] == favorite_value`, then `i` becomes `k + 2` and `removed_count` becomes 3. Otherwise, `i` remains `k + 1` and `removed_count` remains 2.***
