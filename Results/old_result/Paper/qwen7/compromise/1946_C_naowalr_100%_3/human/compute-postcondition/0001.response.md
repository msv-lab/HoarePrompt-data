Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After all iterations of the loop, t remains unchanged, and no new variables or states are introduced. The `solve()` function is called t times, but its exact behavior is not specified, so the internal state of any variables modified within `solve()` is unknown. However, the value of t, which represents the number of times the loop has executed, is the only quantifiable aspect of the output state that can be determined from the given information.
