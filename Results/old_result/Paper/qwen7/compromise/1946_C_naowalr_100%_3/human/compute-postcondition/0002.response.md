Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and the subsequent n - 1 lines describe the edges of the tree where each edge is represented by two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n. After executing the loop, the variable `solve()` has been called t times.**
