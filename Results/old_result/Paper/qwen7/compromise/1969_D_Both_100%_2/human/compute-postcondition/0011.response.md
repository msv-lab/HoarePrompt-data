Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, `max_profit` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `prices` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `current_profit` is 0.**

The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple using a lambda function as the key for sorting. The sorting does not affect the values of other variables, so they remain unchanged.
