Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has at least one element less, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `removed_item` is True, and `current_profit` is updated to `max_profit - 2 * item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, or `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and `current_profit` is further increased by `item[0]`, `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` replaces the second smallest element in `heap` with `item` and pushes `item` into the heap. This operation does not change the value of `max_profit`, keeps `removed_item` as True, and updates `current_profit` based on the condition provided. The `combined` list has at least one element less because the second smallest element was removed from the heap and added to `combined`. The `item` is now the new second smallest element in `heap`.
