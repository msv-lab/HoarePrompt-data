Postcondition: `combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `heap` has had its last element replaced by `item`; `current_profit` is increased by the second element of `item` since the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, and `max_profit` is now greater than `current_profit`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.
