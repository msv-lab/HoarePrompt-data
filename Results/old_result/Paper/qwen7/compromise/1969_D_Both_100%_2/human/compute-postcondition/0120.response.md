Postcondition: `heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `item`, `combined` is now a list with one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, and `current_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` minus the first element of `removed_item` or increased by `item[0]`, depending on whether the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, and `removed_item` is True if the if condition is met; otherwise, `removed_item` is False.
