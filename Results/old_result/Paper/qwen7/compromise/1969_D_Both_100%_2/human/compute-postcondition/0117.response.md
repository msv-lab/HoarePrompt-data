Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `item`, `combined` is now a list with one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, and `current_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` minus the second element of `item` or increased by `item[0]`, depending on whether the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The `heappushpop` function pushes the `item` onto the heap and pops the smallest element from the heap, replacing it with `item`. This means the second smallest element in the heap (before the operation) is removed and `item` is added, making `item` the new second smallest element.
- The `combined` list is reduced by one element because the `item` was popped from it.
- The `max_profit` remains unchanged as no operation affects it.
- The `current_profit` is updated based on the condition provided, which depends on the sum of the first and second elements of `item`.
