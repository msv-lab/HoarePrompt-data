Output State: **`combined` is now one element smaller, `heap` contains the smallest element from the original `combined` and the newly popped element, `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops the last element from `combined` and pushes it into the heap using `heappush`. This means `combined` is now one element smaller than before. The heap now contains the smallest element from the original `combined` (as stated in the initial state) plus the newly popped element. The value of `k` remains `k - 1` and must still be greater than 0.
