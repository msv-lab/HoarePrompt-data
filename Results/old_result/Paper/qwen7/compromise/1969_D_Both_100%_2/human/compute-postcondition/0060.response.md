Output State: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped; `max_profit` is equal to the original `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` does not change the value of `max_profit`; it simply assigns the current value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
