Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0; `heap` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `heap`. The value of `test_cases` remains unchanged from the initial state, as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, the precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 still holds true.
