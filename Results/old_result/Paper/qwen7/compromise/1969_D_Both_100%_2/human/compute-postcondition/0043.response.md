Output State: **`combined` is now two items shorter, `heap` contains the k smallest elements from the original combined list excluding the last two popped items and the pushed item, `k` remains 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `removed_item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` holds true, or the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of `current_profit` and `max_profit`, and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.**

Explanation: The line `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the value of `removed_item[0]` from `current_profit`. The value of `removed_item[0]` is part of the `item` that was processed before this line of code. The conditions for updating `current_profit` based on the sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` remain the same. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from their initial states.
