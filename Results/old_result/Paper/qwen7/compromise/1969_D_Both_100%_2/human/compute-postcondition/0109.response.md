Output State: **`item` is the last element of `combined`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, and `combined` is now a list with one less element.**

This means that the `pop()` method removes the last element from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. The values of `max_profit` and `current_profit` remain unchanged unless `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit` in the last iteration, in which case `max_profit` would have been updated accordingly. The `combined` list is now one element shorter.
