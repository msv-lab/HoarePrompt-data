Postcondition: `combined` is now a list with one less item than before, and `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is the sum of the first and second elements of `item`.
