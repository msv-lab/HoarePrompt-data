Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `removed_item` is True, `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` is true, or `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit + item[0] - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` is false, and `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts `removed_item[0]` from `current_profit`. Since `removed_item` is True, `removed_item[0]` is implicitly treated as 1 (since `True` is equivalent to 1 in numerical operations). Therefore, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `1` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
