Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0; `heap` is an empty list; `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list for `remaining_items`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases` or `heap`. Therefore, the precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and `heap` is an empty list remains unchanged.
