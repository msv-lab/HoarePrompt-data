### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - `func_2()` correctly reads pairs of integers and returns them as a map object. However, since we need lists, we can directly convert the map object to a list using `list(map(...))`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4()` initializes variables and processes each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It reads the prices (`a_i`) and bonuses (`b_i`) for each item.
   - Prices are converted to negative values (`neg_prices`), and the combined values are sorted based on bonuses (`b_i`).

3. **Heap and Profit Calculation:**
   - A min-heap (`heap`) is used to keep track of the smallest combined values.
   - The function iteratively adds the top `k` items to the heap if they are available.
   - If there are remaining items, it calculates the profit using `func_3()`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining items, adjusting the profit based on whether the combined value is non-negative or not.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum profit and prints it at the end.

### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The heap is initialized with the top `k` items based on their combined values.
   
2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the profit by considering the combined values and adjusting the heap accordingly.
   - The logic ensures that the smallest combined values are considered first, which aligns with the optimal strategy for minimizing Alice's profit.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is zero or when there are no items to consider.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit for Alice under the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
