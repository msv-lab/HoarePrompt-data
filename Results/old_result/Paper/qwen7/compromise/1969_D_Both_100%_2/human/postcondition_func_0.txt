The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k` (with 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n), and two lists `a` and `b` consisting of `n` integers each (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). After processing these inputs, the function returns an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
