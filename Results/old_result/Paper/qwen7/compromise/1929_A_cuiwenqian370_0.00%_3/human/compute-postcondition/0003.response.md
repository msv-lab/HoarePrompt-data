Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is n - 1, `arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `right`. The initial values of `left`, `arr`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, `left` is still 0, `right` is now `n - 1`, `arr` remains a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, and `new_arr` remains an empty list.
