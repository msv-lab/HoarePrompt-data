Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True, and if the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[1]` must also be equal to `a[1` (or no change occurs). If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True if `c[1]` is neither equal to `a[1]` nor `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code simply sets the variable `possible` to `True`. Since the condition for changing the value of `possible` based on the equality of elements in lists `a` and `b` at index `i` and the value of `c[1]` is not met (as no comparison is made), `possible` remains `True`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) retain their initial conditions.
