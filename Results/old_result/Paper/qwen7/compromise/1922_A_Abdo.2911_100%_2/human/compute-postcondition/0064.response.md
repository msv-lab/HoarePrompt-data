Output State: **`possible` is False, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, the value of `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `possible = False` sets the variable `possible` to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
