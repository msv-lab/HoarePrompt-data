Postcondition: **Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. The value of `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `possible` remains True, indicating that at some point during the loop's execution, the condition where `c[i]` was found to be equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` was met for at least one `i` within the range of the loop. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace. The elements from index `i` onwards retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0. The current value of `possible` is True.**
