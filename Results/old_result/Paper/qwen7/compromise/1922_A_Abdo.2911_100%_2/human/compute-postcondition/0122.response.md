Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `False`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i]`.
