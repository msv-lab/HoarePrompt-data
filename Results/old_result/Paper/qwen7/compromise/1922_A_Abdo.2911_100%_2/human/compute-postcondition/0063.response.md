Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` remains the same, the value of `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes the input string, strips it of any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
