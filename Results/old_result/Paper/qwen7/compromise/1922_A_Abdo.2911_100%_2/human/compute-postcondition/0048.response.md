Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 0. If `c[2]` is not equal to `a[2]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c[2]` equals `a[2]` or `c[2]` equals `b[2]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
