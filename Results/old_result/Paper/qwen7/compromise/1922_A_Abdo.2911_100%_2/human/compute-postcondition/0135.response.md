Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the innermost conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
