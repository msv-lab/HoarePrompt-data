Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` retains its original value, strings `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

The code `c = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `possible`, `a`, `b`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
