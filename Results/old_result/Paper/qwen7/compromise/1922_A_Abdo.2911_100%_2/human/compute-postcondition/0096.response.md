Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `possible` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`
   - `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace
   - `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace
   - `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace
   - The elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values
   - `t` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n` and then checked against `n` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `n`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `possible` will remain True as long as the condition `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]` holds true for the new value of `i`.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their original values.
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be `n` (incremented from the previous value of `n`).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `possible` will remain True if `c[n]` is equal to `a[n]` or `b[n]`.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their original values.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

**Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True if `c[n]` is equal to `a[n]` or `b[n]`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0**.
