Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal if statement. All the initial conditions remain the same.
