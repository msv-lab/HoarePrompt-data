Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.
- `possible` is True, indicating that at some point during the loop's execution, the condition where `c[i]` was found to be equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` was met for at least one `i` within the range of the loop.
- The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace.
- The elements from index `i` onwards retain their original values.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- The current value of `possible` is True.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
