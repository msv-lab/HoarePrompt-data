Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, we continue without changing the values of `i`, `n`, `possible`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
