The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. The conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[1]` must also be equal to `a[1` (or no change occurs). If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True if `c[1]` is neither equal to `a[1]` nor `b[1]`.**
