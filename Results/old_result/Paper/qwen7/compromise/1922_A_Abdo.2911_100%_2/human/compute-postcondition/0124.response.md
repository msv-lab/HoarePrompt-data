Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the comparison between `c[i]` and `a[i]` was being checked. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
