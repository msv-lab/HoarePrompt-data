Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0. The loop has completed all its iterations without finding a case where `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, so `possible` remains `True`.**
