Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`; `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, the elements of lists `a` and `b`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
