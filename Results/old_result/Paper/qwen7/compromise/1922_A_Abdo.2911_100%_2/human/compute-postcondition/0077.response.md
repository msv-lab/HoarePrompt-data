Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is False, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` is equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
