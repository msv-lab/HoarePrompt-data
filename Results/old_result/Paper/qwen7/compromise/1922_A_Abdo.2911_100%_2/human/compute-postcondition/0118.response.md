Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` is `False`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `possible` to `False`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
