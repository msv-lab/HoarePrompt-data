Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. No other changes are made to the values of the other variables. Therefore, the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
