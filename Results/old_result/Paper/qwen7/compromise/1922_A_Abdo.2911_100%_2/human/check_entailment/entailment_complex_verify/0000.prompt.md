You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        possible = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace, and `t` is greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of cases), an integer n (length of strings), and three strings a, b, and c (each of length n). For each test case, it checks if it's possible to rearrange string c into either string a or b by swapping characters. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. However, this logic is insufficient because it does not account for the possibility that `a[i]` and `b[i]` could be different and still allow a valid template to exist.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

In this case, the program will output "YES", but according to the problem description, there is no template that would make `aa` and `bb` match while `ab` does not. The correct output should be "NO".

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for each position `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is different, or `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` is consistent with at least one of them. The current implementation does not fully cover these scenarios.
