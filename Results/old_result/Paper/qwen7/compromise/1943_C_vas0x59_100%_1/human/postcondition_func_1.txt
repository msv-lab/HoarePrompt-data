The function processes a tree structure defined by the number of vertices `n` and their adjacency list `u2vs`. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice, calculates some values using `func_1`, constructs a path from a starting node `b` to another node, and then based on the length of this path, it populates a list `ops` with specific tuples. Finally, it prints the count of elements in `ops` followed by the formatted content of `ops`. The function does not return any value and ends by returning `None`.
