Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 2, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` contains `[u-1, v, u], u` and `v` are now integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The values of `n`, `u2vs`, and the relationship between `u` and `v` are updated accordingly. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are now directly assigned from the input, and the list `u2vs[v]` is updated to reflect these new values.
