Output State: **`len(path_ba) - ci1` must be a positive even number, `i` is 9, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c1, 9)`**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 9, the tuple added to `ops` is `(c1, 9)`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
