Postcondition: **`d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is `previous[b]`, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `-2`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `-3`, `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(-2)` to `u-1`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `-1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `n == -1`, the function continues as normal without any changes.**
