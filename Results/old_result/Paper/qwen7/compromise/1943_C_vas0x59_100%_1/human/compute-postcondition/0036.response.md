Output State: **`d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is `previous[b]`, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `-2`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `-3`, `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(-2)` to `u-1`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `-1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not modify any variable's value or state. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
