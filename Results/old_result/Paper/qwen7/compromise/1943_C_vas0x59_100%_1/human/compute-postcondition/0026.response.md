Output State: **`d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `n-1`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `n-2`, and `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(n-2)` to `u-1`; `path_ba` is a list containing `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a list `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`. This does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `d`, `previous`, `b`, `n`, `u`, `v`, and `u2vs[v]` remain unchanged.
