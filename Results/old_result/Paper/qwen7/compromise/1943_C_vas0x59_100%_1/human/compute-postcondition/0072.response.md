Output State: The length of `path_ba` minus `ci1` must be a positive even number, `i` is 15, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 9)`, `(c2, 9)`, `(c1, 13)`, `(c2, 13)`, and `(c1, 15)`, `(c2, 15)`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be the last even number within the range specified by the loop head, which is `15` since the loop increments `i` by `2` each time and stops when `i` reaches `15`. The list `ops` will contain pairs of tuples where the first element alternates between `c1` and `c2`, and the second element of each tuple is the current value of `i` at each iteration of the loop.
