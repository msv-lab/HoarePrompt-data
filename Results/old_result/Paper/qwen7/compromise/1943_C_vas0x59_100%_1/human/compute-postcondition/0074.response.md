Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `ci`, where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`. `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples, each in the form `(c, index)`, where `index` ranges from `0` to `ci` if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `len(path_ba) - ci` must be a positive even number, `i` is equal to the second last index of `path_ba`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples where each tuple consists of either `c1` or `c2` paired with every even index from 1 up to and including the second last index of `path_ba`.**
