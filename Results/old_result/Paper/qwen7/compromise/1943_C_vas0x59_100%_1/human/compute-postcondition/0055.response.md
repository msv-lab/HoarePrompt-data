Output State: **`i` is 2; `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ops` is a list containing three tuples `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`**.

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c, i))` appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 2, the tuple added to `ops` is `(c, 2)`. Since `c` is not defined within the snippet, it retains its previous value, which is implied to be the same as the `c` from the existing tuples in `ops`. The list `ops` originally contains `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`, and after appending `(c, 2)`, it becomes `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`. The values of `i` and `ci` remain unchanged.
