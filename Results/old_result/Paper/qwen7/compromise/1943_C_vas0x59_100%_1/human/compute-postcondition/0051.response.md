Output State: **`i` is 0; `ci` is len(`path_ba`) // 2; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `i` is 0 and `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`. After executing the code, `ops` now contains the tuple `(c, 0)`, while `i` and `ci` retain their original values.
