Precondition: **The function takes no input arguments. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, and it is guaranteed that these points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t testcases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**
