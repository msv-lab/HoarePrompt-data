You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not always ensure that the entire string is partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes.

Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: The string is a palindrome.
     - For example, `s = "aaaa"`.
     - The program will check if the first character is not a palindrome, which it is not (`s[0]` is not a palindrome). It will then try to find a character that is different from the first character.
     - Since all characters are the same, `x` will remain `-1`, and the program will print "NO".
     - This is incorrect because we can partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings, e.g., `("aa", "aa")`.

2. **Case 2**: The string has a repeating pattern that makes it difficult to split.
   - For example, `s = "llllllll"`.
   - The program will check if the first character is not a palindrome, which it is not (`s[0]` is not a palindrome).
   - It will then try to find a character that is different from the first character.
   - Since all characters are the same, `x` will remain `-1`, and the program will print "NO".
   - This is incorrect because we can partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings, e.g., `("l", "llllll")`.

3. **Case 3**: The string has a mix of characters that can be split into non-palindromic substrings.
   - For example, `s = "abcde"`.
   - The program will check if the first character is not a palindrome, which it is not (`s[0]` is not a palindrome).
   - It will then try to find a character that is different from the first character.
   - The first character is different from the rest, so `x` will be set to `1`.
   - The program will then check if the substring from index `2` onwards is a palindrome, which it is not (`s[2:]` is not a palindrome).
   - The program will print "YES" and the partition `("a", "bcde")`.
   - This is correct, but the program does not handle all possible cases.

Given these cases, the program does not correctly handle all potential scenarios, particularly when the string is a palindrome or has a repeating pattern. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
