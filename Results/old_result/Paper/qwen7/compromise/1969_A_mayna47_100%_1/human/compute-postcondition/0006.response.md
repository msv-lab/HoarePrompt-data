Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct.
- `v` is a list of length `n+1` where the first element is 0, and the rest are converted from an input split and mapped to integers.

The print statement in question is:
```python
print(3)
```

This statement directly prints the integer 3. There is no dependency on any other variable or condition within the provided initial state.

Output: **3**
