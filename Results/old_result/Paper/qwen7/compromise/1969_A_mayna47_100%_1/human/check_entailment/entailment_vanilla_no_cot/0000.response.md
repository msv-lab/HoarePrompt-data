Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The initialization of the `v` array is unnecessary and redundant. The array should be initialized to zero only once.
2. **Checking Conditions**: The condition `if v[v[i]] == i:` checks if the i-th friend and their best friend's best friend are the same person. This is not sufficient to determine if the minimum number of invitations required is 2.
3. **Output Logic**: The program always prints 2 or 3 without considering all possible scenarios where fewer than 3 invitations might suffice.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships and ensure that at least one cycle of length 2 or more exists. If such a cycle exists, you can invite two people from that cycle. Otherwise, you need to invite three people.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check for cycles of length 2
    for i in range(n):
        j = v[i]
        while j != i:
            if v[j] == i:
                print(2)
                break
            j = v[j]
        else:
            continue
        break
    else:
        print(3)
```

This corrected program correctly identifies cycles and determines the minimum number of invitations needed based on the presence of such cycles.
