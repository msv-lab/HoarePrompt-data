Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 1, `s` is 0**

The variable `s` is initialized to 0, but none of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `start`, or `end`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
