Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is `end` - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`, and `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`**.

The code `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` updates the value of `s2` to be the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
