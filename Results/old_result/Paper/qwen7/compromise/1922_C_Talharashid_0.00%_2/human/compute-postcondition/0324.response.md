Postcondition: `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `start` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `inc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`.
