Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 3, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**

Explanation: The code `start -= 1` decrements the value of `start` by 1. Initially, `start` was an integer entered by the user minus 2. After decrementing, `start` becomes an integer entered by the user minus 3. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `end`, `s`, and `s2`) remain unchanged.
