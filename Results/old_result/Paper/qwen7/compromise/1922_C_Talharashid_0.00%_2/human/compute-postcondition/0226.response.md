Output State: **`start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 2, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and the original `mini`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `inc`, and `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
