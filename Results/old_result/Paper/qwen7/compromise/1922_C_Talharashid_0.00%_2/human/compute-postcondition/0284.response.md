Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `end` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `s1` as the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. Since the values of `d1`, `d2`, `start`, and `end` are not specified, `s1` is updated to this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
