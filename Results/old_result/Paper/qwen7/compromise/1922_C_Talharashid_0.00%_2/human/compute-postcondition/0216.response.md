Output State: **`start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of abs(`lst[start]` - `lst[start + 1]`) and `mini`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between the current value of `mini` (which is 11111111) and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. Since `start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1, `start + 1` would be out of bounds if `lst` has more than one element. However, since the precondition states that `start` is less than the length of `lst`, `start + 1` is valid, and the value of `mini` will be updated to the smaller of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`.
