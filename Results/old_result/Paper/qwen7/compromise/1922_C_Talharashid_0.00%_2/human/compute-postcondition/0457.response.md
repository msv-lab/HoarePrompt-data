Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 5, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 6, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. The values of `m`, `i`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
