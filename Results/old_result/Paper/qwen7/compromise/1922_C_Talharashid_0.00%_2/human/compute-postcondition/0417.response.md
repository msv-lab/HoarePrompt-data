Postcondition: `start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to 0; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`; `s` is increased by either 1 or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or not.
