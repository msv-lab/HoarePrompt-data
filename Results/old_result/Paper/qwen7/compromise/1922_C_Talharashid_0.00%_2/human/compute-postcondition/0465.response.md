Functionality: **The function accepts a list of parameters including a positive integer t, where each test case contains an integer n, a strictly increasing list of n non-negative integers a, and an integer m representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i within the range of 1 to n. The function returns results based on the queries.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a sequence of numbers and a set of queries. For each query, it compares the positions x_i and y_i in the list a and provides a specific result based on these comparisons.
