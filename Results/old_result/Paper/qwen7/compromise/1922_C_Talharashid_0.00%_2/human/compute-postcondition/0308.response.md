Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 3, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `lst`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `t`, `start`, `end`, `s`, `d1`, `d2`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
