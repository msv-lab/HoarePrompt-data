Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 5, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 3 minus 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `s1` as the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. The value of `end` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
