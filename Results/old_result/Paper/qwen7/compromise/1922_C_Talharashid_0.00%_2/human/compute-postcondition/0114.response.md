Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(m)`.
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter.
   - The variable `m` is the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0 and increment by 1 each time through the loop.
   - `m` is given as an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, the initial value of `i` should be 0.
   - The value of `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `d2[start]`, `mini`, and `m` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
