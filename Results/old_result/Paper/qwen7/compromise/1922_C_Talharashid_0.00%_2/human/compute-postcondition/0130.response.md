Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is an input integer, `end` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false.**

Explanation: The code `start, end = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `start` and `end`. The initial values of `i`, `m`, `s`, and `s2` remain unchanged. The values of `start` and `end` are updated to the integers provided by the user. The conditions for `m` and the expression for `s2` remain as they were initially defined.
