Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `start` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `inc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user, and the current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

Explanation: The line `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Initially, `s` is 0, so after executing this line, `s` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
