Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 3, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with int type.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with int type. This does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, `t`, `start`, `end`, `s`, or the contents of `d1`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and `d2` is now an additional variable with the specified initialization.
