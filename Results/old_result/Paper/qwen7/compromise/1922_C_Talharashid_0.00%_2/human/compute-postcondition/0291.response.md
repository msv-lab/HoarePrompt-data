Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `start` is the integer entered by the user - 2.
   - `end` is the integer entered by the user - 2.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` if `start >= end`.
   - `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and the loop condition is `i < m`, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is determined by the initial input and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `m` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `start` remains the same (the integer entered by the user - 2).
   - `end` remains the same (the integer entered by the user - 2).
   - `s` remains 0 (unchanged).
   - `s1` and `s2` remain the same based on the current values of `start` and `end`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `end` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` if `start >= end`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**
