Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 3, `end` is now an integer entered by the user minus 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`**.

The code updates `s2` to be the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Since the initial values of `start` and `end` are defined as "an integer entered by the user minus 3" and "an integer entered by the user minus 2" respectively, these expressions remain unchanged.
