Postcondition: `start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111, provided that `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`. If `start + 1` is not less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` remains 111111111, and the current value of `start` is `start - 1` which is greater than -1.
