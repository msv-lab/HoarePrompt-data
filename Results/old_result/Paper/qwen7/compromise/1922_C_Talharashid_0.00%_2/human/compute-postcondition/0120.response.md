Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the elements at indices `end` and `start` in the list `d1` and assigns it to the variable `s1`. Since the initial values of `start` and `end` are not explicitly given, they remain as `start - 1` and `end - 1` respectively. All other variables (`i`, `m`, `s`) retain their initial or unchanged states.
