Output State: `start` is -1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of all unique absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst`, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference found during the loop, and `d2[0]` is `s`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `start` will reach -1 since it starts from the last index of the list and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1. The variable `end` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop. The increment `inc` remains -1. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of all unique minimum absolute differences encountered between adjacent elements (including the difference between the first and last elements). The variable `mini` keeps track of the smallest absolute difference found during the loop. Finally, `d2[0]` is set to the total sum `s` after the loop ends.
