Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 3, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 2, `s` is 0, if `start < end`, then `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`; if `start >= end`, then `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**
