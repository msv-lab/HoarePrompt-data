Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head condition is `start != end`.

2. **Current states before the loop**:
   - `start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1.
   - `end` is 0.
   - `inc` is -1.
   - `s` is 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.
   - Currently, `start` is the length of `lst` minus 1, and `end` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `start` must not be equal to `end`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - If `start` is the length of `lst` minus 1 and `end` is 0, then `start` will never be equal to `end` because they are different by at least 1 (assuming `lst` has more than 1 element).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `start` and `end` are already set such that `start != end`, no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `s` is 0**
