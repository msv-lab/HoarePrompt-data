Postcondition: `start` is the length of `lst` minus 3, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`, `d2[start]` is `s`, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part directly becomes the overall postcondition. The condition `start - 1 > -1` ensures that the operations inside the if block are only executed when `start` is greater than 0. If this condition is true, `s` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`, and `d2[start]` is set to `s`. Additionally, `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`. If the condition is false, no changes are made to these variables, and the original postcondition remains valid.
