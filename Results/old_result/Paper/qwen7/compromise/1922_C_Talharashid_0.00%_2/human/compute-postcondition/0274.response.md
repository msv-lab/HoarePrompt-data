Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `end` in the list `d2` and assigns it to `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `start` is updated to `start - 1`, and `end` remains as the integer entered by the user minus 1. The value of `s` remains 0.
