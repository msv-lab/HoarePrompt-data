Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start'` is `start` plus `inc`.
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `d1[start]` is `s`.
   - `d2` and `n` are unchanged.
   - `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `end` must be 0.
   - `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
   - `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.
   - `start - 1 > -1` and `mini` is not updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `mini` if `i` is 1, otherwise `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to continue, `start` must not be equal to `end`.
   - Given that `end` must be 0, `start` must not be 0 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `end` is fixed at 0, the only way to satisfy `start != end` is to ensure `start` is not 0.
   - We need to adjust `start` to be something other than 0.

5. **Final state**:
   - `start` must be something other than 0 (since `end` is 0).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `start`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` must be something other than 0**
