You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and each set also contains n - 1 lines describing the edges of the tree where each line contains two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and each set also contains n - 1 lines describing the edges of the tree where each line contains two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n. After executing the loop, the variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration, and the `solve()` function is called with the input data for each set of input.
    #
    #In simpler terms: The number of sets of input data (represented by `t`) is reduced by one after all iterations of the loop have finished.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a tree structure defined by a series of input data sets. Each data set includes an integer t, followed by pairs of integers n and k, and then n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree. The function returns information based on the tree structure and the values of n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
