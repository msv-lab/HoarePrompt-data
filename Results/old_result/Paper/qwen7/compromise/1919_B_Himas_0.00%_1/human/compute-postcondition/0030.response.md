Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a new input string, `q` is the last character of `e`, `P` is 0, and `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+'.**

Explanation: The line `P = 0` initializes the variable `P` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
