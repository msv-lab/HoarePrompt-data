Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-', where the i-th character represents a_i = 1 if s_i = '+' and a_i = -1 if s_i = '-'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(P - M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the last character of `e`, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `q` will be the last character of the string `e`. The variable `P` will hold the total count of '+' characters encountered in `e`, and `M` will hold the total count of '-' characters (or any other character) in `e`. The values of `t`, `i`, `s`, and `e` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states since they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `e` is an empty string, `q` is the last character of the original `e` (which is now empty), `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the original `e`, and `M` is the total count of '-' or any other characters in the original `e`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The string `e` is fully processed (i.e., `e` is an empty string), `q` is not defined since `e` is empty, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the total count of non-`'+'` characters in `e`, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed (which is the length of `e`), `s` is an input integer, and `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
