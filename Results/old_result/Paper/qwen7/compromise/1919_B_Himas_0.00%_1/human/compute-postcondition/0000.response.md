Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, the loop can only execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer.

3. **Initial state**: The initial state is given as `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.

4. **Adjusting the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer. Since `t` is already within the required range (1 to 1000), we can use `t` as the input to `int(input())`.

5. **Final state**: The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, the first value of `i` will be 0, and the loop will continue until `i` is less than `t`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- The variable `i` should start from 0.
- The input to `int(input())` should be `t`, ensuring the loop can execute.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0**
