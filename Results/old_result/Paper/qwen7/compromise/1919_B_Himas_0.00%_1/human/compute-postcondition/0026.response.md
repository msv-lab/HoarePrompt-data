Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `s` is an input integer.
- `e` is a non-empty string.
- `q` is the last character of `e`.
- `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`.
- `M` is the total count of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

The expression `print(P - M)` calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters (`P`) and the number of characters in `e` that are not '+' (`M`).

Since `M` counts all characters in `e` except for '+', it includes all other characters like '-', '*', 'a', etc. Therefore, `P - M` will give us the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of all other characters in the string `e`.

Output: **P - M (where P is the total count of '+' characters in e and M is the total count of characters in e that are not '+')**
