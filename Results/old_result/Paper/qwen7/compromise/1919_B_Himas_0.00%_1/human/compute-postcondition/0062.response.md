Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the last character of `e`, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is an input integer, and `q` is not equal to '+'**.

The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Initially, `M` was 0, so now `M` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
