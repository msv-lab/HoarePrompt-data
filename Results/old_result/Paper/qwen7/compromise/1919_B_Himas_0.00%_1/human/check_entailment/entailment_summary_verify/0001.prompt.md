You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `s` (1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000) and a string `e` of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) containing characters '+' and '-'. For each test case, it counts the number of '+' characters and subtracts the number of '-' characters in `e`, then prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that all test cases have been handled, and the final output is the cumulative sum of these differences for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by its length.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` but does not use this value.
   - It then reads the string `s` and processes it to count the number of '+' and '-' characters.
   - It calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters (`P - M`), which is printed as the result.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The optimal strategy would be to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero (if possible). This way, the penalty for each segment would be zero.
   - However, the given program simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters and prints it as the result. This approach does not necessarily lead to the minimum penalty because it does not consider the optimal segmentation.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example input `-----`, the program correctly outputs `5` because there are 5 '-' characters.
   - For the example input `+-+-+-`, the program outputs `0` because the counts of '+' and '-' are equal, but this does not account for the optimal segmentation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. Instead, it only considers the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as stated.
