You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3

    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

        print(res)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: The final value of `res` will be the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `res` will accumulate the combinatorial sums based on the counts of integers in `nums`, considering all possible combinations of 3 elements and pairs, as long as their counts meet the specified conditions. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will reflect the final count of each unique integer from the `nums` list after all iterations of the loop. The final value of `res` will be the sum of all these combinatorial calculations across all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, a positive integer n indicating the size of a list, and a list a of n non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of specific combinatorial values based on the frequency of each unique integer in the list a. Specifically, it adds the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the frequency of each integer if the frequency is 3 or more, and the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from the frequency of each integer and the sum of frequencies of other integers if the frequency is 2. The function outputs the accumulated sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program attempts to count combinations of sticks but does not properly check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 3 3
```

The program will output the result without checking if the chosen sticks can form a triangle. However, the valid combinations are:
- (2, 2, 3)
- (2, 3, 3)

But the program would incorrectly count other combinations as well, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
