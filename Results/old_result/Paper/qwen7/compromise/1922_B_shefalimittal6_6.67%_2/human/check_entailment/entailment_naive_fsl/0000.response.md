Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program attempts to count combinations of sticks but does not properly check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 3 3
```

The program will output the result without checking if the chosen sticks can form a triangle. However, the valid combinations are:
- (2, 2, 3)
- (2, 3, 3)

But the program would incorrectly count other combinations as well, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
