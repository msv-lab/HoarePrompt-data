State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is not yet defined**.

Explanation:
- The only objects in the loop head are `x` (which is being iterated over from the list `nums`) and `nums`.
- For the loop to execute, `nums` must be a non-empty list because the loop iterates over each element in `nums`.
- The variable `x` is not yet defined at the start of the loop since the loop hasn't started executing. It will take on the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `nums` must be a non-empty list, and `x` is not yet defined.
