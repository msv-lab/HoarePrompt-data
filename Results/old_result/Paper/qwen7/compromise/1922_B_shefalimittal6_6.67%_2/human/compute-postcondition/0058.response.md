Output State: **The `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain counts of each integer found in the `nums` list, `res` is 0, and `x` is the last element of `nums`.**

Explanation: The given code snippet initializes `res` to 0. No changes are made to the `num_of_lens` dictionary or the `nums` list, and `x` remains the last element of `nums` after the loop completes. Therefore, the `num_of_lens` dictionary retains its initial state with the frequency count of each integer present in the original `nums` list, `res` is 0, and `x` is the last element of `nums`.
