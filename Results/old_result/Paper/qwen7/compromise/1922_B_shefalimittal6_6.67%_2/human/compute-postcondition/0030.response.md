Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`; `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. This means that `total_sum` is updated based on the values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding `cnt`. The value of `cnt` and the state of `res` remain unchanged from the initial state.
