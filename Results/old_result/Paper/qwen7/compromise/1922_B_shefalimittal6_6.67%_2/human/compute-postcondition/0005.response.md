Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` which is iterating over the list `nums`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: 
   - `nums` is a list of integers converted from the input.
   - `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, the list `nums` must contain at least one element. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop depends on the list `nums`, we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty. The initial state of `num_of_lens` being an empty dictionary does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `nums` to ensure it contains at least one integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary**
