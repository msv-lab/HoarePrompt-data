Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, with each integer's count being incremented by 1 for every occurrence in the list `nums`, `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `nums` or `num_of_lens`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `res` being set to 0.
