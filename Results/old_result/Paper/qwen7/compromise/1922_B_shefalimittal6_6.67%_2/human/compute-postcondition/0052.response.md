Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in nums`. The variables involved here are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens[x]` is 1 (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `x` is not yet defined (it means `x` hasn't taken on a value from `nums` yet).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `nums`. Once `x` takes on a value from `nums`, it will process the loop body, and then move to the next value in `nums`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is not yet defined, it means the loop is about to take the first value from `nums`.
   - Therefore, `x` will be set to the first element of `nums`.

5. **State the new state**:
   - `num_of_lens[x]` is still 1 (unchanged because `x` hasn't been defined yet).
   - `nums` remains a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `x` will be set to the first element of `nums`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is the first element of `nums`**.
