Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in nums`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `x` must be the next element in the list `nums`. Since `x` is the next element being processed, it means that `x` is currently an element from the list `nums`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - **`nums`**: Since `x` is the next element in the list, `nums` should still contain at least one element. However, since `x` is now being processed, the list `nums` will effectively have one less element (or potentially be empty if `x` was the last element).
   - **`x`**: `x` will be the next element in the list `nums`.
   - **`num_of_lens`**: The dictionary `num_of_lens` will remain unchanged as it does not depend on the loop variable `x`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `nums` must have at least one element left (since `x` is the next element being processed, there must be at least one more element in the list).
- `x` will be the next element in the list `nums`.
- `num_of_lens` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 2**.

However, to be more precise about the next iteration, we can say:

**State: `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 2**.

This is the state just before the next iteration starts.
