Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, and `x` is the next element in the list `nums`; the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the count of the integer `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
