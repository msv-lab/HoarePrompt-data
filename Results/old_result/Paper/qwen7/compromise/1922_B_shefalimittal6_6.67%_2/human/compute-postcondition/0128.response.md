Output State: The final value of `res` will be the sum of all updates made to it during the loop executions. Specifically, for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`:

- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.

The output state after the loop executes all iterations will be the initial value of `res` (which is 0) plus the sum of all these updates. The lists `nums` and the dictionary `num_of_lens` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
