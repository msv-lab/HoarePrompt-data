Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` multiplied by `math.comb(cnt, 2)`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding to it the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and the `total_sum` (which is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`). The values of `nums`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged from their initial states.
