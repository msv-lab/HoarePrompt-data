Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and the final value of `res` will be the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `res` is defined as the sum of combinations and products based on the values in `num_of_lens.values()`. After executing the given line of code, the value of `n` is updated, but the definition of `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the description of `res` as per the initial state.
