Output State: **`res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, and `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `res` was increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
- Now, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
- `total_sum` remains unchanged as the code only modifies `res` and does not affect `total_sum` directly.

Therefore, the updated state of `res` is the sum of its initial increase (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`) and the new increase (`math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`). The value of `total_sum` stays the same as it was initially defined.
