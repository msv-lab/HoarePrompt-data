Output State: The final value of `res` will be the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `res` will accumulate the combinatorial sums based on the counts of integers in `nums`, considering all possible combinations of 3 elements and pairs, as long as their counts meet the specified conditions. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will reflect the final count of each unique integer from the `nums` list after all iterations of the loop. The final value of `res` will be the sum of all these combinatorial calculations across all iterations.
