Output State: **`num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for the current `cnt`. This means that `total_sum` is updated to exclude the value of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` remains the same as the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. Additionally, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`). All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
