Output State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original `nums` list and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `nums`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `num_of_lens` will contain a count of each unique integer in the `nums` list, with each integer's count representing how frequently it appeared in the original list.
