Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, res is the sum of the combinatorial sums based on the counts of integers in nums, t is decremented by 1, n is an input integer, nums is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `nums`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `res`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
