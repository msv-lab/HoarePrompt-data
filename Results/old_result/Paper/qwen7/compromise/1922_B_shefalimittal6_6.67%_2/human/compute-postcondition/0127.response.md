Postcondition: `nums` remains a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is set to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.
