Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, updated by incrementing the count of the integer `x` by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `num_of_lens` dictionary by incrementing the count of the integer `x` by 1. If `x` is not already a key in the dictionary, it initializes the count to 0 before incrementing it. The `nums` list remains unchanged, and the `num_of_lens` dictionary is updated accordingly.
