Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `adv`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is given as 1.
   - `adv` is defined as `min(a[0] - a[1] - 1, cnt, cur)`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `adv` is greater than 0. If `adv` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `adv` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `cnt`, and `cur` determine the value of `adv`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `adv` being greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`adv` must be greater than 0**
