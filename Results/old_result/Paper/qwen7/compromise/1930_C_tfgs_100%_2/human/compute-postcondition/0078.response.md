Based on the initial state described:

- The loop will execute `cnt` times, which is 1 time.
- After the loop executes, `ans` is a list where each element is one less than the previous element, starting from the list `a`.
- The last element of `ans` will be `a[0] - cnt`.

Since the loop runs only once (`cnt` is 1), each element in `ans` will be exactly 1 less than its corresponding element in the original list `a`. Let's denote the original list `a` as `[a0, a1, a2, ..., an-1]`. After the loop, `ans` will be `[a0-1, a1-1, a2-1, ..., an-1-1]`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **a0-1 a1-1 a2-1 ... an-1-1**
