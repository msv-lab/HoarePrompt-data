Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and that `len(a)` is known.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is `n - len(a)`
- Each element in the list `a` is now sorted in descending order
- `cur` is 0
- `ans` is an empty list

We need to focus on adjusting the states related to the loop head, which involves `i` and `len(a)`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0.
- **Variable `len(a)`**: This value is necessary to determine how many times the loop will run.

### Final State:
- `i` should be 0.
- `len(a)` should be known and valid for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `len(a)` is known and valid**
