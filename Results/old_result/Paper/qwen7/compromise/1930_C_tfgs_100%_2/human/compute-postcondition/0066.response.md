Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[2] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 4`, `ans` now also contains `a[1] - 4 - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` is `cur - adv`, `counter[a[2]]` is decreased by 1, `counter[a[1]]` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `counter[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i]` in the `counter` dictionary. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]`. Therefore, `counter[a[2]]` is decreased by 1. Similarly, since `i` was 2 before the decrement, `counter[a[1]]` is also decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
