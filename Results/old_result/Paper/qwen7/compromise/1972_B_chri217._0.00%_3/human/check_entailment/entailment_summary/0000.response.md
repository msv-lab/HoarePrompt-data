Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins.
2. The given solution uses a simplified approach where it counts the number of coins facing up (`'U'`) and determines the winner based on this count.
3. The logic in `func_1` is to check if the number of coins facing up (`num_up`) is odd. If it is, Alice wins because she can make a move that leaves an even number of coins facing up for Bob, forcing him into a losing position eventually. If `num_up` is even, Bob wins because he can always respond to Alice's moves in a way that keeps the number of coins facing up even until the end.
4. This logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. In the examples:
   - For "UUDUD", the number of coins facing up is 3 (odd), so Alice wins.
   - For "UDDUD", the number of coins facing up is 2 (even), so Bob wins.
   - For "UU", the number of coins facing up is 2 (even), so Bob wins.
5. The function correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the number of coins facing up.

Given this analysis, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
