The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), consisting of only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. The function checks if it's possible to flip some of the coins so that all coins face up ("U"). If it's possible, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and determine if it's possible to make all coins face up by flipping some of them, returning 'YES' if possible and 'NO' otherwise.
