Reasoning:
- The problem requires processing a series of operations on an initially empty array and answering queries about specific elements in the final array.
- `func_1` is supposed to simulate the operations and answer the queries. However, the execution summary indicates that `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic for appending elements and extending the array as per the operations. Instead, it initializes an empty array and then, regardless of the operations, just repeats the first element for all queries.
- `func_2` correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments. Since `func_1` is flawed, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.
- Given the discrepancy between the intended functionality and the actual implementation in `func_1`, the overall program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
