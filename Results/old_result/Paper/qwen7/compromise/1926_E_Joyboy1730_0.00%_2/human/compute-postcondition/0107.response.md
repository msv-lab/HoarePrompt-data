Output State: **`k` is decreased by 0, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `pow` is 1, and `t` is 1; `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The given code initializes `tot` to 0. The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. After the loop executes 3 times, `n` becomes 1. Since `n` is no longer greater than 0, the loop terminates. The value of `k` is decreased by the sum of all elements in `L`, which remains an empty list and thus contributes 0 to the decrease in `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, `pow`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial values.
