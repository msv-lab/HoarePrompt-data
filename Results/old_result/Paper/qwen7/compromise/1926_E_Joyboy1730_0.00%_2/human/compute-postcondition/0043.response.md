Output State: **`k` is unchanged - `tot`, `L` must have at least one element, `a` is the next element in `L`, `tot` is now equal to `tot + a`, `pow` is doubled.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `tot`, which means `k` is now `k - tot`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `L` still has at least one element, `a` is still the next element in `L`, `tot` is now increased by `a`, and `pow` is doubled.
