The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. To ensure that the loop can execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `_` is now 1, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list**
