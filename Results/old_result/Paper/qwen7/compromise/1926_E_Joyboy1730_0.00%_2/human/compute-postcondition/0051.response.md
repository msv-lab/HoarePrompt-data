Output State: **`k` is unchanged from its initial value, `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is `n - m`, `m` is equal to (`n` + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `n` is decremented by `m`. Since `m` is defined as (`n` + 1) // 2, the new value of `n` becomes `n - m`.
- The value of `m` remains (`n` + 1) // 2 because the code does not change its definition.
- The values of `k` and `tot` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
