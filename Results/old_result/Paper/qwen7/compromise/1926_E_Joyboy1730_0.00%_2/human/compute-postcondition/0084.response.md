Output State: **`k` is decreased by `tot`, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is 4, `L` must still contain at least one element, `a` is the first element in `L`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the values of `k`, `n`, `m`, `pow`, `L`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional it was in.
