Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `_` is now 1, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

The code calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is a non-zero integer. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged from their initial states.
