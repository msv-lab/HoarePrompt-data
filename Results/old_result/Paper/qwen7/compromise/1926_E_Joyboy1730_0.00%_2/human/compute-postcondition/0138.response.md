Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within specific ranges (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. It returns a value based on the relationship between `n`, `k`, and `t`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes these integers to perform some calculation or check conditions involving `n`, `k`, and `t`. However, without the exact logic, the focus here is on the parameters and their valid ranges.
