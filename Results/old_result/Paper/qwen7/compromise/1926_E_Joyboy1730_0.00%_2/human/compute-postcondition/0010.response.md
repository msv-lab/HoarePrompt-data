Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero.

2. **Current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5⋅10^4.
   - `_` is now 1.
   - `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `L` is an empty list.
   - `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to continue.

4. **Evaluate the current value of `n`**:
   - `n` is defined as `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
   - Simplify the expression: `n - (n + 1) // 2 = n - (n // 2 + 1 // 2) = n - n // 2 - 0.5`.
   - Since `n` is an integer, `n - n // 2 - 0.5` simplifies to `n // 2`.

5. **Ensure `n` is non-zero**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n // 2` must be non-zero.
   - This means `n` itself must be greater than 1 (since `n // 2` would be 1 when `n` is 2).

6. **Final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5⋅10^4, `_` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
