Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `_` is now 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0**.

This output state reflects that the variable `tot` has been initialized to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
