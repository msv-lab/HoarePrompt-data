The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t (number of test cases), n, and m. For each test case, it checks if n is greater than or equal to m and if (n - m) is divisible by 2. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the output containing a series of 'YES' and 'NO' strings corresponding to each test case.
