Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' strings printed based on the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n >= m` for each test case provided by the user. Each test case is defined by two integers `n` and `m`, and the loop will execute `int(input())` times, where `input()` reads the number of test cases from the user.
