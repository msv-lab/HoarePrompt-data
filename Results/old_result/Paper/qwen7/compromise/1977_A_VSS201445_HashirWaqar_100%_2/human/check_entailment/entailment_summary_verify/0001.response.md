### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes left in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net effect of these moves must result in `m` cubes.
   - If we denote the number of moves to add a cube as `add` and the number of moves to remove a cube as `remove`, then `n = add + remove` and the net effect is `add - remove = m`.

3. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because you can't have more cubes than the total number of moves.
   - The difference between the number of add moves and remove moves should be equal to `m`. This means `(add - remove) = m`.
   - Since each add and remove move changes the count by 1, the difference `m` must be even if we consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the total moves `n`.

4. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Verification**:
   - The condition `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to achieve `m` cubes.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference is even, which aligns with the requirement that the net effect of add and remove moves results in an even change when `n` is considered.

6. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `t` (number of test cases), `n`, and `m`.
   - For each test case, it checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is divisible by 2. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - The function correctly handles the logic described above.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**True**
