Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins (facing up or down) in a circular arrangement.
- The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins facing up (`'U'`).
- The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `'U'` characters in the string `s`.
- If the count of `'U'` characters is odd, the function returns `'NO'`, indicating that Alice will not win.
- If the count of `'U'` characters is even, the function returns `'YES'`, indicating that Alice will win.
- Given the rules of the game and the logic implemented in the function, the function correctly determines the winner based on the initial configuration of coins.

Correctness: **True**
