Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop (if there was one).
