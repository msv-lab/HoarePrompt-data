Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is less than `high`.

The expression to be evaluated and printed is `p1 - cur + p3`.

Let's break it down:

1. `p1` is one of the integers from the input.
2. `p3` is another integer from the input.
3. `cur` is an integer that is less than `high`, where `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Given these details, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to:
\[ \text{Result} = p1 + p3 - cur \]

Since `cur` is less than `high`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` can take any value less than either `p3 - p1` or `p3 - p2`.

Therefore, the exact value of `cur` is not specified, but we know it is less than `high`.

Output: **p1 + p3 - cur (where cur is an integer less than the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2)**
