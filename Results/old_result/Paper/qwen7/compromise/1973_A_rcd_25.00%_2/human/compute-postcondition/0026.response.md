Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the opposite of `low`.
- `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)` or greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `while high >= cur:`

### Analysis
To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition `high >= cur`.

- **Variables in the loop head**: `high` and `cur`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - If `high` is exactly equal to `cur`, the loop will terminate.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `high` must be strictly greater than `cur`.

2. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that `high` is greater than `cur` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `cur` is already determined based on the current values of `low` and the comparison involving `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we cannot change `cur`.
   - Thus, we need to adjust `high` to be greater than `cur`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `high` to be greater than `cur`.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, and `high` must be greater than `cur`**.
