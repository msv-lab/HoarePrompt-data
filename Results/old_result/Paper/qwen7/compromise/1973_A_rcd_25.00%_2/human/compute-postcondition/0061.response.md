Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, `cur` remains as `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `low + 1`.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on `high` and `cur`.
   - For the loop to continue, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `high` is a key factor in determining whether the loop should continue, we need to ensure that `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - The value of `cur` could change during each iteration, but for the loop to continue, `high` must remain greater than or equal to the new value of `cur`.

Given the current state, `cur` has either remained as `low` or has been updated to `low + 1`. Therefore, to ensure the loop continues, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1` (the maximum possible value of `cur`).

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`**.
