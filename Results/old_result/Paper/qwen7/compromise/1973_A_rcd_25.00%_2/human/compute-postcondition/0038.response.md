Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, `cur` equals `high`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, since the loop continues as long as `high >= cur`, and `cur` is incremented by 1 each time the condition `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, `cur` will eventually become equal to `high`. This is because `cur` starts from `low` and increments until it reaches `high`. At this point, the loop terminates, and no further changes occur to the variables within the loop.
