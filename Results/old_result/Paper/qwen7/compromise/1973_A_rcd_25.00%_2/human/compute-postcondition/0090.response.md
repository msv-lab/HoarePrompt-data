Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`, and `(p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur))` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not modify any variable's value but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the given code snippet, all the initial conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that we break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.
