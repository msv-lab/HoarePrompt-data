Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` (which is just a placeholder variable) and `t`. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it does not affect the state. The only relevant variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - The loop body processes some input and updates `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` based on certain conditions.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop body processes the input and updates the variables but does not change the value of `t` directly (assuming no external input changes `t`), `t` will remain the same unless explicitly decremented or modified within the loop body.

5. **Assumption about the loop body**: Given the postconditions and the lack of explicit decrement in the provided information, we assume that `t` remains unchanged within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, with the only adjustment being that `t` must still be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd and the current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, and `cur` is equal to `high`, `t` must be greater than 0**.
