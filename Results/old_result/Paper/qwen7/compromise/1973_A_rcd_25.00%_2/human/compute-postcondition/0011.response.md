Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input split by spaces.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- The current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(p1 + p2)`.

Given that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned from the input, and their sum is odd, one of these integers must be odd, and the other two must be either both even or both odd. Since `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it implies that `p3` must be odd (because if `p3` were even, the sum of `p1` and `p2` would also have to be odd, but then `p3` being even would contradict the requirement that `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`).

Therefore, `p1` and `p2` must both be even (since their sum plus an odd number `p3` results in an odd number).

When we print `p1 + p2`, we are printing the sum of two even numbers, which is always even.

Output: **an even number (where the number is the sum of p1 and p2, both of which are even)**
