Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd and the current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, and `cur` is equal to `high`.
