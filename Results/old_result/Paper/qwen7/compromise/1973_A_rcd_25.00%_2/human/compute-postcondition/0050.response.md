Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`**.

The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `low`, which was previously calculated as the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
