Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, `cur` is equal to `high`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be equal to `high`. This is because the loop continues as long as `high >= cur`, and each iteration increments `cur` by 1 until it reaches `high`. Once `cur` equals `high`, the loop condition becomes false, and the loop terminates. At this point, `cur` holds the value of `high`, and no further changes occur to any of the other variables within the loop.
