Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.

Let's break it down:

1. `p1` and `p3` are directly provided as part of the input.
2. `cur` is less than or equal to `high`, where `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Given these conditions, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to:

\[ \text{Result} = p1 + p3 - cur \]

Since `cur` is less than or equal to `high`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` can take any value from 0 up to the larger of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

However, without specific values for `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cur`, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. But we can describe it in terms of the variables involved.

Output: **p1 + p3 - cur (where p1, p3, and cur are as described in the initial state)**
