Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `high + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cur` is less than `high`. After executing `cur += 1`, `cur` becomes `high + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
