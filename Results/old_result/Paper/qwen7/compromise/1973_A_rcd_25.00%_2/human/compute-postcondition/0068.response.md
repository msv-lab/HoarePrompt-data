Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`.
   - `cur` must be less than `high`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(p1 - cur + p3)
   ```

Given these conditions, let's determine the value of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`:

- `p1` and `p3` are directly provided by the input.
- `cur` is a value that is less than `high`, but we don't know its exact value.
- `low` and `high` are derived from `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, but they do not directly affect the calculation of `p1 - cur + p3`.

The expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to:
\[ \text{result} = p1 + p3 - cur \]

Since `cur` is less than `high`, it will be some value less than the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. However, without knowing the exact value of `cur`, we cannot provide a specific numerical result. But we can describe the result in terms of the known quantities.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **p1 + p3 - cur**
