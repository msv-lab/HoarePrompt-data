Output State: **`ans` is `k * b`, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the usual price and the modified price of the first k buns respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of buns.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `k * b` to its current value. Since `ans` was initially 0, it now equals `k * b`. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
