### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the given code to understand why the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The loop iterates over values of \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - It increments `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\), which is not related to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The code does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
   - It does not compute the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)) for each pair \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Manual Example Check**:
   - As shown in the original assessment, the example with \(n = 10\) and \(m = 10\) demonstrates that the program incorrectly counts some pairs as valid.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. Compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) for each pair.
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Given the code provided does not follow this approach, it is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
