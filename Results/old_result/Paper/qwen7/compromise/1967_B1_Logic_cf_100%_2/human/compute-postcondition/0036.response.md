Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ans` is equal to `ans` + (n + 3) // (3 * 3)
- `b` is 3

### Loop Statement
```
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `b` is being iterated over in the range from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.

2. **Current State of Variables**:
   - `b` is currently 3.

3. **Determine Next Value of `b`**:
   - The loop will continue if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - Since `b` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than 3.
   - Therefore, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `b` will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - If `b` is currently 3, it will become 4 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.

### Final State
- `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no further operations are specified.
- `b` will be 4 in the next iteration.
- `min(n, m)` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is equal to `ans` + (n + 3) // (3 * 3), `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2**
