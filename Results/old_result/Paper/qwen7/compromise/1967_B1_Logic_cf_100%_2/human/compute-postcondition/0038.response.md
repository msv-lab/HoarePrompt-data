Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the sum of the initial value of `n` plus the terms \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).

To elaborate, starting with `ans` equal to `n` and `b` initially set to \(\min(n, m) + 2\), the loop runs as long as `b` is less than or equal to \(\min(n, m)\). For each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to it. After all iterations, `b` will be one more than \(\min(n, m)\), and `ans` will contain the sum of the initial `n` and the computed terms for each `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).

In mathematical terms, the final value of `ans` can be expressed as:
\[ \text{final\_ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left( \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right) \]

This means that `ans` will be the initial value `n` plus the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all integers `b` from 2 up to the value of \(\min(n, m)\).
