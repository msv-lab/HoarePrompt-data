Output State: `ans` is increased by the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all `b` in the range from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\).

In more detail, `ans` starts as `n` and is incremented by \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each `b` in the range from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\). The final value of `ans` will be the initial value `n` plus the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all `b` in the specified range.
