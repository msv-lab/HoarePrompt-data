Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the original list, `m` is the integer value of the second element in the original list**.

Explanation: The code snippet converts the elements of the list `[n, m]` from strings to integers. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, and `n` and `m` are now integers corresponding to the original string values they held.
