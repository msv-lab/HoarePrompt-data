Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop runs from `b = 2` to `b = min(n, m)`, inclusive.
   - For each `b` in this range, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is computed and added to `ans`.
   - After the loop, `b` is set to `min(n, m) + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it.
   - Once the loop completes, `b` is set to `min(n, m) + 1`.

3. **Final Print Statement**:
   - The print statement outputs the value of `ans`.

Given the above, the print statement will output the cumulative sum of the expressions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for every `b` starting from 2 up to the minimum value between `n` and `m`, including `min(n, m)`. After the loop, `b` is set to `min(n, m) + 1`, but this value is not directly printed.

Output: **ans (where ans is the cumulative sum of (n + b) // (b * b) for b from 2 to min(n, m), inclusive)**
