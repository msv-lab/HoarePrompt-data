Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `i`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `cur_arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop is iterating over each element in `cur_arr`, the variable `i` will take on the values of the elements in `cur_arr` one by one.

3. **Initial state of `cur_arr`**: The list `cur_arr` is given as a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`bit`, `x`, `new_arr`, `xor`, `thing1`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. They remain unchanged or are initialized within the loop body.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the list `cur_arr` because the loop will iterate over its elements. The initial value of `i` will be the first element of `cur_arr`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`**.
