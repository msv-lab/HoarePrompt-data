Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1) and the length of new_arr.**

Explanation:
- `xor` is 0, and its current bit is 1, meaning we are considering the first bit (from the right) of the binary representation of the numbers in `cur_arr`.
- `new_arr` is a list containing elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of subarrays of `cur_arr` whose XOR value in the current bit position matches the value of the current bit of `xor`. Since the current bit of `xor` is 1, `new_arr` contains the cumulative XOR of subarrays of `cur_arr` where the first bit is 1.
- The function `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` finds the maximum value in `cur_arr` considering only the bits up to `bit - 1`.
- The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
