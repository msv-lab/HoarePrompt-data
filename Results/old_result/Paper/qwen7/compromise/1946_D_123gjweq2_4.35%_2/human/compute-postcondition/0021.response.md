Functionality: **The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` as input. It processes the list based on the current bit position and returns either the length of `cur_arr`, the maximum value between the result of another call to `find_max` with the previous bit position and the length of a new list, or -1, depending on the current bit and the intermediate results.**
