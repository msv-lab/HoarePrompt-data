Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `find_max` does not properly handle the bitwise operations and conditions specified in the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  3 2
  0 0 1
  ```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the current implementation will not produce the correct result. Let's walk through the logic:

1. For the array `[0, 0, 1]` and `x = 2`, we need to find the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR of each segment is less than or equal to `2`.

2. The function `find_max` is designed to split the array into segments based on the current bit position (`bit`). However, it does not correctly handle the bitwise OR condition across multiple segments.

3. In the given implementation, the function `find_max` only considers the current bit position and does not recursively check the OR condition across multiple segments. This leads to incorrect results.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the OR condition is satisfied across all segments. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    return find_max(arr, 30, x)

def find_max(cur_arr, bit, x):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
    
    max_segments = 0
    for segment in new_arr:
        if segment >> bit & 1:
            max_segments = max(max_segments, find_max([segment], bit - 1, x))
        else:
            max_segments = max(max_segments, 1 + find_max([segment], bit - 1, x))
    
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(max_segments, len(new_arr))
    else:
        return max_segments

# Test case
print(func_1([0, 0, 1], 2))  # Expected output: 3
```

This corrected version ensures that the OR condition is checked across all segments and handles the bitwise operations correctly.
