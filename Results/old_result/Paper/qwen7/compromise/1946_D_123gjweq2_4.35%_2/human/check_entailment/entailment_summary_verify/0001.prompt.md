You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` as input. It processes the list based on the current bit position and returns either the length of `cur_arr`, the maximum value between the result of another call to `find_max` with the previous bit position and the length of a new list, or -1, depending on the current bit and the intermediate results.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number \( k \) such that we can select pairs of indices \([l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \ldots, [l_k, r_k]\) satisfying specific conditions.
   - The conditions include:
     - \( l_1 = 1 \)
     - \( r_k = n \)
     - \( l_i \le r_i \) for all \( i \)
     - \( r_i + 1 = l_{i+1} \) for all \( i \)
     - The bitwise OR of the XORs of the subarrays must be less than or equal to \( x \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The problem can be simplified by considering the bitwise representation of the elements and how they combine under XOR and OR operations.
   - The solution involves breaking down the array into segments based on the highest bit position where the XOR result is non-zero.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `find_max` with the entire array and the highest bit position (31).
   - This is a reasonable approach since it initializes the recursive function with the full array and the highest bit.

4. **Function `find_max`**:
   - This function recursively processes the array by considering each bit position.
   - It uses a list `new_arr` to store intermediate results and a variable `xor` to keep track of the cumulative XOR.
   - If the current XOR value at the current bit position is zero, it appends the current XOR value to `new_arr`.
   - If the current XOR value at the current bit position is non-zero, it sets `thing1` to -1 or continues the recursion.
   - The function then checks if the current bit position is relevant to the target value \( x \) and returns the maximum possible segments.

### Detailed Check

- **Base Case**: When `bit` becomes -1, the function returns the length of the current segment (`cur_arr`), which is correct because it means all bits have been processed.
- **Recursive Case**: The function correctly handles the splitting of the array based on the current bit position and recursively processes the new segments.
- **Bitwise Operations**: The use of bitwise operations (XOR and OR) is appropriate for the problem requirements.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases like when the XOR value at the current bit position is non-zero, ensuring the recursion continues appropriately.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the functions, the logic seems sound and correctly implements the required algorithm. The functions handle the bitwise operations and recursive segmentation appropriately.
