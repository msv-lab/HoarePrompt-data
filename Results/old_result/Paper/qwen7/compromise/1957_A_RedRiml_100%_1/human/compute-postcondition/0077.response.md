Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with key `i+1` and value `1`, `i` is `i+1`, `pl` contains the element `i+1`**.

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` was previously `i+1`, the dictionary now has a key `i+1` with the value `1`. The value of `i` is updated to `i+1`, and `pl` still contains the element `i+1`.
