Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `palka`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is a dictionary.
   - If the key `i` does not exist in `d`, it is updated with the key `i` having the value `1`.
   - If the key `i` already exists in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.
   - `pl` is a list that now contains the element `i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The variable `palka` remains unchanged unless it is modified inside the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, we assume it remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `d` and `pl` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are specified.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is incremented by 1, `pl` contains the element `i`**.

Since the exact value of `i` is not given, we can represent it as `i+1` where `i` was the value at the end of the previous iteration. 

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is `i+1`, `pl` contains the element `i+1`**.
