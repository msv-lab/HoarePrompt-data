Output State: **`d` is a dictionary. If the key `i` does not exist in `d`, then `d` is updated with the key `i` having the value `1`. If the key `i` exists in `d`, then the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. `i` is the next element in `palka`. `pl` is a list that now contains the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. The dictionary `d` is updated based on whether the key `i` already exists in `d`. If `i` does not exist, it is added with a value of `1`. If `i` already exists, its value is incremented by `1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is the next element in `palka`.
