Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing the second element of `palka`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is the second element of the list `palka`) to the list `pl`. The initial conditions remain unchanged except for the addition of `i` to `pl`.
