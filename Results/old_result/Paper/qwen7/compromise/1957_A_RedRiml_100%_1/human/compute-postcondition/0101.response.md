Output State: **`ln` is an input integer, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` such that `d[j] >= 3`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `w` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `ln = int(input())` takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `ln`. This operation does not affect the values of `shapes`, `d`, `pl`, or `w`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
