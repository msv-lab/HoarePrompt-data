Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `palka` is a list.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`.
   - `pl` is a list that contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
   - `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` such that `d[j] >= 3`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(shapes)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `shapes`:**
   - To find the value of `shapes`, we need to consider the formula: `shapes = sum(d[j] // 3 for j in pl if d[j] >= 3)`.
   - This means we need to iterate over each unique element `j` in `pl` and check if `d[j]` (the count of occurrences of `j` in `palka`) is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, we add `d[j] // 3` to the sum.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `palka = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.
     - `d = {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4: 4}` (since these are the counts of each unique element in `palka`).
     - `pl = [1, 2, 3, 4]` (unique elements in the order they first appeared).
   - For each `j` in `pl`:
     - `j = 1`: `d[1] = 1`, which is less than 3, so it doesn't contribute to the sum.
     - `j = 2`: `d[2] = 1`, which is less than 3, so it doesn't contribute to the sum.
     - `j = 3`: `d[3] = 3`, which is greater than or equal to 3, so `3 // 3 = 1` is added to the sum.
     - `j = 4`: `d[4] = 4`, which is greater than or equal to 3, so `4 // 3 = 1` is added to the sum.
   - Therefore, `shapes = 1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Given the above example, the value of `shapes` is 2.

Output: **2**
