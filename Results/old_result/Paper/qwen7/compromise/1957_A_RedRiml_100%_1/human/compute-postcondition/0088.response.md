Output State: **`shapes` is `d[j] // 3`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that must contain at least one unique element from `palka` in the order they first appeared.**

Explanation: The variable `shapes` is incremented by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. The other variables (`d` and `pl`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
