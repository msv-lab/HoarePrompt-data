You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: Output State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string if there is at least one digit, otherwise it remains -1. If the loop encounters a lowercase letter before any digit, it returns 'NO'.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string if there is at least one digit, otherwise it remains -1; the `digits` list is sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string if there is at least one digit, otherwise it remains -1; the `digits` list is sorted; the `letters` list is sorted
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`. `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The function checks the password based on certain conditions and returns 'YES' if all conditions are met, otherwise it returns 'NO'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a password string and return 'YES' under specific conditions, otherwise return 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
