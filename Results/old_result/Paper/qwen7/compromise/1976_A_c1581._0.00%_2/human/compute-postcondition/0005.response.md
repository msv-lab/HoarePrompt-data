Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string; `last_digit_index` is -1.**

The code initializes the variable `last_digit_index` to -1. This does not affect the values of `password`, `digits`, or `letters`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
