Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The function `func_1` correctly separates the password into digits and letters.
3. The function checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. The function ensures that there are no digits coming after a letter, except possibly at the end of the string.
5. The logic for checking the order of digits and letters is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the provided code correctly implements the logic to check if a password is strong according to the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
