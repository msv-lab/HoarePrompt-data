### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`. This part is correct.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The loop correctly iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `password`) for each one.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and tracking the last digit index. If such a case is found, it returns "NO".
   - It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it returns "YES".

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly verifies whether a password meets the specified conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
