Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 3, `r` must be `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to 2, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`.**
