Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be 1, `r` must be `n - 2`, `ans` is either 2 or 3, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, and `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
