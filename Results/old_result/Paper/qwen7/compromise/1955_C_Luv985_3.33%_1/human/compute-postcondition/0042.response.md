Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is now `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`**.

Explanation: The code reduces the value of `a[r]` by `mi`. Since `mi` is defined as `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, both `a[l]` (which is `a[0]`) and `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]`) are reduced by `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
