Postcondition: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is 3, `t` is k % 2, `l` must be 0 and `r` must be `n - 2` or `l` must be 1 and `r` must be `n - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, the list `a` is updated such that `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then the condition holds true.
