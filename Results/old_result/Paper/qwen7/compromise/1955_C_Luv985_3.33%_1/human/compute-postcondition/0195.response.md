Postcondition: **`T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, the list `a` is now a list of integers where `a[r]` (either `a[n-2]` or `a[n-1]`) is updated based on the condition, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged and is greater than 0, and the final value of `a[r]` is 0.**
