Postcondition: **`T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is 3, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is 1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, the list `a` is updated such that `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**
