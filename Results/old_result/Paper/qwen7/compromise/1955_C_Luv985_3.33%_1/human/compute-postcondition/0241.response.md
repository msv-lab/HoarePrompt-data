Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of ships (represented by their durabilities in a list), and a threshold value k. For each test case, the function repeatedly reduces the durabilities of the ships by their minimum value until the sum of the reductions exceeds k. It counts the number of times the durabilities are reduced and prints this count for each test case. If any ship's durability remains after processing, it checks if the remaining value is exactly equal to k. If so, it increments the count. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each test case involving up to 200,000 ships, and a threshold value k up to \(10^{15}\).**
