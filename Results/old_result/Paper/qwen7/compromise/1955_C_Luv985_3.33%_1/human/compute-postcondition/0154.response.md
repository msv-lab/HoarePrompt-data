Postcondition: **`k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `r - 1`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` (where `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`), `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is increased by 1, `t` is `k % 2`, and either `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` and `l` is increased by 1 (if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` is not 0) or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement (if `mi * 2 > k` or `a[r]` is 0).**
