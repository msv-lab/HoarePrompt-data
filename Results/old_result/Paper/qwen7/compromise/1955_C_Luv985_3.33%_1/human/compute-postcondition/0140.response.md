Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `l` must be less than `r`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, where `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged, as well as the condition that `l` must be less than `r`. Additionally, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each reduced by `mi`.
