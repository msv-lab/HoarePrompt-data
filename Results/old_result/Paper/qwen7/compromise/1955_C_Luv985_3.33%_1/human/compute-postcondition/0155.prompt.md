Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer converted from the input string, `k` is an integer converted from the input string, `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is an integer within the range `[0, n-1]`, `r` is an integer within the range `[0, n-1]`, `ans` is either `1` or `2`, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `l` is `1`, `r` is `n - 2`, the first element of `a` is `0`, and the current value of `a[r]` is `0` if `a[r]` was `0`; otherwise, the value of `a[r]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` remains `0`, `r` remains `n - 1`, `ans` is `1`, and `t` is `k % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` or remains unchanged), `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is incremented by 1 unless `a[r]` is 0, in which case `r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is either `4` or `2`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `k % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `r - 1`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` (where `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`), `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is increased by 1, `t` is `k % 2`, and either `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` and `l` is increased by 1 (if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` is not 0) or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement (if `mi * 2 > k` or `a[r]` is 0).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
