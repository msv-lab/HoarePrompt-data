Postcondition: **`ans` is incremented by `k >= a[l]`, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is equal to `r`, the list `a` has been modified such that elements at indices `l` and `r` have been reduced by their minimum value `mi` as many times as possible without violating the conditions of the loop, and `k` is non-negative and has been fully utilized as per the operations inside the loop.**
