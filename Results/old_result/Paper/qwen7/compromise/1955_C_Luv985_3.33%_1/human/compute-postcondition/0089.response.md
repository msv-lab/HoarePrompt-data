Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer converted from the input string, `k` is an integer converted from the input string, `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string in the list `a` to an integer using the `map` function and `lambda` expression. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
