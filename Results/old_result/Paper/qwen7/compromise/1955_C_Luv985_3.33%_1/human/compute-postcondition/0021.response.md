Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, the current value of `a[l]` is 0**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` is 0, so after executing this line, `l` becomes 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
