Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`, which is `a[0]` since `l` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
