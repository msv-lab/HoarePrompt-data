Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is either 1 or 2 plus 1, `mi` is now `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
