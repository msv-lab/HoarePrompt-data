Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is defined as `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
