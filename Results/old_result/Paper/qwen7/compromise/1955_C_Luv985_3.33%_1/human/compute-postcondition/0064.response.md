Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` must be `n - 2`, `ans` is equal to 2, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. Initially, `l` was set to 1. After executing `l += 1`, `l` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
