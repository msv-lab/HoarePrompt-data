Output State: **`k` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, and `no_path` is False**

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `no_path`. The values of `k` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The condition regarding `b[2]` is not relevant to the assignment of `no_path` and thus remains unchanged.
