Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a string input from the user, `n` is an input integer, and `b` is a new string input from the user. If the last two characters of `b` are not equal to '>', then `no_path` is True, `k` is set to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `b[1]` is not '>', and the value of `a[k]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, and `no_path` is a boolean. If `b[-2]` is not '>', `n` is adjusted to be the highest even number less than or equal to its initial value, `k` is either the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` or the last even number less than `n`, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `no_path` is True, `k` is the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is not '>'; if `no_path` is False, `k` is the last even number less than `n` and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is '>'.

This means that regardless of whether the condition `b[-2] != '>'` is true or false, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be adjusted according to specific rules involving even numbers and the character at the end of the string `a`. The boolean `no_path` will determine the exact value of `k` and the relationship between `k` and the last character of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` is a boolean. If `b[-2] != '>'`, the function continues with the original state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path`. If `b[-2] == '>'`, then if `n` equals 1, the function continues with the original state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path`. If `n` is greater than 4, `k` is set to `n-1`, and for all `k` in the range of the loop, `b[k]` is not `'>'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
