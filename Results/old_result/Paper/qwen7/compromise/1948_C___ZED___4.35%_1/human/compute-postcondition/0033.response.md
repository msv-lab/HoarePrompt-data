Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `k` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `b[1]` is not '>', and the current value of `a[k]` is not '>'.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `no_path` is guaranteed to be False, `k` remains 1, `n` still needs to be greater than 0, `b[1]` remains not being '>', and the value at index `k` in array `a` is not '>'.
