Postcondition: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` is a boolean. If `n` equals 1, the function continues with the original state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path`. If `n` is greater than 4, `k` is set to `n-1`, and for all `k` in the range of the loop, `b[k]` is not `'>'`.**
