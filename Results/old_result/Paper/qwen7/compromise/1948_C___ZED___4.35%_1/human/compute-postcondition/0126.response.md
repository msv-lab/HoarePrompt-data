Output State: **`no_path` is `False`, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` sets the variable `no_path` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
