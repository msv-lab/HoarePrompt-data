Postcondition: **`no_path` is True, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `k` is the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `a` is a string input by the user, and `b` is a string input by the user. If `no_path` is False, `n` remains the same, `k` is the last even number less than `n`, `a` is a string input by the user, and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is not '>', `b` is a string input by the user.**
