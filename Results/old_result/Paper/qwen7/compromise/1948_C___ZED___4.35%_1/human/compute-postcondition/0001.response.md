Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. Since the exact input is not specified, the value of `n` remains as an input integer. All other variables remain in their initial state, which in this case is not specified beyond `n`.
