Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a string input from the user.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `b` is a new string input from the user, with the condition that the last two characters of `b` are not equal to '>>'.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `a`, `n`, and `b`.

Output: **NO**
