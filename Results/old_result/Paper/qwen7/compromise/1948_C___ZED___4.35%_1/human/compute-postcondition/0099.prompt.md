Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `no_path` is True, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `k` is the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
    print(k)
    if a[k] != '>':
        no_path = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `n` must be greater than 1, the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` is assigned to `k`, `a` is a string input by the user, and the current value of `a[k]` is not '>', `b` is a string input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `n` must be greater than 1, the next even number after the current value of `k` is assigned to `k`, `a` is a string input by the user, and the current value of `a[k]` is not '>', `b` is a string input by the user. If `a[k]` is not '>', then the next even number after the current value of `k` is assigned to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `k` is updated to the next even number after its original value, and `a` is a string where the character at the new position of `k` is not '>'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
