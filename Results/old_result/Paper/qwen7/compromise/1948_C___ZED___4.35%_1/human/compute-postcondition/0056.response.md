Postcondition: `a` is a string input from the user, `n` is an input integer, and `b` is a new string input from the user. If the last two characters of `b` are not equal to '>', then the second last character of `b` is not '>', and `no_path` is True, `k` is set to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `a[k]` remains unchanged.
