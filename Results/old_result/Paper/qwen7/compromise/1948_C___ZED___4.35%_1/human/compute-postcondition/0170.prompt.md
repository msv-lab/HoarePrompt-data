You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, one of the following outputs has been printed: 'YES' or 'NO'. The variables `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated according to the loop's logic, but their final values are not specified as they depend on the input for each test case. The variable `no_path` has been determined based on the conditions inside the loop and affects the final output.
    #
    #In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the program has processed all given test cases and printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each one based on the conditions specified in the loop. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path` reflect the outcome of processing each test case, but without specific inputs, we cannot determine their exact final values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, n is even). For each test case, it reads two strings of length n, each consisting only of '<' and/or '>', and returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
