Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a string input from the user.
- `n` is an input integer with the value of 1.
- `b` is a new string input from the user.
- The second last character of `b` is not '>', which means the second last character could be any character except '>'.

The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
