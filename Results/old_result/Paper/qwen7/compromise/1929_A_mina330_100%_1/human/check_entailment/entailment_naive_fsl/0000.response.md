Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the sorting approach used. Sorting the array and taking the difference between the last and first elements only works if the array is already in a specific order where the maximum difference is achieved. However, the problem requires finding the maximum possible beauty by rearranging the elements of the array, not just sorting them.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The program's output would be `1`, but the correct output should be `1` as well, but the approach used does not guarantee this for all cases. For instance, if the array is `[3, 3, 4, 3]`, the maximum beauty is achieved by rearranging it to `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, which gives a beauty of `1`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the largest element is paired with the smallest element to maximize the differences. This can be done by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally.
