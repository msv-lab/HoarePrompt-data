Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, the problem requires maximizing the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for `i` from `2` to `n`. Sorting the array and finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not achieve this goal. Instead, to maximize the sum of these differences, we should place the largest element at one end and the smallest at the other end, ensuring the maximum difference pairs are adjacent.

To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Find the minimum and second minimum values.
2. Find the maximum and second maximum values.
3. Arrange the array such that the maximum values and minimum values alternate starting from the ends.

However, the provided solution only finds the difference between the largest and smallest values, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})`.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
