### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize this sum, we want to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements. When the array is sorted, the largest element minus the smallest element will give us the maximum possible difference, and this difference will be the maximum beauty since the differences between other consecutive elements will be minimized.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the maximum difference between the smallest and largest elements is calculated.
   - This approach guarantees the maximum possible beauty of the array because any other arrangement would result in smaller differences between some pairs of consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

**Correctness:** **True**
