### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1()` takes no parameters.
- It reads an integer \( n \) and creates a list of integers from 1 to \( n \).
- It reverses every second element in the list.
- It prints the modified list.
- The function does not return any value.

#### Program Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Permutation Generation**:
   - The function `func_1()` generates a list of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then reverses every second element in the list.

2. **Example Outputs**:
   - For \( n = 4 \), the generated permutation is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the generated permutation is `[3, 2, 1]`.

3. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - \( p_1 = 4 \) and \( p_2 = 1 \): \( 4 \) does not divide \( 1 \).
     - \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_3 = 2 \): \( 1 \) does not divide \( 2 \).
     - \( p_3 = 2 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \): \( 2 \) does not divide \( 3 \).
     - \( p_1 = 4 \) and \( p_3 = 2 \): \( 4 \) does not divide \( 2 \).
     - \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \): \( 1 \) does not divide \( 3 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - \( p_1 = 3 \) and \( p_2 = 2 \): \( 3 \) does not divide \( 2 \).
     - \( p_2 = 2 \) and \( p_3 = 1 \): \( 2 \) does not divide \( 1 \).
     - \( p_1 = 3 \) and \( p_3 = 1 \): \( 3 \) does not divide \( 1 \).

From the above analysis, the program correctly generates a permutation where no two adjacent elements \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \) satisfy the divisibility condition.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case, ensuring that no two adjacent elements in the permutation have one dividing the other.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
