Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). It then creates a list of integers from 1 to n, reverses every second element in the list, and prints the modified list. The function does not return any value.**
