Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n inclusive, the elements at even indices of `a` are reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a`. The slicing `a[::2]` selects every second element starting from index 0 (even indices), and `[::-1]` reverses these selected elements. The states of the other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged, and `a` now has its even-indexed elements reversed.
