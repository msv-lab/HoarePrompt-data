Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any of the variables' values but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no changes were made to the variables `i`, `n`, or `s`, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
