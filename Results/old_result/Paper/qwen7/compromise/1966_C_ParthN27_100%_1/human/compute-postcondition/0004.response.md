Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `s` is an empty set.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.
   - The initial value of `i` should be 0 since the loop starts counting from 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it should be 0).

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
