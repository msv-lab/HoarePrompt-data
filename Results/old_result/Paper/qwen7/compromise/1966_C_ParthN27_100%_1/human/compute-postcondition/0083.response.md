Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is 0**.

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is 1 if `s[3] - s[2] > 1` was true, otherwise `ans` remains 1 (since no specific value for `s[3]` and `s[2]` is given, we consider the previous value). The code `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1. Since XORing a number with 1 flips its bits, if `ans` was 1, it becomes 0, and if it was 0, it becomes 1. Therefore, `ans` changes from 1 to 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
