Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `arr`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that every index in the list `arr` has been processed. The set `s` will contain all unique elements from the list `arr`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was initially the length of the list `arr`, and `ans` remains 1 as it was not affected by the loop.
