Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is the result of performing XOR operation on 1 for each iteration where `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1. If `ans` is true, then `i` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 4.**
