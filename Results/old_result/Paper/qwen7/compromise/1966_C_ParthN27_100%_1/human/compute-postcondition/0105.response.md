Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `arr`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The set `s` will contain all unique elements from the list `arr` since each element is added to the set in each iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `ans` remains 1 as it is not affected by the loop.
