Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list of all unique elements from the list `arr`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. Since `s` contains all unique elements from the list `arr`, sorting it does not change its content but arranges the elements in a specific order. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
