Output State: **`i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive); `s` is a set containing `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contains `arr[i-1]`. After executing the code, `s` will contain both `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only affects the set `s`.
