Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, `ans` is `ans` XOR 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is XORed with 1. Since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, it remains as `ans ^ 1`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
