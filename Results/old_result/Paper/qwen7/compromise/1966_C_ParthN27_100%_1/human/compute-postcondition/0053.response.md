Output State: **`i` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive); `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code adds `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `i` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is a valid integer, `i` is a valid index for the list `arr`. The set `s` now contains the element `arr[i]`. The range of `i` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
