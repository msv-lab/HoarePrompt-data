Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1 + 1`, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is less than `n + 1**.

Explanation: The code snippet `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since the initial state already had `l` as `func_2() + 1`, the new value of `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
