Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `v` is the return value of `func_2()`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n, 0, -1)`.
   - This means `i` starts at `n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than 0 (since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be `n-1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.
   - `v` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

5. **Postcondition After the Loop:**
   - If `v` equals `n`, the loop would break, but since the loop continues, `v` does not change its value from the previous iteration.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` decreases by 1.
- `n` and `k` remain the same.
- `v` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.
