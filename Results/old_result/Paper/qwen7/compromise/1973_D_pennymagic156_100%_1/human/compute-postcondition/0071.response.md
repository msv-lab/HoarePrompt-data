Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `k` is `k - 3 * 0` (which simplifies to `k`)
   - `l` is `func_2() + 0` (which simplifies to `func_2()`)
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `l` is less than `n + 1`
   - `cnt` is 1
   - `l` is 1

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, both conditions in the `and` operator must be true.
   - The first condition is `cnt` which is currently 1 (true).
   - The second condition is `l < n + 1` which is currently true because `l` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer (so `n + 1` is greater than 1).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `cnt` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.
   - We need to ensure `l < n + 1` remains true. Given `l` is currently 1, `n` being a positive integer ensures this condition is met.

Since no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time based on the given conditions, we can repeat the current state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `func_2()`, `cnt` is 1, `l` is 1**
