Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `v` is the return value of `func_2()`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = n-1` down to `i = 1` (since `range(n, 0, -1)` generates numbers from `n-1` to `0` but the loop runs until `i > 0`).

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - If `v` equals `n`, the loop breaks out.
   - If `v` does not equal `n`, the conditions remain unchanged.

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 from `n-1` to `n-2`.

6. **Checking the Break Condition:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, it will be decremented to `n-2` in the next iteration.
   - The break condition (`v == n`) will still be checked in the next iteration.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `n-2`.

**Final State:**
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is now `n-2`.
- `k` remains the same.
- `v` remains the same.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-2`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.
