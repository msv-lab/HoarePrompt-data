Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`. If `v` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
