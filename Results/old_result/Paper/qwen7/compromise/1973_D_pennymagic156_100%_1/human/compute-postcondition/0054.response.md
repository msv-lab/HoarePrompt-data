Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k - 3`. Since `k` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is derived from itself minus 3.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Here, `func_2()` is a function call whose return value is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
   - `cnt` must be non-zero, meaning `cnt` is a non-zero integer.
   - `l` is less than `n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l` is less than `n + 1`.
- `v` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.

Given these points, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `l` and `i * v`. Since `i` is 1, `i * v` simplifies to `v`.

Output: **'? [func_2() + 1] [v]'**
