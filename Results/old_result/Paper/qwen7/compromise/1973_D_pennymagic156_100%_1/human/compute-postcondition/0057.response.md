Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**: We need to ensure that both parts of the condition (`cnt` and `l < n + 1`) are satisfied for the loop to execute again.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is `k - 3`
- `l` is `func_2() + 1 + 1`
- `cnt` is `cnt - 1`
- `l` is less than `n + 1`

We need to ensure:
- `cnt` is non-zero (i.e., `cnt > 0`)
- `l < n + 1` remains true

From the given information:
- `l` is already less than `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `cnt` is `cnt - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, meaning `cnt` has been decremented by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `cnt` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to set `cnt` to a value that ensures it is non-zero.

**Step-by-step adjustment**:
- Since `cnt` was decremented by 1, it must be set to a value greater than 0 to satisfy the condition `cnt > 0`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `cnt` must be greater than 0.

The final state should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1 + 1`, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `l` is less than `n + 1**
