Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `cnt` is 0**

The code `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 1, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 0. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
