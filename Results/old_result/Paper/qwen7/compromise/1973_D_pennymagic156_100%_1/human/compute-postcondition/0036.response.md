Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head conditions**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `i` is 0 (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `cnt` must be non-zero (`cnt > 0`).
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1` (`l < n + 1`).

4. **Check the current state**:
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`, and since `k` is a positive integer between 1 and `n`, `cnt` can be 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `k`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and we need to ensure that `l < n + 1`.

5. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to continue, `cnt` must be non-zero. Currently, `cnt` is `k - 2`, so `k` must be at least 3 (since `k - 2 > 0` implies `k > 2`).
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `l = func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2()` returns a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be at least 3.
- `func_2()` must return a value less than `n`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` must be at least 3, `func_2()` must return a value less than `n`, and `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
