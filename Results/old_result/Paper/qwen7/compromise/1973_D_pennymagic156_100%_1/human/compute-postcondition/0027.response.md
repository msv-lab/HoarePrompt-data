Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1**.

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `cnt` and `l`. `cnt` is assigned the value of `k`, and `l` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
