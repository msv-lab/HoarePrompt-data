Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1 + func_2() + 1`, `cnt` is non-zero**

Explanation: The line `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l`. Initially, `l` was defined as `func_2() + 1`. Now, it is updated to `func_2() + 1 + func_2() + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
