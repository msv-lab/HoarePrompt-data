Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `cnt`: The current value of `cnt` is 1.
   - `l < n + 1`: The current value of `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and the current value of `n` is a positive integer.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute**:
   - Since `cnt` is 1, the condition `cnt` is true.
   - For `l < n + 1` to be true, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `l` is currently `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2() + 1` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `l` because it directly affects the loop condition `l < n + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `l` is less than `n + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`, `cnt` is 1**
