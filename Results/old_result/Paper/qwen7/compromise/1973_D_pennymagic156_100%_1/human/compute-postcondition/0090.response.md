Output State: **i is n-1, n is a positive integer, k is 0, l is func_2() + 3*(n // k), cnt is 0 - (n // k), and either cnt is not equal to 0 or l is not equal to n + 1.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will reach `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n//k`. The variable `k` will be `0` since it decreases by `3` each time the inner loop completes a full cycle and `n // k` becomes `0` when `i` reaches `n-1`. The variable `l` will be `func_2() + 3*(n // k)` because `l` increments by `1` each time through the inner loop and the inner loop runs `n // k` times. The variable `cnt` will be `0 - (n // k)` as it decreases by `1` each time through the inner loop. Either `cnt` will not be `0` (since `n // k` is non-zero) or `l` will not be `n + 1` (since `l` will be `func_2() + 3*(n // k)` which is less than `n + 1` given the initial conditions).
