Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` must be at least 3
- `func_2()` must return a value less than `n`
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Let's break down the components:
1. `i` is explicitly given as 0.
2. `v` is not defined in the initial state, so it is unknown. We cannot determine its value.
3. `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, let's denote this returned value as `m` where `0 <= m < n`. Therefore, `l = m + 1`.

The `print` statement will output a formatted string with the values of `l` and `i * v`. Since `i` is 0, `i * v` will always be 0 regardless of the value of `v`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [l] 0' where l is func_2() + 1 and func_2() returns a value less than n**
