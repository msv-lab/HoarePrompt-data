Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `f'? 1 {i * n}'` part of the `print` statement is a formatted string where `{i * n}` will be replaced by the value of `i * n`.
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, `i * n` simplifies to `n * n`, which is \(n^2\).
   - Therefore, the formatted string becomes `'? 1 n^2'`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'? 1 n^2'`.

Output: **'? 1 n^2'**
