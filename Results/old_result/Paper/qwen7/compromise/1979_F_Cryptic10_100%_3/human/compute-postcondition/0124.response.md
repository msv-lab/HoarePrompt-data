Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is a list with one element `v1`; `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple; `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; if the last element of `p1` (which is `vx[-1]`) is equal to `v2`, then `p2` appends `v1`; otherwise, `p1` appends `v1`.**

This means that if `vx[-1]` is equal to `v2`, then `p2` will become `[v1, v1]`. Otherwise, `p1` will become a list that includes all its original elements plus `v1`.
