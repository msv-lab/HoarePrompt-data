Output State: **`ops` is equal to `[('v3', 0), ('len(vx) - 4', 0)]`, `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` does not contain `v3`, `_` is not used.**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. Since `v1` is already defined as `len(vx) - 4`, it remains unchanged. The value of `v1` is updated within the `ops` list but its original value is preserved. The other variables (`v2`, `vx`, `v3`, `_`) remain unchanged.
