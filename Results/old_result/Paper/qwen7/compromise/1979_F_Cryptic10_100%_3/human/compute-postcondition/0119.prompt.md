Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`, `p2` is a list containing all elements added during the loop executions, `v1` is undefined, `v2` is undefined.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer excluding `v1`; `v2` is another integer from `vx` excluding the last two elements. `ops` is a list. If `v2 > 0`, then `ops` contains a tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `ops` contains tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, where `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `vx` has at least 2 elements. If `v2 > 0`, then `vx` has the first element as the last but one element of the original `vx` and the second element as the last element of the original `vx`; `v2` is equal to the last but one element of the original `vx`; `v1` does not exist; `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2 <= 0`, then `vx` has the first element as `v3`, the second element as the last element of the original `vx`, and `v1` does not exist; `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `vx` has at least one element, `v2` is either the second last or the third last element of `vx` depending on the condition `v2 > 0`. If `v2 > 0`, `vx` has at least 1 element (excluding the second last element which was moved), `v2` is the second last element of `vx`, `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(None, v2)`, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. If `v2 <= 0`, `vx` has at least one less element, `v2` is the third last element of `vx`, `ops` has an additional element `(None, 0)`, and `(None, 0)` is added to `ops`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
