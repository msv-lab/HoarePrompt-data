Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to len(vx) - 5 with `v1` removed, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code appends two tuples to the `ops` list: `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. Since `v3` and `v1` are already defined in the initial state, their values remain unchanged. The `vx` set, `n`, and `t` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
