Output State: **`ops` is a list containing at least one tuple where the last element of the first tuple is updated based on the condition; `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; the first tuple in `ops` has its last element appended with `v1` if the last element of the first tuple equals `v2`, otherwise, the first tuple remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code checks if the last element of the first tuple in `ops` is equal to `v2`. If it is, then `v1` is appended to the first tuple. Otherwise, the first tuple remains unchanged. The values of `ops`, `v1`, and `v2` are updated based on this condition, while the rest of the list `ops` and the variables `v1` and `v2` retain their previous values.
