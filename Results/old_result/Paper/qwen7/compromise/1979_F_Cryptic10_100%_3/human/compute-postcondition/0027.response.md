Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` is the list with one element removed at index `v1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Since `v1` and `v2` are defined as `len(vx) - 3` and `len(vx) - 2` respectively, and `vx` is a list with one element removed at index `v1`, the only change is that `ops` now contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, and the state of `vx` also remains the same as described in the initial state.
