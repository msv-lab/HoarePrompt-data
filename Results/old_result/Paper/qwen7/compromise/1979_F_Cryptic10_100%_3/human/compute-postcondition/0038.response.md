Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the list `ops[::-1]`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops[::-1]`. This means the loop starts from the last tuple in `ops` and moves towards the first tuple.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple where the last element of the first tuple is updated based on the condition (if the last element of the first tuple is equal to `v2`, then append `v1` to the first tuple, otherwise the first tuple remains unchanged).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, the next tuple to be processed would be the one before the last tuple processed in the previous iteration.
   - The list `ops` itself does not change; it still contains at least one tuple.
   - The variables `v1` and `v2` will be the first elements of the next tuple in the reversed list.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `ops` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- The next tuple in `ops[::-1]` will be the one before the last tuple processed, so `v1` and `v2` will be the first and second elements of that tuple, respectively.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ops` is a list containing at least one tuple where the last element of the first tuple is updated based on the condition (if the last element of the first tuple is equal to `v2`, then append `v1` to the first tuple, otherwise the first tuple remains unchanged), `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`, `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`**.
