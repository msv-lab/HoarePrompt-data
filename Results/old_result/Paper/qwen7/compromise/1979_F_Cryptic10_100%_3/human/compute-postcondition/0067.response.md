Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `len(vx) > 2`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`
   - `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`
   - `vx` has had its `v1` element removed.
   - If `v2 > 0`, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`.
   - Otherwise, `ops` is equal to `[('v3', 0), ('len(vx) - 4', 0)]`, `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` does not contain `v3`, and `_` is not used.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `len(vx)` must be greater than 2. After the previous iteration, `vx` has had its `v1` element removed, so `len(vx)` is now `len(vx) - 1`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `vx` has had its `v1` element removed, `len(vx)` is now `len(vx) - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(vx) - 1` must be greater than 2, which means `len(vx)` must be greater than 3.
   - Therefore, `vx` must have at least 4 elements before the removal of `v1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(vx)` is greater than 3.
   - The values of `v1` and `v2` are derived from `len(vx)`, so they will automatically update as `len(vx)` changes.
   - The state of `ops` does not affect the loop condition directly, so no adjustment is needed for `ops`.

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `len(vx)` is greater than 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` has had its `v1` element removed, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 3**.
