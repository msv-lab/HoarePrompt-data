Postcondition: `vx` has at least one less element, `v2` is now either the second last or the third last element of `vx` depending on whether the condition `v2 > 0` is true or false. If `v2 > 0` is true, `v2` remains the second last element, and `v3` can be any value. If `v2 > 0` is false, `v2` becomes the third last element. Additionally, `ops` is updated accordingly: it contains a tuple `(None, v2)` if the condition is true, and has an additional element `(None, 0)` if the condition is false.
