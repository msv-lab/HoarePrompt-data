Output State: **`ops` now contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` as its last element; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) excluding `v1`; `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`; the current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Since `ops` was partially processed in reverse order before this line, the new tuple is added as the last element in the reversed order. The values of `vx`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
