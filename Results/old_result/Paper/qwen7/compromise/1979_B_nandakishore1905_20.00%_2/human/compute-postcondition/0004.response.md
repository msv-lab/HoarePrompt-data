Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\), and then prints one of four possible values based on specific conditions involving \(k\): \(k\), \(1\), \(2\), or \(k - q\), where \(q\) is derived from the binary representation of \(k\). The function does not return any value but outputs these results for each test case.**
