The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case includes a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each string `s`, it checks if the string has a length of 1 or consists of the same character repeated. If either condition is met, it prints "No". Otherwise, it generates a random permutation of the characters in `s` and prints "Yes" followed by this permutation.
