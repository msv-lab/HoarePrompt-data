You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case includes a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each string `s`, it checks if the string has a length of 1 or consists of the same character repeated. If either condition is met, it prints "No". Otherwise, it generates a random permutation of the characters in `s` and prints "Yes" followed by this permutation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the string consists of more than one unique character but still cannot produce a different string. For example, consider the input "codeforces". The program generates a random permutation of the string, which could potentially result in the same string being returned. In such cases, the program should output "NO" since no valid rearrangement exists that is different from the original string.

To fix this, the program should ensure that if a valid rearrangement exists, it returns it; otherwise, it should output "NO". Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            if s != s2:
                print('YES')
                print(s2)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This version ensures that if a valid rearrangement exists, it is returned; otherwise, "NO" is printed.
