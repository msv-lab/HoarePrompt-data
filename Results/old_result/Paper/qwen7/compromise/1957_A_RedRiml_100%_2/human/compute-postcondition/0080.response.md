Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list with two additional elements which are `i`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. The values of `palka`, `i`, `pl`, and the other elements of `d` remain unchanged from their initial states.
