Output State: **`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for each `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `shapes` will hold the total of `d[j] // 3` for every `j` in the list `pl` that satisfies the condition `d[j] >= 3`.
