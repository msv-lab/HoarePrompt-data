Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `shapes` is `0 + d[j] // 3 + d[j] // 3`
   - `j` is the first element of `pl`
   - The value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `pl`.
   - The loop variable is `j`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `pl`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `j` is the first element of `pl` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the second element of `pl`.
   - The value of `d[j]` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `shapes` remains unchanged because it is computed based on the current `j`, and `j` changes to the next element in `pl`.
   - `j` changes to the second element of `pl`.
   - The condition for `d[j]` remains the same (greater than or equal to 3).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`shapes` is `0 + d[j] // 3 + d[j] // 3`, `j` is the second element of `pl`, and the value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3**
