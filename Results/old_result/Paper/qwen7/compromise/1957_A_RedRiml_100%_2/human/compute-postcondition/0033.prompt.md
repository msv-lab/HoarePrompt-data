Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in the list `pl`, then `i` is added as a key in the dictionary and its value is set to 1. If `i` is already in the dictionary, its value is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary, and `i` is the next element in the list `palka`. If the key `i` does not exist in the dictionary `d`, then it is added with a value of `1`. If the key `i` already exists in the dictionary `d`, its value is incremented by `1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `d` is a dictionary where if the key `i` does not exist, it is updated with the key `i` having the value `1`; if the key `i` already exists, its value is incremented by `1`; `i` is the next element in the list `palka`; `pl` is a list containing the elements of `palka` up to the current element `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
