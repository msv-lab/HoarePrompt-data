Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list with two additional elements which are `i`, and `d[i]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of `d[i]` to 1. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
