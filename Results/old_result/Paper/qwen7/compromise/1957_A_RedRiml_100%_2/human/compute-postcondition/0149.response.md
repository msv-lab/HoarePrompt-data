Postcondition: `shapes` is `0 + d[j] // 3 + d[j] // 3 + d[j] // 3`, where `j` is the second element of `pl`, and the value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3. This is because the if condition ensures that `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` three times, and there is no else part to alter this value.
