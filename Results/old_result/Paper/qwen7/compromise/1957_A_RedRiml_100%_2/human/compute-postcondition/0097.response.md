Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` and the sequence `pl`. The key variables here are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the bounds of `pl`. Since `j` starts from 0 (as it is a typical range-based loop), the loop will continue as long as `j < len(pl)`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 3.
   - `j` is 2.
   - The current value of `d[2]` is greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 3.
   - The condition `j < len(pl)` must still hold true for the loop to continue. Given that `j` is currently 2, `len(pl)` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `d[2]` remains unchanged as there is no indication that it should change within the loop head.
   - `shapes` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`shapes` is 3, `j` is 3, and the current value of `d[2]` is greater than or equal to 3.**
