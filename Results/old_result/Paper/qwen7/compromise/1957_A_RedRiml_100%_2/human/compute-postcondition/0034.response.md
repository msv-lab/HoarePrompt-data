Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with counts of elements from `palka`, `pl` contains unique elements from `palka` in their first appearance order.**

The code `shapes = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `shapes`. This does not affect the dictionaries `d` or the list `pl`, which are assumed to be initialized based on the previous state. Therefore, `d` retains its state as a dictionary with counts of elements from `palka`, and `pl` remains a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
