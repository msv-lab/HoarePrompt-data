Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` from the list `palka`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**: 
   - `i` is the first element of `palka`.
   - `palka` is a list of integers.
   - `shapes` is 6.
   - `w` is greater than 0.
   - `ln` is an input integer.
   - `pl` is a list containing `i`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where the value of `i` is incremented by 1 if it was initially `None`, or set to 1 if it was not `None`.

3. **Understand what happens during each iteration**:
   - `i` takes the value of the first element of `palka`.
   - `pl` is updated to contain `i`.
   - `d` is updated based on the value of `i`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` will now be the second element of `palka`.
   - `pl` will contain the second element of `palka`.
   - `d` will be updated based on the second element of `palka`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be the second element of `palka`.
   - `pl` will contain the second element of `palka`.
   - `d` will be updated based on the second element of `palka`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the second element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the second element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where the value of the second element of `palka` is incremented by 1 if it was initially `None`, or set to 1 if it was not `None`**.
