Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `j` and the object `pl`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `shapes` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `d` is a dictionary with counts of elements from `palka` (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `pl` contains unique elements from `palka` in their first appearance order.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `pl` is not empty. If `pl` is an empty list, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `pl` being non-empty, we need to ensure that `pl` has at least one element. The other variables (`j` and `d`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `pl` having at least one element.

**State: **`pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 1 element**
