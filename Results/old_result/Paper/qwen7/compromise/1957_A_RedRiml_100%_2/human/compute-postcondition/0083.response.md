Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list with one additional element `i`, and `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on its current value.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. The initial state of `palka` and `d[i]` remains unchanged. The variable `i` itself is not modified by this operation, but `pl` now contains an additional element `i`.
