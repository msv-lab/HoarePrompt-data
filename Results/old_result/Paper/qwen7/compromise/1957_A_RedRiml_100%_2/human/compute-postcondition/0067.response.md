Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with `i` appended, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1.**

The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `palka`. Since `d[i]` was set to 1 because `i` was not in `d`, this relationship remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being added to `palka` and `d[i]` still being 1.
