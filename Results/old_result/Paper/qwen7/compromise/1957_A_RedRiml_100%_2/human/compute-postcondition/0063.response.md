Postcondition: `palka` is a list of integers and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` is `None`, then `d` is updated such that the value associated with key `i` becomes `1`, and the values associated with other keys remain `None`. If `d.get(i)` is not `None`, then `d` is updated such that the value associated with key `i` is incremented by `1`.
