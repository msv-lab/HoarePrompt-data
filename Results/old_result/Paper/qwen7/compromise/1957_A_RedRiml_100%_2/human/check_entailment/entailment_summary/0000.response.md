Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of equilateral triangles (which are a type of polygon) that can be formed from the given stick lengths. However, the problem asks for the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, not just equilateral triangles. The program only considers triangles and does not account for other possible polygons like squares, pentagons, etc., which can also be formed using the sticks.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the possibility of forming different types of regular polygons (e.g., squares, pentagons, hexagons, etc.) and determine the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed without reusing any sticks.

Given this analysis, the current implementation is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
