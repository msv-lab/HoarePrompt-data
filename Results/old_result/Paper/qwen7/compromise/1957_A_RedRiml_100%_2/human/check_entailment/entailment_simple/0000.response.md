### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick and no stick can be used more than once.

2. **Function Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `w`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `palka`.

3. **Data Structures**:
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is used to store unique stick lengths.

4. **Counting Valid Polygons**:
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, the code checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`).
   - If so, it adds the number of complete polygons that can be formed (`d[j] // 3`) to `shapes`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all sticks for a test case, the function prints the total number of polygons `shapes`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for counting the number of polygons is correct. The key steps are:
  - Counting the occurrences of each stick length.
  - Checking if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length to form a polygon.
  - Dividing the count by 3 to determine the number of polygons that can be formed.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
