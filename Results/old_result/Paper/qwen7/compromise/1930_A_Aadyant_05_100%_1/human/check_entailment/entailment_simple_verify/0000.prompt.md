You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []

        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all its iterations will be as follows:
    #
    #- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, as it was not affected by the loop.
    #- `n` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, as it was not modified inside the loop.
    #- `final` is a list that contains the sum of every second element from each `list2` created during the loop's iterations, starting from the first element of each `list2`. This means `final` will contain the sum of every second element from the first `list2`, then the sum of every second element from the second `list2`, and so on, for all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #This output state reflects the cumulative sum of every second element from each `list2` created during the loop's execution, with the sums being stored in the `final` list.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: `final` is an empty list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum final score. Specifically, the program reads inputs incorrectly and does not handle the problem as described.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads `n` as a string and then attempts to iterate over it as if it were an integer range. This is incorrect because `n` should be used directly as an integer without creating a range.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Score**: The program sorts the list of numbers but then sums every other element starting from the first element. This approach does not always yield the maximum possible score. For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Sorting gives `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and summing every other element starting from the first (`1 + 3`) results in `4`. However, the optimal solution would be to pair `1` with `2` and `3` with `4`, resulting in a score of `3`.

To fix this, the program should sort the list and then sum the minimum of each pair of consecutive elements. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        numbers = list(map(int, data[index:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        
        numbers.sort()
        score = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the input and calculates the maximum score correctly by pairing the smallest available numbers in each iteration.
