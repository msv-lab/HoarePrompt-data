Output State: **`list1` is not empty and has one less element, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` now contains three elements which are the integer representations of `a`, the next element in `list1`, and the integer representation of `str`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `str` is the next element in `list1`**.

Explanation: The code `list2.append(int(str))` appends the integer conversion of the next element in `list1` (which is `str`) to `list2`. Since `list2` originally contained two elements (`a` and the next element in `list1`), after appending the integer conversion of `str`, `list2` now contains three elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
