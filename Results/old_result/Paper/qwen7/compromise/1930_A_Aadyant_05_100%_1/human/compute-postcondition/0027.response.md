Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` from index 0 to the last index (inclusive if the length is odd, exclusive otherwise).
- `i` is `2 * len(list2)`.
- `total` is `s`.
- `final` is a list containing `s`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for num in range(int(n)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `num`.
   - The loop runs for `int(n)` iterations.
   - The loop does not directly modify `s`, `i`, `total`, or `final`.

2. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop does not modify `s`, `i`, `total`, or `final`, these values remain the same.
   - The only thing that changes is the value of `num` as it increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the current value.
   - In the next iteration, `num` will be incremented by 1.

### New State:
- `s` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `total` remains the same.
- `final` remains the same.
- `num` is incremented by 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` from index 0 to the last index (inclusive if the length is odd, exclusive otherwise), `i` is `2 * len(list2)`, `total` is `s`, `final` is a list containing `s`, `num` is `i + 1`**.
