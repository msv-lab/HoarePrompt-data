Output State: **`final` is an empty list.**

Natural Language Description: Given that the loop iterates over the elements of the `final` list and `final` starts as an empty list, the loop does not have any elements to iterate over even once. Therefore, after the loop executes all possible iterations (which in this case is zero), `final` remains an empty list. No changes occur to the `final` list throughout the loop's execution because there are no elements to process.
