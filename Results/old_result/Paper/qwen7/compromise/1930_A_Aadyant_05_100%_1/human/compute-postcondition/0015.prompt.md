Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is an input string, `list1` is equal to the split result of `b`, `b` is an input string
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `list1` is not empty, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is now containing one element which is the integer representation of `a`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `list1` is not empty, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` now contains two elements which are the integer representations of `a` and `str`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `list1` is not empty and has one less element, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` now contains three elements which are the integer representations of `a`, the next element in `list1`, and the integer representation of `str`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `str` is the next element in `list1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
