Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `list1` is an empty list, `list2` is a sorted list containing all the integer representations of the strings originally in `list1`.**

Explanation: The code `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. Since `list1` was emptied during the loop, and `list2` contains all the integer representations of the strings originally in `list1`, sorting `list2` will arrange these integers in ascending order. The variables `b` and `list1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
