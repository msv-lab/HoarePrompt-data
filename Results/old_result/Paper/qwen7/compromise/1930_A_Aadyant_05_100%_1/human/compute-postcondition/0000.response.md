Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code `n = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial value of `t` was an integer between 1 and 5000, and there's no operation changing `t`, `t` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is now assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is expected to be an integer between 1 and 50.
