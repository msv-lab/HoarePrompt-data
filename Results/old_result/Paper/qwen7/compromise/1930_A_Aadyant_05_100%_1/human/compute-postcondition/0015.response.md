Output State: **`list2` now contains all the integer representations of the elements in `list1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `list2` will contain every element from `list1` converted to integers. The loop iterates over each element in `list1`, converting it to an integer and appending it to `list2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `s`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
