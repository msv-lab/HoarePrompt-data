Output State: `b` is a non-empty string, `list1` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing all the integer representations of the strings originally in `list1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `list1` will be empty because each iteration removes one element from `list1`. Meanwhile, `list2` will contain all the integer representations of the strings that were originally in `list1`, as each string in `list1` was converted to an integer and appended to `list2` during each iteration of the loop.
