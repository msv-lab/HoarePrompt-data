Output State: **`total` is 0 + int(`list2[0]`), `i` is 4, `s` is int(`list2[0]`)**

Explanation: The initial state has `total` as 0 + int(`list2[0]`), `i` as 3, and `len(list2)` being at least 1. The code updates `s` by adding `int(list2[i])` to `s`. Since `i` was 3, `s` is updated to `int(list2[3])`. Given that `total` is initially 0 + int(`list2[0]`), and `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is 4. Therefore, `s` is now equal to `int(list2[0])`.
