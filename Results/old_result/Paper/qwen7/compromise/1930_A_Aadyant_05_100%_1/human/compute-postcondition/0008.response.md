Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is an input string, `list1` is equal to the split result of `b`, `b` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace and assigns the resulting list to `list1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
