Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for str in list1:`. The objects involved here are `str`, `list1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `list1` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b`.
   - `str` is the variable used to iterate over each element in `list1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `list1` contains at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `list1` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b`, the state of `b` is crucial. For the loop to execute, `b` must be a non-empty string, ensuring that `list1` is not empty.
   - The state of `str` is irrelevant for determining if the loop can execute, as it will be set to each element of `list1` during the loop iterations.

5. **Consider the other given states**:
   - `s` is 0, which is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `num` is the previous value of `num` incremented by 1, but this is not mentioned in the loop head and thus does not affect the loop execution.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is the state of `b` to ensure `list1` is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b` is a non-empty string, list1 is a list of strings obtained by splitting b**
