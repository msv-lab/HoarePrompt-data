Output State: **`i` is equal to `2 * (len(list2) - 1)`, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from the first element, and `final` contains the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from the first element.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `s` to the list `final`. Here, `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from the first element. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `s` being added to `final` and `i` remaining as `2 * (len(list2) - 1)`.
