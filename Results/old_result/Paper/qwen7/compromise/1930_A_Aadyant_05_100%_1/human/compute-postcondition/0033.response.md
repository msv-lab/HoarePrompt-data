Output State: **`s` is 0, `num` is the previous value of `num` incremented by 1, `list1` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b`, `b` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the input string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace by default. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it was initialized to 0. The value of `num` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but the exact numerical value is not specified since it depends on the initial value of `num`. The list `list1` is now populated with the substrings obtained from splitting `b`.
