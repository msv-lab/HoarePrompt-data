Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` will start at `n - k` and increment by 1 until it reaches `n`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to a value such that `i < n`.

4. **Initial values in the given state**:
   - `soma_b` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `lista_B` is a list of integers.
   - `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_A` up to index `i` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `n-k-1`.
   - `resultado` is `float('inf')`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n - k`, we need to ensure that `n - k` is a valid starting point for the loop, meaning `n - k` should be less than `n`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, so it must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to run at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n`, `k`, and `i`. Specifically, `i` should be initialized to `n - k`, and `n - k` should be less than `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`soma_b` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is `n - k`, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers, `lista_B` is a list of integers, `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_A` up to index `i` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `n-k-1`, and `resultado` is `float('inf')`**
