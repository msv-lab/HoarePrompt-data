Output State: `soma_b` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of n integers, `lista_B` is a list of integers, `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_A` up to index `i` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `n-k-1`, and `pref` is also incremented by `soma_b` whenever the condition is met.
