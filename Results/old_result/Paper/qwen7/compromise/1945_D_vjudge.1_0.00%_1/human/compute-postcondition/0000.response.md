Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer where 1 ≤ `numero_testes` ≤ 10^4, and we have read `numero_testes` from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer value for `numero_testes` from the input, which means `numero_testes` now holds the number of test cases. The precondition that `numero_testes` is an integer within the specified range remains valid, and we have consumed one input for `numero_testes`.
