### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues in the provided code and verify why the original assessment is correct.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:

1. **Reversing Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed using `reverse()`. This is incorrect because the problem states that the queue is ordered from the front (position 1) to the back (position n). Reversing these lists means that the first element in the reversed list corresponds to the last person in the queue, which is not what we need.

2. **Cost Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the cost of moving through intermediate positions. Specifically, it does not properly handle the cumulative cost of moving past multiple people.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Keep the lists in their original order.
2. Calculate the cumulative cost of moving past intermediate positions correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the cost to move to the first position in the range [n-k+1, n]
    resultado = float('inf')
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    
    # Calculate the cost to move from the last position to the first position in the range [n-k+1, n]
    for i in range(n - 1, n - k - 1, -1):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to move to the first position in the range [n-k+1, n]
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
    
    print(resultado)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Original Input Handling**:
   - `n, k = map(int, input().split())`: Correctly reads the number of people and the maximum allowable final position.
   - `lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads the list of costs to move past each person.
   - `lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads the list of costs to move past each person when moving forward.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - We initialize `resultado` to infinity and `soma_b` to 0.
   - We iterate from the last position to the position just before `n - k` to calculate the cumulative cost of moving past intermediate positions.
   - We then iterate from `n - k` to `n` to find the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `m` positions.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem due to the incorrect handling of the lists and the flawed cost calculation logic. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
