Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` takes the value at index `idx` in the `data` list, which is `0`, and converts it to an integer using `int()`. After this conversion, `t` holds the integer value from `data[0]`, and `idx` is incremented by 1 to point to the next element in the list. The other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
