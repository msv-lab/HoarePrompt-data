### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
- The function `func_1` currently checks if the array can be split and rearranged to match its sorted version, which is not the correct logic for the problem.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if there exists a substring in the concatenated array (`a + a`) that matches the sorted version of `a`.
- This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that the array can be split and swapped to form a non-decreasing sequence.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the concatenation of the second part followed by the first part results in a non-decreasing sequence.
- This requires iterating through possible splits and checking the resulting sequences.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- However, since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that `func_1` is incorrect and provides a detailed explanation.
- The assessment suggests that the function needs a more complex logic to check if the array can be split and swapped to form a non-decreasing sequence.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
