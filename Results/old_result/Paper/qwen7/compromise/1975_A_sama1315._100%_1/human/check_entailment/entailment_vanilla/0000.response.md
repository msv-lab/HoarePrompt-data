Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
1. **Purpose**: This function checks if the array `a` can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
2. **Steps**:
   - Calculate the length of the array `n`.
   - Create a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
   - Concatenate the original array with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - Iterate through all possible splits of `concatenated_a` and check if any split matches `sorted_a`.

**Issue**:
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting and swapping parts of the array. Instead, it checks if any part of the concatenated array matches the sorted array, which is not the intended operation.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
1. **Purpose**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. **Steps**:
   - Read all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Parse the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the size of each array `n`, and the elements of each array.
   - For each test case, call `func_1` and store the result.
   - Print the results for all test cases.

**Issue**:
- While the input parsing logic in `func_2` is correct, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

### Correct Solution
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. A correct approach would involve checking if there exists a split point such that the left part is non-decreasing and the right part is non-decreasing, and the right part is greater than or equal to the left part at the split point.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[:i] <= a[i:]:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
