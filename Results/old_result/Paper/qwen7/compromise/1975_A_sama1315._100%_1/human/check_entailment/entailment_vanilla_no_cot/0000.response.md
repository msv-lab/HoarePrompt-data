Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The `func_1` function checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by concatenating the array with itself and then checking for a subarray that matches the sorted version of the original array. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting and swapping parts of the array.
- The `func_2` function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases, but it relies on `func_1`, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements.
- To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if the array can be split and swapped in such a way that it becomes non-decreasing. A more appropriate approach would be to check if the array is already non-decreasing or if there exists a split point where the left part is non-decreasing and the right part is non-decreasing, and the last element of the left part is less than or equal to the first element of the right part.
