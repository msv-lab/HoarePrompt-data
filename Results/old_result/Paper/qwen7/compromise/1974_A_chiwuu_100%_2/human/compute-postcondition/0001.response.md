Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This information is not directly relevant to the loop execution but might be useful for context.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` at the start of the loop is not specified, so we assume it is set to the starting value of the `range` function, which is 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it is typically set to 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
