Postcondition: `d` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split, `b` is a list of integers from the new input split, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is 3, `count_b` is 4 if `b[1] <= k` and 3 otherwise, `i` is 3.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `len_b > i + 1` is true, then `count_b` changes to 4 if `b[1] <= k` and 3 otherwise. If the condition is false, `count_b` remains unchanged at 3. All other variables retain their original values as per the precondition.
