Postcondition: **`d` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split, `b` is a list of integers from the new input split, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is 3, `count_b` is 3 if `b[1] <= k` and 2 otherwise, `i` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after the if-else block executes. If the condition `len_a > i + 1` is true, `count_b` will be incremented by 1 if `b[1] <= k`. Otherwise, `count_b` remains 2. In both cases, `count_a` is 3, `i` is 2, and the other variables retain their respective states as described.
