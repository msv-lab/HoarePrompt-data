Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from another input string split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes another input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
