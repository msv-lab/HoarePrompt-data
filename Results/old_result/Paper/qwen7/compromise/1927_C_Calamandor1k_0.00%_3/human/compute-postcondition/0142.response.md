To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions in the `print` statement:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `d = k // 2`: `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the new input split.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split.
   - `b` is updated to a list of integers from the new input split.
   - `len_a` is the length of list `a`.
   - `len_b` is the length of list `b`.
   - `count_a` is the total number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - `count_b` is the total number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - `i = max(len_a, len_b)`: `i` is the maximum of the lengths of lists `a` and `b`.
   - `t = 1`: `t` is initialized to 1.

2. **Condition in the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `count_a >= d` and `count_b >= d`.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

Given these details, the key variables to focus on are `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d`. The `print` statement will evaluate the boolean expression `count_a >= d and count_b >= d`.

Since the exact values of `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d` are not explicitly provided, we need to consider the logical outcome based on the conditions:

- If `count_a` is greater than or equal to `k // 2` and `count_b` is also greater than or equal to `k // 2`, then the condition will be true, and `'YES'` will be printed.
- Otherwise, `'NO'` will be printed.

Thus, the output depends on the specific values of `count_a` and `count_b` relative to `d`. Without the actual values, we can only describe the general logic.

Output: **'YES' if the number of elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` are each greater than or equal to `k // 2`; otherwise, 'NO'**
