Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is len(lst), `over_sum` is (j - i + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is len(lst), `sm` is (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is defined as `(j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` now holds the same value as `(j - i + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
