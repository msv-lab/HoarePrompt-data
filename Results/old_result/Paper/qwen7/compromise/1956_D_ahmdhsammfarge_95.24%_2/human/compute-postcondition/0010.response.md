Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `i`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, and `sm` is sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - 0 + 1).
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop starts from `j = i + 1`, which means `j` starts from 1.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < len(lst)`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was the last value it took, which is `len(lst) - 1` because the loop starts from `i + 1` (which is 1) and goes up to `len(lst) - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become `len(lst)`.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `r` and `l` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.
   - `over_sum` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `sm` will be recalculated for the new value of `j`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `i` (though `i` remains unchanged).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(lst)`**.
