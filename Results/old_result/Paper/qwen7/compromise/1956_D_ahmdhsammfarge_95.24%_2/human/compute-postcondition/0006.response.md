Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, `sm` is sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - 0 + 1), and `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l` respectively. However, since the values of `i` and `j` are not provided, they remain as `0`. The other variables (`over_sum`, `sm`) and their conditions are not affected by this assignment, so they remain as initially stated.
