Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `i`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `len(lst)`. This means that `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`.
3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1` and that `j` is initialized correctly.

Given the initial states:
- `r` is 0
- `l` is 0
- `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`
- `i` is 0
- `lst` must have at least one element

We need to adjust the states of `i` and `j` to ensure the loop can execute.

Since `i` is initially 0, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. Given that `lst` must have at least one element, `len(lst)` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` (which is 0) is indeed less than `len(lst) - 1` as long as `len(lst)` is greater than 1.

For `j`, it is initialized to `i + 1` at the start of each iteration. Since `i` is 0, `j` will be 1 on the first iteration, which is valid as long as `len(lst)` is greater than 1.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be less than `len(lst) - 1`
- `j` will be `i + 1`, so it will be 1 on the first iteration, which is valid if `len(lst)` is greater than 1

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, `lst` must have at least 2 elements**
