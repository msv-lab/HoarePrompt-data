Output State: **`r` is [0, len(lst) + 1], `l` is the length of `lst`, `over_sum` is (j - i + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is len(lst) + 1, `sm` is (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `j - i + 1` to `over_sum` and `sm`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(lst) + 1`, the expression `j - i + 1` evaluates to `len(lst) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
