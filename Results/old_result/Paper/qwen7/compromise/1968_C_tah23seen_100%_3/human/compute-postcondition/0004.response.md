Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[n-2]` which is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, `i` is n - 3**

Explanation: The variable `i` is decremented by 1. Initially, `i` was `n - 2`. After executing `i -= 1`, the new value of `i` is `n - 3`. All other variables (`arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
