Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, ans is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list of `n` elements, where each element is set to `10 ** 9`. The length of `ans` is `n`, which is consistent with the initial state of `arr` being a list of `n-1` integers. The values of `arr` remain unchanged, while `ans` is updated with the specified values.
