Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates through each test case, reading `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `arr` and `n` as arguments.
   - The result of `func_1` is stored in `ans`, and the values are printed.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `ans` is initialized with `10^9` for all indices.
   - The loop starts from `n-2` and goes down to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.

### Checking the Logic

To verify the correctness, let's check if the logic in `func_1` meets the requirements:

- **Initial Values**: 
  - `ans` is initialized to `[10^9, 10^9, ..., 10^9]`. This ensures that the initial value of `a_i` is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition for the first few steps.

- **Backward Calculation**:
  - The loop starts from `n-2` and goes down to `0`.
  - For each `i`, `ans[i]` is set to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.
  - This ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true because `a_i` is derived from `a_{i+1}` and `x_i`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `arr = [2, 4, 1]`
  - `n = 4`
  - Initial `ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`
  - After processing:
    - `ans[2] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`
    - `ans[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995`
    - `ans[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993`
  - Result: `[999999993, 999999995, 999999999, 1000000000]`

However, this does not match the expected output `[3, 5, 4, 9]`. Let's re-evaluate the logic.

### Corrected Logic

The provided solution does not directly match the required conditions. Instead, we should ensure that `a_i` is chosen such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. A simpler approach would be to set `a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}`.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly implement the logic to find `a_i` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
