Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

For the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The expected output is an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2`
- `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4`
- `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1`

The provided solution generates:
```
ans = [10 ** 9] * n
i = n - 2
while i >= 0:
    ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
    i -= 1
```

This approach does not guarantee that the generated `a_i` values will satisfy the modulo condition. For instance, if we start with `a_1 = 10^9`, `a_2 = 10^9 - 2`, `a_3 = 10^9 - 6`, and so on, it is highly unlikely that these values will satisfy the required modulo conditions for all `x_i`.

A correct approach would involve generating values for `a_i` such that the modulo conditions are met. One possible correct implementation could be:
```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
    ans[0] = max(ans[1] + arr[0], 1)
    return ans
```

However, even with this corrected logic, there might still be edge cases where the generated `a_i` values do not satisfy the conditions perfectly due to the constraints. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect for the given problem description.
