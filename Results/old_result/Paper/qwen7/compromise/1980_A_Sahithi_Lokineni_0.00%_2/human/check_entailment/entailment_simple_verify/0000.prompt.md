You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():

            ans = ans + m - d[val]
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] <= m:
            ans = ans + m - d[val]
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5. The string a consists of n characters, each character being one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G'.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round has at least one problem of each difficulty level. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the number of rounds `m` can be greater than the number of distinct difficulty levels present in the input string `s`. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

The program outputs:
```
2
5
1
```

However, the correct outputs should be:
- For the first test case, since `m = 1`, we need at most 2 additional problems (one 'A' and one 'F').
- For the second test case, since `m = 2`, we need at least 5 additional problems (one 'A', one 'E', one 'F', and two more problems to cover the remaining rounds).
- For the third test case, since `m = 1` and we only need one problem, no additional problems are needed.

The program fails to handle the scenario where `m` is greater than the number of unique difficulty levels in the input string. It incorrectly calculates the number of additional problems needed without considering the requirement that each round must have at least one problem of each difficulty level.
