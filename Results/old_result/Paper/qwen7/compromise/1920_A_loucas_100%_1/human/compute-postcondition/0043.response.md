Postcondition: **`iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input, `big` contains all the values of `a` where `x == 1` was true, `less` contains all the values of `a` where `x == 2` was true, `no` contains all the values of `a` where `x != 2` was true, and `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. The current value of `num` is less than 1.**
