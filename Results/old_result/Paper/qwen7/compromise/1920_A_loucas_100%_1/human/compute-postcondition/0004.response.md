Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is an input integer, `iterable` must be within the range defined by `loop` (i.e., 0 ≤ iterable < loop), `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**

The code `no = []` initializes an empty list named `no`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged.
