Postcondition: `no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is decremented by 1. If the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` is true, then `no` remains unchanged in terms of its content, but `num` is decreased by 1. If the condition is false, `no` remains unchanged in terms of its content, and `num` is also unchanged.
