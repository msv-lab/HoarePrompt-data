Output State: **`num` is 0, `no` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `less` is a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input.**

Explanation: The code `less.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. Since `less` was initially a list containing `a` or is empty, after appending `a`, `less` now contains `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
