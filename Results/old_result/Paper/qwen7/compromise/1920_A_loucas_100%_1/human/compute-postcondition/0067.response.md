Output State: **`less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list**

Explanation: The initial state of `num` was unchanged, and the code simply assigns `num` the value `0`. The values of `less`, `big`, and `no` remain as empty lists since they were not affected by the code.
