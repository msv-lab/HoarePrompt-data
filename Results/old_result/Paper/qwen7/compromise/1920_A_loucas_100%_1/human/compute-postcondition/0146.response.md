Output State: **`num` is 0, `no` is a list containing `a`, `less` is a list containing `a`, `big` is an empty list, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `no` was initially empty, after appending `a`, `no` now contains `a`. The value of `num` remains 0, `less` remains a list containing `a`, `big` remains an empty list, `no` remains empty (but now it contains `a`), `iterable2` remains `innerLoop + 1`, `x` remains the integer value of the first input, and `a` remains the integer value of the second input.
