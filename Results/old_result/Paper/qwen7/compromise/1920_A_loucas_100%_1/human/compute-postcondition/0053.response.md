Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `no`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `no`, assigning each element to `i` in turn.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: The postcondition states that if the current value of `i` (which is an element from the list `no`) is less than or equal to the minimum value of the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value of the `big` list, then `num` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the list `no`.
   - Since the postcondition does not directly affect the values of `no`, `less`, `big`, or `num` (other than potentially decrementing `num`), these values remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be the next element in the list `no`.
   - `no` remains the same list.
   - `less` and `big` remain unchanged.
   - `num` may or may not be decremented, but since we don't know the exact value of `i` yet, we cannot determine if `num` changes without seeing the loop body. Therefore, we assume `num` remains unchanged for this adjustment.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`i` is the next element in the list `no`, `no` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with a minimum value, `big` is a list with a maximum value, and `num` remains unchanged**. 

Since the exact value of `i` is unknown without the loop body, we focus on the list `no` and the condition that it must contain at least one element.

State: **`i` is the next element in the list `no`, `no` must contain at least one element, `less` is a list with a minimum value, `big` is a list with a maximum value, and `num` remains unchanged**.
