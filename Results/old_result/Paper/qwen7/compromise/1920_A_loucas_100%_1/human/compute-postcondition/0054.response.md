Output State: **`i` is the next element in the list `no`, `no` must contain at least one element, `less` is a list with a minimum value, `big` is a list with a maximum value, `num` is `num - 1`.**

The value of `num` is decremented by 1, but the specific value of `num` is not given, so we express it as `num - 1`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `no`, `less`, `big`) remain unchanged.
