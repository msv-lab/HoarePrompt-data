Postcondition: `less`, `num`, `big`, and `no` are lists, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains `[a]` and `num` is 0. If `x` is 2, then `less` contains `[a]` and `num` is 0. Otherwise, `less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, and `no` contains `[a]`.
