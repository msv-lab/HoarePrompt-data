### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the provided problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to minimize the cost of buying `n` yogurts, where the regular price for one yogurt is `a` and the promotion price for two yogurts is `b`.
- If `b * 2 < c`, it's cheaper to buy at the regular price.
- If `b * 2 >= c`, it's cheaper to buy in pairs at the promotion price, unless the number of yogurts is odd, in which case one yogurt will be bought at the regular price.

#### Program Code Recap:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`.
- It calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the conditions provided.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price**:
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C` checks if it's cheaper to buy at the regular price.
   - The condition `elif A % 2 == 0` checks if the number of yogurts is even.
   - The condition `else` handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `A` is even, the program correctly calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - When `A` is odd, the program correctly calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

#### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is greater than `C = 9`), so it's cheaper to buy at the promotion price.
  - Since `A = 2` is even, the cost is `int(2 * 9 / 2) = 9`.
  - Output: `9` (Correct).

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is greater than `C = 9`), so it's cheaper to buy at the promotion price.
  - Since `A = 3` is odd, the cost is `int(1 * 9 / 1) + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Output: `14` (Correct).

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is less than `C = 11`), so it's cheaper to buy at the regular price.
  - Since `A = 3` is odd, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
  - Output: `15` (Correct).

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is less than `C = 11`), so it's cheaper to buy at the regular price.
  - Since `A = 4` is even, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
  - Output: `20` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts considering both the regular and promotion prices. It handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
