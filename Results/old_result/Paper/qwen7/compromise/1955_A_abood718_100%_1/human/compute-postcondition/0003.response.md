Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs t, n, a, and b where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers between 1 and 100 and 1 and 30 respectively. It does not return a specific value but processes these inputs to perform some operations or calculations.**

Note: The actual operations or calculations performed are not described here as per the given instruction.
