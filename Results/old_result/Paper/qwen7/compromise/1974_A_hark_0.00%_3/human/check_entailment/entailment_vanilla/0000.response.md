Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of the two values `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used anywhere in the program, so it is irrelevant to our analysis.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons.
   - The logic in this function seems complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using `func_2`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`

#### Input Parsing
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
```
- Correctly parses the input for `x` and `y`.

#### Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are positive
```python
if x > 0 and y > 0:
    bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
    x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
    bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
    print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
```
- `bxsfory` calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into half of the available 1x1 slots.
- `x` is adjusted by subtracting the space taken by these 2x2 icons and adding the space they save (since each 2x2 icon saves 11 1x1 slots).
- `bxsfory1` calculates the number of remaining 1x1 slots that need to be placed on additional screens.
- The result is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

#### Case 2: Only `x` is positive
```python
elif x == 0 and y > 0:
    print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```
- Simply prints the number of 2x2 icons needed, which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

#### Case 3: Only `y` is positive
```python
elif x > 0 and y == 0:
    print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```
- Simply prints the number of 1x1 icons needed, which is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

#### Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are zero
```python
else:
    print(0)
```
- Prints `0` if both `x` and `y` are zero.

### Edge Cases and Correctness

1. **Handling `x` and `y` together**:
   - The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` might not always be correct. For example, if `y` is large enough to fill up the remaining 1x1 slots after placing some 2x2 icons, the calculation might be off.

2. **General Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens seems overly complex and might not cover all edge cases properly. For instance, it does not account for the possibility of partially filling a screen with 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
