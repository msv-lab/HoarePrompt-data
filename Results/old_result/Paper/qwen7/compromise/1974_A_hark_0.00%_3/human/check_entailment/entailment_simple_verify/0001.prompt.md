You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of the two values `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used anywhere in the program, so it is irrelevant to our analysis.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons.
   - The logic in this function seems complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using `func_2`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`

#### Input Parsing
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
```
- Correctly parses the input for `x` and `y`.

#### Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are positive
```python
if x > 0 and y > 0:
    bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
    x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
    bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
    print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
```
- `bxsfory` calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into half of the available 1x1 slots.
- `x` is adjusted by subtracting the space taken by these 2x2 icons and adding the space they save (since each 2x2 icon saves 11 1x1 slots).
- `bxsfory1` calculates the number of remaining 1x1 slots that need to be placed on additional screens.
- The result is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

#### Case 2: Only `x` is positive
```python
elif x == 0 and y > 0:
    print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```
- Simply prints the number of 2x2 icons needed, which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

#### Case 3: Only `y` is positive
```python
elif x > 0 and y == 0:
    print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```
- Simply prints the number of 1x1 icons needed, which is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

#### Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are zero
```python
else:
    print(0)
```
- Prints `0` if both `x` and `y` are zero.

### Edge Cases and Correctness

1. **Handling `x` and `y` together**:
   - The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` might not always be correct. For example, if `y` is large enough to fill up the remaining 1x1 slots after placing some 2x2 icons, the calculation might be off.

2. **General Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens seems overly complex and might not cover all edge cases properly. For instance, it does not account for the possibility of partially filling a screen with 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
