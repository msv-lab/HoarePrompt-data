Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function simply returns the smaller of two integers, `a` and `b`. This is a straightforward operation and does not affect the overall correctness of the program since it's used in `func_2`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function processes the input values `x` and `y` (number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively) and calculates the minimum number of screens required. Here are the key points:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit in half the available space (`math.ceil(y / 2)`), adjusts `x` accordingly, and then calculates the remaining space needed for 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`). The total number of screens is the sum of these two values.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it directly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15)`).
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_2()`. It correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

Given the problem statement and the logic implemented in the functions, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons. The logic in `func_2` ensures that the calculations are accurate for different combinations of `x` and `y`.

Correctness: **True**
