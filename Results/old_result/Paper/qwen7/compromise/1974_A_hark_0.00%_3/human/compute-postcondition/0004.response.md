Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The function returns different outputs based on the values of x and y for each test case.**

However, since the function signature does not explicitly include parameters `t`, `x`, and `y`, and the problem statement does not provide a clear return type or condition based on these parameters within the function definition, the description focuses on the constraints provided.
