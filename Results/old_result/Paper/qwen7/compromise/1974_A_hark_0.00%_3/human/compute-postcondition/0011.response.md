Given the initial state where `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and `y` is an input integer less than or equal to 0, we need to determine the value of `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

- `x` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `y` is irrelevant to the calculation of `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

The expression `x / 15` will result in a floating-point number. Since `x` is a positive integer, dividing it by 15 will yield a positive floating-point number unless `x` is less than or equal to 15, in which case the quotient could be less than or equal to 1.

- If `x` is between 1 and 15 (inclusive), the result of `x / 15` will be a number between 0.0667 and 1 (inclusive).
- If `x` is greater than 15, the result of `x / 15` will be greater than 1.

In both cases, `math.ceil(x / 15)` will round up to the nearest integer. Therefore:

- If `x` is between 1 and 15, `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be 1.
- If `x` is greater than 15, `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only provide the general form of the output.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a positive integer greater than 0)**
