Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Transition Videos**:
   - The logic for assigning 'F' (funny) or 'S' (scary) to undecided transition videos ('?') is flawed. The current implementation tries to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios. However, the code does not consider the constraint that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type should appear for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Assigning Values**:
   - The code attempts to assign values based on the count of 'F' and 'S' transitions but does not properly handle the constraints. Specifically, it does not ensure that the solution will work for all permutations of scenarios.

3. **Incomplete Handling of Undecided Videos**:
   - The code only partially handles the assignment of undecided videos ('?'). It tries to assign 'F' or 'S' based on the count of 'F' and 'S' but does not fully address the requirement of ensuring no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type for any permutation.

4. **Missing Consideration of All Permutations**:
   - The code does not account for all possible permutations of scenarios and ensure that the condition holds for every permutation. This is a critical aspect of the problem, and the current implementation fails to meet this requirement.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm that considers all possible permutations of scenarios and ensures the constraint is met. One possible approach could involve using dynamic programming or backtracking to explore all valid assignments of 'F' and 'S' to undecided videos while ensuring the constraint is satisfied.

Here is a high-level outline of a correct approach:
1. Use a recursive function to try all possible assignments of 'F' and 'S' to undecided videos.
2. For each assignment, check if the resulting sequence meets the constraint for all permutations of scenarios.
3. If an assignment meets the constraint, return it as the solution.

Given the complexity, implementing a correct solution would require a more detailed and careful approach than the provided code.
