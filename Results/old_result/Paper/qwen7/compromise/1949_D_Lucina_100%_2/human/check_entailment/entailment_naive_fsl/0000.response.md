Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid transition video plan for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. 

Consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
.F???
.?F?.
.??.F
???F.
?????
```

The program's output for this input is:
```
.FFFF
.FFFF
.FFFF
.FFFF
.FFFF
```

However, this output is incorrect because for the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the sequence of transition videos would be `FFFFF`, which has 5 consecutive 'F' (funny) videos, violating the condition of having no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) consecutive videos of the same type.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for any permutation of the scenarios, the sequence of transition videos does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm that considers all possible permutations and ensures the constraint is met.
