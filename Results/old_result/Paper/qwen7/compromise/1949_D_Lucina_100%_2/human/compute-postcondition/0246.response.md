Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `xx` is a 2D list.
   - `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`.
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j + 1` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'S' otherwise.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the last value it took before the loop ended.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since the loop is about to start another iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Construct the new state**:
   - `xx` remains the same.
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `nx` remains the same.
   - `j` is updated to `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `j` is `j + 1`, and `n` is the same**.
