Output State: **`nx` is either 'FSFS' or 'SFSF', `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 4**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` assumes that `xx` is a list of lists (a 2D array). Given that `i` is 4 and `j` is 4, `xx[i][j-1]` would refer to `xx[4][3]`. However, since the initial state does not provide the value of `xx[4][3]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `nx`. But we know that `nx` is initially either 'FS' or 'SF', and it is being appended with the value of `xx[4][3]`, which could be 'F' or 'S'. Therefore, `nx` could become 'FSFS' or 'SFSF'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
