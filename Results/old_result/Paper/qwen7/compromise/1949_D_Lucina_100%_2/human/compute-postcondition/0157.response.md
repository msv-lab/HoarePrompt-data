Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start with `j` taking the value 1 (since `range(1, n + 1)` generates numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive).
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is 4.
   - `nx` is an empty string.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `j` will start at 1, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, which is 4. Therefore, `j` should be less than or equal to 4 at the start of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`. Specifically, `j` should be 1, and `n` should be 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1, `n` is 4**
