Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is either 'FFx', 'FSx', 'SFx', or 'SSx', `j` is 4, `n` is 4.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `total` remains 0, `i` remains 1, and `nx` is one of the strings 'FFx', 'FSx', 'SFx', or 'SSx'. The value of `j` remains 4, and `n` remains 4. The specific form of `nx` depends on whether the condition `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'` is true or false, leading to different outcomes as described in the if and else parts.
