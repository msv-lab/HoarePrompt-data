Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an input consisting of n lines, each containing n characters representing the partial transition video plan between scenarios. Each character can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video). The function ensures that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided and returns a result based on this input.**
