Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` will be set to `n` after the loop completes.
   - `j` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes.
   - Both `a` and `b` will be lists of length `n + 1`.
   - The list `xx` will contain one element which is the list `x`.
   - For each index `k` from 2 to `n + 1`, if the character `x[k - 2]` is 'F', then `a[k]` will be the count of 'F's before index `k - 1` in `x`; if the character `x[k - 2]` is 'S', then `b[k]` will be the count of 'S's before index `k - 1` in `x`.
   - The variable `xx` is appended with the list `x`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is set to `n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will start from `n + 1`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - `i` will be set to `n + 1` for the next iteration.

6. **Other States:**
   - `j`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged.**
