Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `a[2]` is yet to be determined
   - `b[2]` is 0
   - `sa` is a list containing the values 1 and 2
   - `sb` is a list containing the values 1 and 2

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain at least 3.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 3
   - `a[2]` remains yet to be determined
   - `b[2]` remains 0
   - `sa` remains a list containing the values 1 and 2
   - `sb` remains a list containing the values 1 and 2

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `a[2]` is yet to be determined, `b[2]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the values 1 and 2, `sb` is a list containing the values 1 and 2**
