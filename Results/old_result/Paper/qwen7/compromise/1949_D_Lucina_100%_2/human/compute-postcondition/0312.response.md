Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is `xx[4][2]`, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `i` is 4 and `j` is 3, `j - 1` equals 2. Therefore, `nx` is updated to include `xx[4][2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
