Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is at least 4
   - `x` is an input string
   - `j` is 5
   - `xx` is a list containing the string `x`
   - Either `a[5]` is increased by 1 if `x[4]` is 'F', or `b[5]` is increased by 1 if `x[4]` is 'S', or no changes are made to the variables if `x[4]` is neither 'F' nor 'S'.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 4.
   - Therefore, `i` (which is currently 1) needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `n` remains at least 4.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be adjusted to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is already at least 4.

5. **Note that other variables (`x`, `j`, `xx`, `a`, `b`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.**

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4**
