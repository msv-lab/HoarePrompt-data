Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `a[i]` is 0.
   - `b[i]` is 0.
   - `sb` has appended the value `i`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because `n` is the total number of iterations and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a[2]` will be 0 (since `a[i]` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration and `i` is now 2).
   - `b[2]` will be 0 (since `b[i]` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration and `i` is now 2).
   - `sb` will have appended the value `2` (since `sb` appended `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `i` is now 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a[2]` is 0, `b[2]` is 0, and `sb` has appended the value 2.**
