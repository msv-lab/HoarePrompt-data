Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 4, and `nx` is 'FSSF'.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 4, `n` remains 3, and `j` reaches 4. The string `nx` is constructed based on the conditions within the loop. Given that the loop iterates three times (from `j = 1` to `j = 3`), and considering the possible outcomes described in the previous iterations, the final value of `nx` is 'FSSF'. This result assumes that the conditions inside the loop (whether `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or if `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`) lead to the sequence 'FSSF' being appended to `nx`.
