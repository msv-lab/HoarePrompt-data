Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `x` is an input string
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is a list of characters, and `j` is an index within the list `x`. If the character at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'F', then the value of `a[j]` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', then the value of `b[j]` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j-1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the code raises a TypeError because `b[j]` is a string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 1, and `n` is such that previous_j + 1 <= n. The character at `x[previous_j]` must be either 'F' or 'S'. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes occur to `a[j]` and `b[j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 2, and `n` is such that previous_j + 2 <= n. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes occur to `a[j]` and `b[j]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
