Output State: **`nx` is 'x', `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 4, `j` is 1 (since `j - 1` is 0), and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the value of `xx[4][0]` is taken and appended to `nx`. Assuming `xx[4][0]` is 'x', `nx` becomes 'x'. All other variables remain unchanged.
