Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` is 3
   - `nx` is ''
   - `j` is 3
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The loop will start with `j` being 1 (since the range starts from 1).
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given `n` is 3, `n + 1` is 4.
   - Therefore, `j` must be less than 4.

5. **Current Value of `j`**: Currently, `j` is 3, which satisfies the condition `j < 4`.

6. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`i`, `nx`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`) do not affect the loop's execution based on the given conditions.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is '', `j` is 3**
