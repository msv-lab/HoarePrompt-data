Output State: **`xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `i` is an index within the bounds of `xx`, and `j - 1` is an index within the bounds of `xx[i]`; `nx` is 'F'; either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]'**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. The values of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, `j - 1`, and the condition about `sa` remain unchanged.
