Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 4, `nx` is 'FSF'**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with the string `'F'`. Since the initial value of `nx` is either `'FS'` or `'SF'`, after executing `nx += 'F'`, the value of `nx` becomes either `'FSF'` or `'SFF'`. However, since the exact initial value of `nx` is not specified, we can represent it as `'FSF'` as both initial values lead to this format. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
