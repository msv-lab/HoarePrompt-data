Output State: **`x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 2, `n` is such that previous_j + 2 <= n, `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. The values of `x`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
