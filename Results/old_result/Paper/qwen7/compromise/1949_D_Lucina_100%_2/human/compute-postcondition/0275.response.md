Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 1 (since `range(1, n + 1)` means `j` starts from 1).
   - `n` is given as 3.

3. **Check if the loop condition is satisfied**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.
   - Initially, `j` is 1 and `n` is 3, so `j < n + 1` is true (`1 < 4`).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 1, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` remains 3 for the loop to execute correctly.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `i` is mentioned but is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `nx` is an empty string and is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted either.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must remain 3.
- `j` should start at 1.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is less than 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1**
