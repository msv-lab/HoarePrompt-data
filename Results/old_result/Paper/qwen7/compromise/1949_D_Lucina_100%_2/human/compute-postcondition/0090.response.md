Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

2. **Understand the Initial States**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is either `1` or `2` (at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `a` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[j]` increased by 1 if `j` is `2`.
   - `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()`.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is `'F'`, then `a[j]` is `2`. Otherwise, `j` is set to `2` and `b[j]` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n + 1`, the next value of `j` would be `2` if `j` was `1` in the previous iteration, and it would be `n + 1` if `j` was `2` in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` remains `n + 1` because the loop does not change `i`.
   - `j` will be the next value in the range, which is `2` if `j` was `1` and `n + 1` if `j` was `2`.
   - `a` and `b` will be adjusted based on the new value of `j`.
   - `xx` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

Given the conditions, if `j` was `1` in the previous iteration, then `j` will be `2` in the next iteration. If `j` was `2` in the previous iteration, then `j` will be `n + 1` in the next iteration.

Since the problem does not specify which value `j` had at the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider both possibilities:

- If `j` was `1`, then `j` will be `2`.
- If `j` was `2`, then `j` will be `n + 1`.

However, since the loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`, we can conclude that `j` will be `2` in the next iteration if it was `1` in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[2]` increased by 1, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()`**.
