Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `a[2]` is yet to be determined, `b[2]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3, `sb` is a list containing the values 1 and 2. If `a[3]` is greater than 0 and `b[3]` equals 0, then `sa` remains unchanged and `sb` remains unchanged. If `a[3]` is not greater than 0 or `b[3]` does not equal 0, then `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.
