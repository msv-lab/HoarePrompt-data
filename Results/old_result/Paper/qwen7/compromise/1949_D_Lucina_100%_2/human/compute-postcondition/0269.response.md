Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 2, `a[2]` is 0, `b[2]` is 0, `sb` has [2, 2, 3]**.

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` contains `[2, 2]`. After appending 3, `sb` becomes `[2, 2, 3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a[2]`, and `b[2]` remain unchanged.
