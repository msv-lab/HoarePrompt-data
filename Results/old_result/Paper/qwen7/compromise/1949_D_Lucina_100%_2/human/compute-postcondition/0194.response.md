Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `j` must be within the range [1, 5), `n` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 5, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', so `nx` is updated to include the value of `xx[5][j - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
