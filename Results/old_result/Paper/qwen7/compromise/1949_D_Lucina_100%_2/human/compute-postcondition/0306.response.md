Output State: **`i` is less than 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is either 'SFSFSF' or 'FFSFSF', or `nx` is one of 'SFSFSS', 'FFSFSF', 'SFFS', 'FFFS', 'SFFSS', 'FFFSS', 'SFFF', or 'FFFF', `j` is 3, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (which in this case is 3 iterations since `n` is 3), `i` will still be less than 4 because the loop does not change `i`. The variable `n` remains 3. The string `nx` will be built up over the three iterations, with each iteration adding either 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions inside the loop. Since `j` ranges from 1 to 3, it will always be 3 at the end of the loop. The value of `xx[i][j - 1]` will not be '?' after the loop, as per the given conditions and the fact that the loop only appends non-'?' characters to `nx`.
