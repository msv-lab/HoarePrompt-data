Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - According to the given state, `i` is initially `n + 1`.
   - `n` is the total number of iterations the loop will execute.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means `i` will take values from 1 up to `n + 1` inclusive.

4. **Initial Value of `i`**: Since `i` is initially `n + 1`, the loop will start with `i = n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must decrease to 1. However, since `i` starts at `n + 1`, the loop will not execute at all because the condition `1 <= i < n + 1` will never be satisfied.

5. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to be within the range `[1, n + 1)`. Specifically, `i` should be set to 1.

6. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`a[i]`, `b[i]`, `sa`, `sb`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 1 and `n` remains as it is (since `n` is the total number of iterations).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed**
