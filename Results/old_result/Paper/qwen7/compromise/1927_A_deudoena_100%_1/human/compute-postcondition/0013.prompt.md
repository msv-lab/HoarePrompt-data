You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `c` is the length of `s`, `d` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `l` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop increments `c` for each character in the string `s`. If the character 'B' is encountered, `mi` is set to the current value of `c` and the loop breaks. Since no specific values for `s` are given, `c` will be the length of `s` after the loop completes, assuming 'B' was not found or the loop did not break. The variables `ma`, `d`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ma` is the distance from the end of the string `s` where the character 'B' is found, `mi` is 0, `c` is the length of `s`, `d` is the number of characters processed before finding 'B', `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the distance from the end of the string `s` where the character 'B' is found, which is `ma`, minus 0 (the value of `mi`), plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a string `s` of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. It finds the last occurrence of 'B' in the string and calculates the distance from the end of the string to this occurrence, then returns this distance plus 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the distance from the end of the string `s` where the character 'B' is found, which is `ma`, minus 0 (the value of `mi`), plus 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
