You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: All test cases have been processed, and `ans` contains the result for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the length of the array minus the maximum of two segments defined by consecutive equal elements at the beginning and end of the array. If the first and last elements of the array are equal, it adjusts the calculation accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `le` is initialized to the length of the array.
   - `l` and `r` are set to the start and end indices of the array.
   - `st` and `end` are set to 1, indicating the initial segments where the array elements are the same at the beginning and end.

3. **Left Segment Calculation**:
   - A loop runs while `l < r` and the element at `l` is equal to the element at `l + 1`.
   - This loop increments `l` and adds 1 to `st`, effectively counting the length of the segment from the start where all elements are the same.

4. **Right Segment Calculation**:
   - A similar loop runs while `r > l` and the element at `r` is equal to the element at `r - 1`.
   - This loop decrements `r` and adds 1 to `end`, effectively counting the length of the segment from the end where all elements are the same.

5. **Initial Answer Calculation**:
   - `ans` is calculated as `le - max(st, end)`. This represents the minimum cost to make the entire array uniform if the uniform value is either the first or last segment.

6. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the first and last elements are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the answer is adjusted to `max(0, le - (st + end))`. This ensures that overlapping segments are correctly handled.

7. **Output**:
   - The final answer is printed for each test case.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - The program correctly identifies that the minimum cost is achieved by setting the middle segment to `1`, resulting in `4` burles.

2. **Example 2**: 
   - Input: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly identifies that no operation is needed since all elements are already the same.

3. **Example 3**: 
   - Input: `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program correctly identifies that the minimum cost is achieved by setting the middle segment to `8`, resulting in `2` burles.

4. **Example 4**: 
   - Input: `[1]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly identifies that no operation is needed since the array has only one element.

5. **Example 5**: 
   - Input: `[1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly identifies that the minimum cost is achieved by setting the entire array to `1`, resulting in `1` burle.

6. **Example 6**: 
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly identifies that the minimum cost is achieved by setting the entire array to `1`, resulting in `1` burle.

7. **Example 7**: 
   - Input: `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - The program correctly identifies that the minimum cost is achieved by setting the middle segment to `1`, resulting in `6` burles.

8. **Example 8**: 
   - Input: `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `7`
   - The program correctly identifies that the minimum cost is achieved by setting the middle segment to `5`, resulting in `7` burles.
