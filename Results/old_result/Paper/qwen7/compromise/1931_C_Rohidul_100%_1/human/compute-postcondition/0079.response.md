To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states step by step.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
```

For the loop to continue executing, both conditions must be true:
1. `l < r`
2. `a[l] == a[l + 1]`

### Given States
- `le` is the length of the new list `a`
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`
- `l` is increased by 1 (let's denote the new value of `l` as `l_new`)
- `st` is 2

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition 1: `l < r`**
   - The current value of `l` is `l_new`.
   - For the loop to continue, `l_new` must be less than `r`.

2. **Condition 2: `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**
   - The current value of `l` is `l_new`.
   - For the loop to continue, `a[l_new]` must be equal to `a[l_new + 1]`.

### Adjusting the States
- The only variables directly involved in the loop condition are `l` and `a[l]`.
- We need to ensure that `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` hold true for the next iteration.

Given that `l` is increased by 1 in the loop body, let's denote the new value of `l` as `l_new = l + 1`.

#### Adjusted States
- To ensure `l < r` holds true, `l_new` (which is `l + 1`) must be less than `r`.
- To ensure `a[l] == a[l + 1]` holds true, `a[l_new]` (which is `a[l + 1]`) must be equal to `a[l_new + 1]` (which is `a[l + 2]`).

### Final Answer
State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `l` must be less than `r - 1`, `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`, `st` is 2**
