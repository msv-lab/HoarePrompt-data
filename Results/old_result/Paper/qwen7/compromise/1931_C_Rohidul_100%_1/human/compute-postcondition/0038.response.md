Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `r` is one less than `l` (meaning `r = l - 1`), `end` is equal to `l + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `le = len(a)` calculates the length of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `le`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
