Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1**.

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
