Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-2`, `st` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1 and is now `l+1`, and `end` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1. Initially, `r` was equal to `l + 1`. After decrementing `r`, `r` becomes `l`, which is `r - 1`. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
