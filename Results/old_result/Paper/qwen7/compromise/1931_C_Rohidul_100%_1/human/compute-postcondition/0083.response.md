Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `l` is increased by 1 and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`, `st` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` is increased by 1, while `le`, `n`, `a[0] == a[1]`, `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, and `st` retain their original conditions and values.
