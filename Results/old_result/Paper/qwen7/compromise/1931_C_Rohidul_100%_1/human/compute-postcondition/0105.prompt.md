Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    le = len(a)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 1, 1
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    ans = le - max(st, end)
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `r` is one less than `l`, meaning `r = l - 1`; `end` is equal to `l + 1`; `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, the current value of `r` is `n - k - 1`, `end` is `2k + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop, and `ans` is updated to max(0, le - ((n - k - 1) + (2k + 1))) if the first and last elements of list `a` are equal. If the first and last elements are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`, `r` is equal to `l+1`, `end` is `le-1`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. If `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`, then `ans` is set to `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as above regardless of the if condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
