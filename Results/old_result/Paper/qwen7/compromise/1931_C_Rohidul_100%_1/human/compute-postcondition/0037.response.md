Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `r` is one less than `l` (meaning `r = l - 1`), `end` is equal to `l + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. The initial values of `n`, `r`, `l`, `end`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
