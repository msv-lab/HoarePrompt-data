Output State: **`l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 2, `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`, `st` is 1**

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Given that `st` was initially not specified in the initial state, it is reasonable to assume it started as 0 (since no other value was given). After executing `st += 1`, `st` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
