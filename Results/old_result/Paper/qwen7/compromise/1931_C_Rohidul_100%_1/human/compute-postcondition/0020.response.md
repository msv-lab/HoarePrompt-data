Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `r` is decreased by 1.
   - `end` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on `r` and `a[r]`.
   - Since `r` is already decreased by 1, we know that `r` is now one less than its previous value.
   - We need to check if `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` (which is the value of `a[r + 1]` from the previous iteration).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the new value of `r` still satisfies the condition `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
   - Since `r` is decreased by 1, we need to ensure that `r` is still greater than `l` and that `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `r` must be greater than `l` and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

### Final Answer

State: **`r` must be greater than `l` and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**
