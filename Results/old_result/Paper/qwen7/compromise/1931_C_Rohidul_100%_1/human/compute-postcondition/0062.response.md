Output State: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is now `n - k - 1`, where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed, `end` is `2k + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop, and `end` is incremented by 1 with each iteration.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `l` will be equal to `r` + 1 because the loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Each time the loop runs, `r` is decremented by 1, and `end` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after `k` iterations, `r` will be `n - k - 1`. The value of `end` will be `2k + 1` since it starts at 2 and increments by 1 with each iteration. The value of `st` remains the last incremented value inside the loop, but its exact value depends on the specific sequence of operations within the loop during each iteration.
