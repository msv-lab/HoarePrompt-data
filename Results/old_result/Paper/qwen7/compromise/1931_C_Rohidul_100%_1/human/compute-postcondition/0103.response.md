Postcondition: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`, `r` is equal to `l+1`, `end` is `le-1`, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. If `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`, then `ans` is set to `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as above regardless of the if condition.**
