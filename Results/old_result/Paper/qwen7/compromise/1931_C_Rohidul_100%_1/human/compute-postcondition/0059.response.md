Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` must be equal.**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since `l` is equal to `r` + 1, the relationship between `l` and `r` remains intact, just with `r` being one less than `l`. The condition that `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` must be equal is still required, but no specific values are given for these elements, so the condition remains as stated.
