Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is 1, `r` is n - 1, `end` is 2, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input such that `a[0] == a[1]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 1, `end` is 2**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` is 0, so after executing this line, `l` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
