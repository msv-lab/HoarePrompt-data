Output State: **`r` is now `r - 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`; `end` is increased by 1.**

The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. The initial conditions that `r` is now `r - 1` and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, these conditions are still valid after the code execution.
