Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-2`, `st` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1 and is now `l+1`, and `end` is increased by 1 to `end+1`.**

The code `end += 1` increases the value of `end` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
