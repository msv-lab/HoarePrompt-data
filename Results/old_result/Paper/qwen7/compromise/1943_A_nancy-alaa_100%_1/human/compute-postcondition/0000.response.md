Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python when you don't need the index or value), and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. This means the state before the loop starts must include the condition that the input provided by `int(input())` is valid for the loop to execute.

3. **Analyze the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input is a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4). Therefore, the state before the loop starts must ensure that the input will be within this range.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input will be a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4.

Since the loop will read from `input()` and convert it to an integer, the state before the loop starts must ensure that the input will be a valid integer within the specified range.

**Final State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4**
