Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `first` is `True`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
   - `i` is less than `n + 1`.
   - If `mpp[i] == 1`, `first` becomes `True`. (This condition was already satisfied in the previous iteration, as `first` is still `True`.)
   - If `mpp[i] != 1`, the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is not met.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range `range(n + 1)`.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`, the only variable that needs adjustment is `i`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

5. **New State:**
   - `first` remains `True` because the condition `mpp[i] == 1` was met in the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `arr` remains the same.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`first` is True, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is less than `n + 1` and equal to the previous value of `i` + 1**. 

To express this precisely:

State: **`first` is True, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is less than `n + 1` and equal to the previous value of `i` + 1**.
