Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
- `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
- The current value of `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

The print statement `print(i)` will simply print the value of `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of its constraints. However, since `i` is explicitly mentioned to be less than `n + 1` and is not a key in `mpp`, we can directly use `i` in our output.

Output: **i (where i is an integer less than n + 1 and is not a key in mpp)**
