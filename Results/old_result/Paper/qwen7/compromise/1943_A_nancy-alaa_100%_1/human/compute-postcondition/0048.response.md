Output State: **`first` is True, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a Counter object `mpp` that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. This does not change the values of the other variables (`first`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`). Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state.
