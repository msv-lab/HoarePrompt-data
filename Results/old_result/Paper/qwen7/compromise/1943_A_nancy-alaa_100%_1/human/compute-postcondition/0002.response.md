Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function then converts each string in the list to an integer. The original value of `n` remains unchanged, and `arr` now holds the list of integers entered by the user.
