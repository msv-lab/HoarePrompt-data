Postcondition: `first` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and if the current value of `i` is such that `mpp[i]` equals 1, then the program continues executing the next statements. If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
