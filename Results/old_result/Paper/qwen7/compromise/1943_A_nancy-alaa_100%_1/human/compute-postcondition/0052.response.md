Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is `0`.
- The current value of `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is explicitly stated to be `0`.

Output: **0**
