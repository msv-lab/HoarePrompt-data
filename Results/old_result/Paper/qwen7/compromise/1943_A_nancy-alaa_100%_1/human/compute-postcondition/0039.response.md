Postcondition: `first` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
