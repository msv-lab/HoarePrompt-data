Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

To determine the value of `i`, we need to consider the last known value of `i` before the condition `if i not in mpp:` was checked. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact number it will be when the print statement executes. However, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration and the loop or if statement breaks when `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

Given this information, the output will be the value of `i` at the point just before the `print(i)` statement, which is 1 more than the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Output: **i (where i is the value of i at the point just before the print statement, which is 1 more than the value of i at the end of the previous iteration)**
