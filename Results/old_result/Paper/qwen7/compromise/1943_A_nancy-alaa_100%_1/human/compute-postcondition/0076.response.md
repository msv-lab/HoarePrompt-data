Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the range `range(n + 1)`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `first` remains False
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `arr` is a list of integers converted from input
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop.
   - The values of `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged unless they are modified inside the loop, but since no such modification is mentioned, they stay the same.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `first` remains False
   - `n` remains the same
   - `arr` remains the same
   - `i` will be `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (which is not specified but can be represented as `i + 1`).

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`**
