Output State: **`first` is True, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and if `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.**

Explanation: The variable `first` is explicitly set to `True`. All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `mpp`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition described in the postcondition about breaking out of a loop or if statement when `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True remains the same.
