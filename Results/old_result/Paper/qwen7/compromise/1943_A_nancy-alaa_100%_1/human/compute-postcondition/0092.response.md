Output State: **`first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `n` is updated to the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` updates the `mpp` variable to be a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input by the user, and the other variables retain their previous states.
