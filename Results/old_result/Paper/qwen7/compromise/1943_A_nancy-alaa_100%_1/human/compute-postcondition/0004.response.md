Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**

Explanation: The variable `first` is set to `False`, which does not affect the values of `n`, `arr`, or `mpp`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
