Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes integers n, x, and y (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns the result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes specific parameters and a list of integers. The function does not take any parameters itself but works with the provided input data to produce the required output for each test case.
