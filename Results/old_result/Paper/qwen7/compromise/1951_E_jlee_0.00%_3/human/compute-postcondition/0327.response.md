Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The values of the variables `j`, `n`, `s[j]`, `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done`, and `count` remain unchanged.
