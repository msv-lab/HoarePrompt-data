Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and `count` is greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `s[j]`, `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done`, and `count`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in.
