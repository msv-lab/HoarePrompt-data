Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is 3, `count2` is 0, `i` is 4, `string` is an input string.**

The code `string = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `string`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
