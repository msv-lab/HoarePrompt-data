Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` is at least 7, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is 4, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `j` is 4, `n` is at least 7, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is 4, and `done` is set to True. None of these variables are modified by the `break` statement, so their values remain unchanged.
