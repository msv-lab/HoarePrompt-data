Output State: **`done` is True, `count` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `done` and `count`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is inside. Since no such loop or if statement is mentioned as being entered again, the values remain unchanged.
