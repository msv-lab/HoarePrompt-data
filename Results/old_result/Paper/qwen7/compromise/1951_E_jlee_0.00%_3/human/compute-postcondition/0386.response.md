Output: **YES**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, the variables and conditions are as follows:
- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be at least 7, but its exact value is not specified.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`.

The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES'. Since no other variables or values need to be computed or described, the output remains as the string 'YES'.
