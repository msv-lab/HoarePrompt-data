The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` which is currently 1, `done` is False.**
