Output: **string[:2], string[2:] (where `string[:2]` is the substring of `string` from index 0 to 1, and `string[2:]` is the substring of `string` starting from index 2)**

Explanation:
- `j` is given as 2.
- `string[:j]` means the substring of `string` from index 0 to `j-1`, which is `string[:2]`.
- `string[j:]` means the substring of `string` starting from index `j`, which is `string[2:]`.

Given that `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, it implies that the characters at positions `j` and `n - 1 - j` in the string are different, but this does not affect the slicing operation performed in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be the two substrings as described.
