Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 3.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- `done` is True.
- `count` is 3.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 3.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `j` is 3.
- Therefore, `string[:j]` will be the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the 4th character (index 3).
- `string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from the 4th character (index 3) to the end.

However, the exact content of `string` is not provided. Since we don't have the actual string, we can only describe it in terms of the indices.

Output: **string[:3], string[3:]**
