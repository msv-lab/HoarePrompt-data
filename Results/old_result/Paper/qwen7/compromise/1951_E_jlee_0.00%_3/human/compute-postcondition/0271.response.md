Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`
   - `done` is True
   - `count` is greater than or equal to 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
   ```
   This means the loop will iterate over values of `j` from 0 up to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.

3. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - The loop will increment `j` by 1, so the next value of `j` will be 2.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - We need to update the state of `j` to 2.
   - Since the loop condition does not depend on `n`, `s[j]`, `done`, or `count`, these states remain unchanged unless explicitly mentioned in the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and `count` is greater than or equal to 0**
