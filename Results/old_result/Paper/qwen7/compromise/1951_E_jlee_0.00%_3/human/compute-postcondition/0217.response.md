Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
