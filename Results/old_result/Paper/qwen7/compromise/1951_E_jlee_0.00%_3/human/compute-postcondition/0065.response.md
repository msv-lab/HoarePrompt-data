Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `n` is 2
- `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`
- `done` is set to True
- `count` is greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` does not equal `x`
- `count2` is a value greater than 0 but less than `count`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given `j` is 0, the slicing operation `string[:j]` will result in an empty string because it starts from the beginning up to (but not including) the index `j`, which is 0. 

The slicing operation `string[j:]` will return the entire string since it starts from index `j` (which is 0) and goes to the end of the string.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Output: **'', string**
