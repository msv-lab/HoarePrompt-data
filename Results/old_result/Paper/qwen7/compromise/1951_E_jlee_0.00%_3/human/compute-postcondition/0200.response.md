Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, `i` is 2, `t` is 2.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
