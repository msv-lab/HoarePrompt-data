Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` which is currently 2, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the list `s`. If the count of `x` in the list `s` is equal to 2, we continue the loop or statement we were inside. Otherwise, `s.count(x)` is equal to 1, or `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is not equal to `x`.
