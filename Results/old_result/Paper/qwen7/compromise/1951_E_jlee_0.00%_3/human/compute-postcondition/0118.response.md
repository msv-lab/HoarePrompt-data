Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is 2.
   - `done` is set to `True`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The expression `string[:j - 1]` means we need to slice the string from the start up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
     - Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:0]`, which is an empty string (`""`).
   - The expression `string[j - 1:]` means we need to slice the string starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.
     - Again, since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. Therefore, `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[0:]`, which is the entire string `string`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print two parts: an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Given the initial state, the exact value of `string` is not provided. Therefore, the output will be an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Output: **"" string (where string is the value of the string variable)**
