Postcondition: **j is 4, n is greater than 7, s[j] is not equal to x, count is 4, done is True, count2 is 0.** 

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the if condition `not done` is not met (since `done` is initially `True`), and there is no else part to change the variables' states.
