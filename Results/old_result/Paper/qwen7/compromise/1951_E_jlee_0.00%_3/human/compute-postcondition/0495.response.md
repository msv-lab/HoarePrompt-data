Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` is greater than 7, `count` is 4, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `count`, or `done`. It only causes the loop or conditional block it is within to terminate. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and the only additional information is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
