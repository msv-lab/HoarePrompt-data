Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4**.

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, which is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^4. All other variables (`a`, `b`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state, meaning they are still integers within the range of 1 to 10^18.
