Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, a, b, and m, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and a, b, and m are integers between 1 and 10^18. For each test case defined by t, the function performs operations using a, b, and m and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function indirectly accepts four parameters (t, a, b, m) through its processing logic, where t defines the number of test cases, and a, b, and m are used within each test case. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
