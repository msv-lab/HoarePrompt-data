### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges over consecutive rows in a river grid.
   - Each row can have supports installed with a cost calculated using `func_1`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the cost of installing supports in a single row.
   - It initializes the first support cost to `row[0] + 1`.
   - For subsequent cells, it finds the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells and adds `1` to it.
   - This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It constructs the grid `rows` from the input.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row and stores these costs in `costs`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the cost for a single row.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the implementation appears to be correct and follows the requirements.
