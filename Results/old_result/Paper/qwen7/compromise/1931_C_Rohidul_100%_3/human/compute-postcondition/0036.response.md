Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n`, but does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.
