Output State: `total` is 0, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the original value of `n-1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the total number of iterations executed, `end` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` must equal `a[1]`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`. Each iteration increments `l` by 1 and increases `st` (start) by 1. This process repeats until `l` is no longer less than `r`. At this point, `l` will be equal to `r`, meaning all consecutive duplicate elements have been skipped. The value of `r` remains unchanged from its initial state, and since the loop condition is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. All other variables (`total`, `a`, `le`, `st`, `end`, `ans`) retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
