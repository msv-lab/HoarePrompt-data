Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 5`, `r` is `n - 6`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-5] == a[n-4]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `-2`, `end` is 3, `ans` is `-1**.

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` was 2, so after executing the code, `end` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
