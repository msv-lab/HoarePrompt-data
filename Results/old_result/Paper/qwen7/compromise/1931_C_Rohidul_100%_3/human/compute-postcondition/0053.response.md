Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 4`, `r` is `n - 3 - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-4] == a[n-3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `le - (n - 2)`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 2`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 3 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
