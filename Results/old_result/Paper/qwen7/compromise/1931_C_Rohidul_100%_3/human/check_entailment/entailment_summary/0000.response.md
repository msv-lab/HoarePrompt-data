Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest subarray where the first and last elements are not part of any consecutive duplicates. However, the logic in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `st` and `end`:**
   - The program increments `st` and `end` when it encounters consecutive identical elements at the start and end of the array, respectively. This approach is flawed because it only counts the number of consecutive duplicates and does not consider the actual cost of making all elements in those subarrays equal.
   
2. **Adjustment for Equal First and Last Elements:**
   - The adjustment for the case where the first and last elements are the same is also incorrect. The program subtracts the sum of `st` and `end` from the length of the array, but this does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal.

3. **Objective Mismatch:**
   - The goal is to minimize the cost of making all elements equal, which is determined by the length of the subarray that needs to be changed. The program should identify the longest subarray where all elements can be made equal with a single operation, and then calculate the cost based on the length of this subarray.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
