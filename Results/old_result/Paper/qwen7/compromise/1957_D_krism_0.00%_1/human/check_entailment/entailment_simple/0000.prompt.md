Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Specifically, if `arr` has `k` elements, the `prefix` list will be `[0, v1 ^ 0, v2 ^ (v1 ^ 0), ..., vk ^ (vk-1 ^ ... ^ (v2 ^ (v1 ^ 0))...)]`, where `v1, v2, ..., vk` are the elements of `arr`.
    #
    #This means that each element in the `prefix` list (except the first one) is the result of XORing the current element of `arr` with all previous elements' cumulative XOR results. The loop will execute exactly `len(arr)` times, appending the cumulative XOR value for each element in `arr` to the `prefix` list.

    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, the variable `i` will be 31 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration), and each list in `pre` will have its first element set to 32, as `pre[i][0]` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

    #State: Output State: `i` is 33, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[32]` (though `arr` does not exist beyond index 31, so `y` is undefined), `k` is 5, `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each bit position from 0 to 31, `c` is `prefix[33]` (though `prefix` does not extend beyond index 32, so `c` is undefined), `j` is 32, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` are both 0, reflecting that all counts have been fully decremented, and `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` represent the total counts of 0s and 1s across all 32 bits.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all 32 iterations, the variable `i` will be 33 (though it doesn't affect the final state of `suf` and `pre`), `y` and `c` will be undefined because they refer to indices out of bounds, `k` will be 5 (the bit length of `y` minus 1), `ans` will be the accumulated sum calculated during the loop, and for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will be 0, indicating no more counts left to decrement. The `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` will hold the total counts of 0s and 1s across all 32 bits processed.
