Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing `[0]`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the list `prefix` with a single element `[0]`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
