Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- There is a list of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

The print statement in question is:

```python
print('-----------------')
```

This statement simply prints a string consisting of hyphens. Since no variables or objects are involved in this print statement, it will directly output the string provided.

Output: **-----------------**
