Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `suf` is a list where each element is a tuple `[int + 1, int]`**

Explanation: The code increments the first element of the tuple in the `suf` list at index `j` by 1. The other elements remain unchanged. Since the initial value of the first element of the tuple at index `j` was an integer, after the increment, it becomes `int + 1`. The `cur` and `j` variables are not directly affected by this line of code, so they retain their initial states.
