Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 3, `pre[3][0]` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `pre[3][0]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
