Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1, and the result of `(cur >> j & 1)` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code increments the first element of the list `suf[j]` by 1. The values of `cur` and `j` remain unchanged. Additionally, the condition `(cur >> j & 1)` being `False` remains true after the execution of the code.
