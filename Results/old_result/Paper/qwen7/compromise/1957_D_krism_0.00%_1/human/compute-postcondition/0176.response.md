Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer + 1 (or 0 if `j` was 31), `pre` is the same array where the first element of the `j`-th subarray is increased by 1, `suf` is the array where the first element of the `j`-th subarray is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decreases the first element of the `j`-th subarray in the `suf` array by 1. The other variables (`c`, `j`, and `pre`) remain unchanged. The value of `j` is updated to be an integer + 1 (or 0 if `j` was 31) as per the initial state.
