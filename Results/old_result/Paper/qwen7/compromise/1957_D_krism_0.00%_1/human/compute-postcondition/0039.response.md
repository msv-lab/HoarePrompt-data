Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 32.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 31
   - `n` is 31
   - `cur` is `prefix[31]`
   - `j` is 1
   - If the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then `suf[1][1]` is 1. Otherwise, `suf[1][0]` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration of the Loop**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `j < 32`.
   - After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `cur` remains `prefix[31]` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` will be 2.
   - The condition for `suf[1][1]` or `suf[1][0]` will depend on the bit at position `j` (which is now 2) in `cur`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 2**.
