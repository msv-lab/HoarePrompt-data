Postcondition: `j` is 31, `c` is an integer where the bit at position 31 is 0 or `suf[31][1]` is decremented by 1, `pre[31][0]` is 0, and `suf[31][0]` is -1 if the bit is 0. If the bit at position 31 of `c` is 1, then `pre[31][1]` is 1 and `suf[31][1]` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `pre[31][0]` is 1 and `suf[31][0]` is 0.
