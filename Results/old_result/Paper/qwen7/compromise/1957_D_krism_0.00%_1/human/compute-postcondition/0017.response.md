Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(32)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 32`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 32.

4. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`. Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration and will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration, the new state should reflect this change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1**
