Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is -1, `n` is 31, `cur` is undefined, `j` is 32, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` is 32 and `suf[j][0]` is 32, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    y = arr[i - 1]
    k = y.bit_length() - 1
    ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
    c = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if c >> j & 1:
            pre[j][1] += 1
            suf[j][1] -= 1
        else:
            pre[j][0] += 1
            suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 2, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 32, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, either `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1 if the corresponding bit in `c` (which is `prefix[1]`) is 1, or `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1 otherwise.

This means that after the loop has executed all 32 iterations, the variable `j` will have reached 32. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, the value of `suf[j][1]` or `suf[j][0]` will have been adjusted based on whether the corresponding bit in `c` (which is `prefix[1]`) is 1 or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all 32 iterations. The variable `j` is now 32. The variable `c` remains as it was initially set, with its bits unchanged from the start. For each bit position from 0 to 31, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` will reflect the count of 0s and 1s respectively up to that bit position, and `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will reflect the count of 0s and 1s from that bit position to the end of the integer `c`. Specifically, for bit position 31, if the bit is 0, `pre[31][0]` is 0, `pre[31][1]` is 1, `suf[31][0]` is -1, and `suf[31][1]` is 0. If the bit is 1, `pre[31][0]` is 1, `pre[31][1]` is 0, `suf[31][0]` is -2, and `suf[31][1]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, `c` will still be `prefix[i]`, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` will reflect the total count of 0s and 1s across all 32 bits, and `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will both be lists of length 32 with all elements being 0 since they are decremented until reaching 0. The variable `k` will be the bit length of `y` minus 1, `y` will be equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `ans` will be the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each bit position from 0 to 31.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
