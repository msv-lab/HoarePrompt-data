You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    #This is printed: -----------------
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: The `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR values starting from 0 up to the last element of `arr`. Specifically, if `arr` has `k` elements, the `prefix` list will be `[0, v1 ^ 0, v2 ^ (v1 ^ 0), ..., vk ^ (vk-1 ^ ... ^ (v2 ^ (v1 ^ 0))...)]`, where `v1, v2, ..., vk` are the elements of `arr`.
    #
    #This means that each element in the `prefix` list (except the first one) is the result of XORing the current element of `arr` with all previous elements' cumulative XOR results. The loop will execute exactly `len(arr)` times, appending the cumulative XOR value for each element in `arr` to the `prefix` list.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: [a1, a2, a3, ..., ak], [0, a1, a1 ^ a2, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, ..., ak ^ (ak-1 ^ ... ^ a2 ^ a1)]
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 31; `pre[i][0]` is 32.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, the variable `i` will be 31 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration), and each list in `pre` will have its first element set to 32, as `pre[i][0]` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: `i` is -1, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[-1]` (which is out of index), `j` is 32, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` is 32 and `suf[j][0]` is 32.
    print(pre)
    #This is printed: pre (where pre is undefined)
    print(suf)
    #This is printed: [[32, 32], [32, 32], ..., [32, 32]] (a 32x2 matrix with each element being 32)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 33, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[32]` (though `arr` does not exist beyond index 31, so `y` is undefined), `k` is 5, `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each bit position from 0 to 31, `c` is `prefix[33]` (though `prefix` does not extend beyond index 32, so `c` is undefined), `j` is 32, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` are both 0, reflecting that all counts have been fully decremented, and `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` represent the total counts of 0s and 1s across all 32 bits.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all 32 iterations, the variable `i` will be 33 (though it doesn't affect the final state of `suf` and `pre`), `y` and `c` will be undefined because they refer to indices out of bounds, `k` will be 5 (the bit length of `y` minus 1), `ans` will be the accumulated sum calculated during the loop, and for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will be 0, indicating no more counts left to decrement. The `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` will hold the total counts of 0s and 1s across all 32 bits processed.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
