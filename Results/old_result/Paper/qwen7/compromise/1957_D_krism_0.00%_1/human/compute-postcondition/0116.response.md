Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `pre[j][0]` is `pre[j][0] + 1`, `suf[j][0]` is `suf[j][0] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
