Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(32)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 31
   - `n` is 31
   - `cur` is `prefix[31]`
   - `j` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 32

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop condition is `for j in range(32)`. This means the loop will run from `j = 0` to `j = 31`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop runs up to 31, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Post-Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The postcondition for the next iteration should reflect `j` being 1 and `n` remaining 31.
   - The values of `i`, `cur`, and the condition involving `suf[0][1]` and `suf[0][0]` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop itself.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 32**
