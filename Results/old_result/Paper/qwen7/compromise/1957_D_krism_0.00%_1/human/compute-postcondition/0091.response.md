Output State: **`cur` is an integer which is 29, `j` is 32, and `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31: if the bit at position `j` in `cur` (which is 29) is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is 32; if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is 32.**

Explanation: The loop iterates 32 times because `j` ranges from 0 to 31. Each time the loop runs, it checks the j-th bit of `cur` (which is initially 29). Since `cur` is 29, its binary representation is `11101`. This means only the 0th, 1st, 4th, and 5th bits (from the right) are 1. For these positions, `suf[j][1]` will be incremented 32 times (once for each iteration of the loop), making it 32. For all other positions, since the bit is 0, `suf[j][0]` will also be incremented 32 times, making it 32. After 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, and the loop will terminate.
