Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 1, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was false for all iterations, and `suf[0][0]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Since `j` starts at 0 (as per the initial state), `suf[0][0]` is incremented by 1. All other values of `j` from 1 to 31 remain unchanged as no operation is performed on them. Therefore, `j` is updated to 1, and `suf[0][0]` is incremented.
