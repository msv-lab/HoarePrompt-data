Output State: **`i` is 30; `n` is 31; `cur` is `prefix[30]`; `j` is 31; `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, if `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was true for any iteration, `suf[j][1]` is the count of such occurrences, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is the count.**

Explanation: The code `cur = prefix[i]` assigns the value of `prefix[30]` to the variable `cur`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `suf`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
