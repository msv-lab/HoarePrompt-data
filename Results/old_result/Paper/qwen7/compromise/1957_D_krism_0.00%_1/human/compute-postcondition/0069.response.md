Output State: `i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 32, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31:
- If the bit at position `j` in `cur` (which is `prefix[30]`) is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was true.
- If the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was false.

This means that after all 32 iterations of the loop, the variable `j` will have reached 32 (beyond the loop's range), and the matrix `suf` will contain the counts of how many times each bit in `prefix[30]` was found to be 1 or 0. Specifically, `suf[j][1]` will hold the count of bits set to 1 at position `j`, and `suf[j][0]` will hold the count of bits set to 0 at position `j` for every `j` from 0 to 31.
