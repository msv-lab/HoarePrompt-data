Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` in the range `range(32)`. This means the loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = 31`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 30
   - `n` is 31
   - `cur` is `prefix[30]`
   - `j` is 0 (since it was the end of the previous iteration)
   - `suf` is a 32x2 matrix.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(32)`, the next value of `j` would be `j = 1`.
   - The other variables (`i`, `n`, `cur`, and `suf`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 1, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix**
