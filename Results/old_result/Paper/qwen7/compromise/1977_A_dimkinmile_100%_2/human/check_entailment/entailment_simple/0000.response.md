### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, which are read using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` checks whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases where `n` and `m` are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).
   - It correctly determines whether it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity and value of `n - m`.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: "Yes" or "No" without quotes, and each letter can be in any case.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic and handles all specified cases, the provided program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
