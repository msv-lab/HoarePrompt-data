### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
   
3. **Logic Check**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
     - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it means we can achieve `m` cubes by performing a series of additions and subtractions.
     - If the difference is even, it means we can balance the operations to get exactly `m` cubes.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case based on the logic implemented.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
