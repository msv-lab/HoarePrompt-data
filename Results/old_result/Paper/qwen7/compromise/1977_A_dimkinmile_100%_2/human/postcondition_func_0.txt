The function processes two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) and a positive integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \)). It checks if the difference \( n - m \) is even and non-negative. If true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but outputs 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition.
