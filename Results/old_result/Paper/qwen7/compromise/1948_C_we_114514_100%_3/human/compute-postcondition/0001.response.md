Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even, `row1` and `row2` remain strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'**.

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, while `n`, `row1`, and `row2` retain their original properties and values.
