### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to validate the original assessment.

#### Function 1 Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

1. **Condition Checks**:
   - The loop iterates over the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`).
   - For each position `i`, it checks if the arrow in the first row at position `2 * i + 1` is `<` and if either the arrow in the second row at positions `2 * i` or `2 * i + 2` is also `<`.
   - If both conditions are met, it returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last arrow in the first row is `<` and the second-to-last arrow in the second row is `<`. If both are true, it returns 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The condition checks are overly restrictive and do not cover all valid paths the robot can take.
   - The function does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the arrows.
   - The function assumes that if certain conditions are met, the robot cannot reach the target cell, which is not always true.

#### Function 2 Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - Calls `func_1(n, row1, row2)` and stores the result.
   - Prints the results for all test cases.

2. **Overall Logic**:
   - The function processes each test case correctly by reading the necessary inputs and calling `func_1`.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the example grid:
```
>>><
><>>
```
- Starting at (1, 1), the robot moves to (1, 2) and then to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), the robot moves to (2, 3) and then to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), the robot moves to (1, 4) and then to (2, 4).

This path shows that the robot can indeed reach (2, 4), but the provided solution would incorrectly return 'No' because it checks conditions that do not account for the actual path the robot can take.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all potential cases. The function `func_1` makes overly restrictive assumptions and does not simulate the robot's movement accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
