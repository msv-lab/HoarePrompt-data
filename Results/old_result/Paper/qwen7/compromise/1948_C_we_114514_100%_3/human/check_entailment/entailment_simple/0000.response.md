Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the given rows of arrows.
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `n // 2 - 1`) and checks if the robot can be blocked from moving to the next column due to the arrows pointing left.
   - If at any point, the robot encounters a situation where it cannot move rightward due to arrows pointing left, it returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks the last two cells to ensure the robot can move from the last column to `(2, n)`.
   - If the conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The problem specifies that `n` is even, which is handled correctly in the code.
   - The function logic seems to cover all the necessary conditions to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.

4. **Execution States:**
   - The provided comments describe the state transitions accurately.
   - The function calls and loops are consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
