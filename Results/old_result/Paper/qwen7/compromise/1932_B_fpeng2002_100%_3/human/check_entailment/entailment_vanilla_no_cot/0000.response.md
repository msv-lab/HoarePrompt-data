Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the year when the nth sign will occur. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `start_year`:**
   - The current implementation of `start_year` calculation does not correctly handle the sequential occurrence of signs. It only considers the last sign's periodicity without accounting for the cumulative effect of previous signs.
   - The logic `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is incorrect because it doesn't properly align with the sequential occurrence requirement.

2. **Proper Solution Approach:**
   - To find the year when the nth sign will occur, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities. This LCM will give us the smallest year in which all signs will occur sequentially.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        # Calculate LCM of all periodicities
        result = reduce(lcm, nums)
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the `lcm` function to compute the least common multiple of all periodicities, ensuring that the nth sign occurs in the correct year according to the sequential occurrence requirement.
