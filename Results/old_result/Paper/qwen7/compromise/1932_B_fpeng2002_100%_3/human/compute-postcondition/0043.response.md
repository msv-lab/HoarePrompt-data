Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `start_year` is initialized to some value (let's call it `S`).
   - `nums` is a list of integers.
   - The loop iterates over each index `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - For each iteration, the value of `start_year` is updated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, the value of `start_year` is updated.
   - Let's denote the initial value of `start_year` as `S`.
   - After the first iteration (`x = 0`), `start_year` becomes `(S // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`.
   - After the second iteration (`x = 1`), `start_year` becomes `((S // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
   - This process continues until `x = len(nums) - 1`.

3. **Final Value**:
   - After all iterations, `start_year` will have gone through the transformation defined by the formula for each element in `nums`.
   - The final value of `start_year` will be the result of the last application of the formula with `x = len(nums) - 1`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will output the final value of `start_year`.

Given the nature of the problem, without knowing the exact values of `start_year` and `nums`, we can describe the final value of `start_year` in a general form.

Output: **(start_year // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]**
