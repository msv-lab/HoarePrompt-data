Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `start_year` will be the result of applying the operation \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]\) for each index \(x\) from 0 to \(len(nums) - 1\).

To understand this, consider that in each iteration of the loop, the value of `start_year` is updated based on the current value of `nums[x]`. Specifically, `start_year` is recalculated as \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]\). This process is repeated for every element in the list `nums`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `nums` exactly once, the final value of `start_year` will be the result of applying this operation sequentially to each element in the list. In simpler terms, `start_year` will be transformed according to the rule given by the loop body for each element in `nums`.

For example, if `nums` is `[2, 3, 4]` and `start_year` initially is 12, then after the first iteration (`x=0`), `start_year` becomes \((12 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 14\). After the second iteration (`x=1`), it becomes \((14 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 15\). And finally, after the third iteration (`x=2`), it becomes \((15 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 16\).

Thus, the final `start_year` after all iterations will be the result of applying the given operation to each element in `nums` in sequence.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `x` is `len(nums) - 1`; `start_year` is ((((start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] // nums[3] + 1) * nums[3] if there are 4 numbers in the list, or similarly reduced for fewer numbers.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the list `nums` minus one, indicating that the loop has processed each element in the list. The variable `start_year` will hold the final value calculated by successively applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the list, starting from the first element and moving towards the last one.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `start_year` is the result of applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, and `x` is `len(nums)`.

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop iterates over each index `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
- For each iteration, the value of `start_year` is updated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- After all iterations, `x` will be equal to `len(nums)`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The final value of `start_year` is the result of sequentially applying the given operation for each element in `nums`.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `start_year` has been updated through the specified operations for all elements in `nums`, and `x` is equal to the length of `nums`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
