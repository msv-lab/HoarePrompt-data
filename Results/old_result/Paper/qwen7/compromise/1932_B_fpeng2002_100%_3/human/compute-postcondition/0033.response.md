Output State: **`x` is an input list split from a string, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `start_year` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `start_year` to 0. This does not affect the values of `x`, `num_tests`, or `n`. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.
