Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `x < len(nums)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 0.
   - `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, making it `x = 1`.
   - The value of `start_year` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body and its value is determined before the loop starts.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `x` will be 1.
   - `start_year` will remain as `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`x` is 1, `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`**.
