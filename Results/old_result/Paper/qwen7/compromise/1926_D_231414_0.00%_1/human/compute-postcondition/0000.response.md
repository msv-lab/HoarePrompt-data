Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `times` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer input from the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the code only affects `times`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is still valid.
