Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `times`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, we only need to focus on `times`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `times` is an input integer and `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `check` is 2147483647.

4. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0. Given that `times` is an input integer and \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already guaranteed that `times` is a positive integer and thus greater than 0.

5. **Conclusion**: Since `times` is already in a valid state to ensure the loop can execute, no adjustment is needed for `times`. However, we should also mention that `check` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647**
