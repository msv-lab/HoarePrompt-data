Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5); y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; n, x, and y are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now known and specific to the input provided, while `t` retains its initial condition.
