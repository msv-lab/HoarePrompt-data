Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a value or values based on the given constraints and input data for each test case.**

This means the function `func_1` processes input data which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is between 1 and \(10^4\), `x` is between 4 and \(min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\), and `y` is between 0 and \(n - x\). Additionally, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. The function then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns the result(s) accordingly.
