Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `same_value_count` is 0, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f-1` in the list `a`, `n` retains its original value, `f` retains its original value, `k` retains its original value, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `greater_count` is either 0 or equal to the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `same_value_count` is 1, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f-1` in the list `a`, `n` retains its original value, `f` retains its original value, `k` retains its original value, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `greater_count` is either 0 or equal to the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 0, and the first element of `a` is equal to `favorite_value`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `same_value_count` is either 1 or 2, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f-1` in the list `a`, `n` retains its original value, `f` retains its original value, `k` retains its original value, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `greater_count` is either 0 or equal to the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 0, and the next element of `a` is the value of `value` in the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The value of `same_value_count` is incremented by 1 if `value` equals `favorite_value`. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
