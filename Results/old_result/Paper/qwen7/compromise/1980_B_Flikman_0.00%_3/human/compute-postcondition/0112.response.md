Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the first element). The value of `value` is the second element of the original list `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is increased by 1. If `value` is not equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.
