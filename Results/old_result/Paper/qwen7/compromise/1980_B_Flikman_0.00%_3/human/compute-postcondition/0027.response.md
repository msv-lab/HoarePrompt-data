Postcondition: `greater_count` is either 0 or 1, `same_value_count` is the total number of times the element at index `f-1` (i.e., `favorite_value`) appears in the list `a_i`, the variable `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 0, `n`, `f`, and `k` retain their original input values, and `a` must contain at least one element. If the `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `greater_count` remains unchanged.
