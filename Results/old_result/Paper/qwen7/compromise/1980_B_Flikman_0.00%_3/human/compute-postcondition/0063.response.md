Postcondition: `same_value_count` is either 1 or 2, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f-1` in the list `a`, `n` retains its original value, `f` retains its original value, `k` retains its original value, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `greater_count` is either 0 or equal to the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 0, and the next element of `a` is the value of `value` in the next iteration.

This postcondition states that after executing the if-else block, `same_value_count` will be either 1 (unchanged) or 2 (increased by 1 if the condition is met), while other variables retain their original values and the list `a` and its properties remain consistent with the initial state.
