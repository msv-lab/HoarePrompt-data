Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_i` are yet to be determined.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    same_value_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value == favorite_value:
            same_value_count += 1
    greater_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value > favorite_value:
            greater_count += 1
    if greater_count >= k:
        print('YES')
    elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `greater_count` is either 0 or equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is the total number of times the element at index `f-1` (i.e., `favorite_value`) appears in the list `a`, the variable `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 0, `n`, `f`, and `k` retain their original input values, and the list `a` is now an empty list since all its elements have been processed. Additionally, if `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition `(greater_count >= k)` is true; otherwise, `greater_count` is less than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `greater_count` is equal to the number of elements in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is equal to the total number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f-1` in the list `a`, `n` retains its original value, `f` retains its original value, `k` retains its original value, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 0, and if `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, if `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `greater_count` will be the total number of elements in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is adjusted to be equal to `greater_count + same_value_count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
