Output State: **`ans` is updated by appending 'a[bets-1]' to its current value plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is now `bets`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is equal to `bets`) followed by a space. It also increments `i` to be equal to `bets`. The initial state where `ans` was updated by appending 'a[bets-1]' remains valid, but now it includes the additional string representation of `a[i]` (which is `a[bets]` since `i` is now `bets`).
