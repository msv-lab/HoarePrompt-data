Output State: **`ans` is updated by appending 'a[bets-1]' to its current value, `i` is `bets - 1`, `bets` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is `bets - 1`) followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. The value of `i` remains `bets - 1`, and `bets` must be greater than 0 as per the initial state.
