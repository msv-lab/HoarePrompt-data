Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `prod`. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the integers in the list. The values of `bets`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
