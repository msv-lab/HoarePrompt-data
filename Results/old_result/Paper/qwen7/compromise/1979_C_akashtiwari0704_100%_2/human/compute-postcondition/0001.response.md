State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, T is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `T` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. The loop condition is `range(t)`, which means the loop will run from `T = 0` to `T = t - 1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.
4. The initial value of `T` is 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and within the given range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `T` should be set to its initial value of 0.
