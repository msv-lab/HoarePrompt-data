Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `sumo` to 0. This does not affect the values of `bets`, `i`, `a`, or `prod`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `sumo` is explicitly set to 0.
