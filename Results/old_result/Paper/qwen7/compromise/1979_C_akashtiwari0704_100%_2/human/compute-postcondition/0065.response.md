Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sumo` is `0 + prod // a[i] + int(a[i])`
   - `bets` must be greater than 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`
   - `a[i]` is unchanged

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (assuming `i` starts from 0).
   - The value of `bets` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - `a[i]` is unchanged, so it remains `prod // a[i]`.
   - `sumo` is derived from `prod // a[i]` and `int(a[i])`, but since `a[i]` is unchanged, `sumo` does not change.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` must be 3 for the loop to continue.
   - `bets` must still be greater than 1.
   - `a[i]` remains unchanged.
   - `sumo` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sumo` is `0 + prod // a[i] + int(a[i])`, `bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `a[i]` is unchanged**
