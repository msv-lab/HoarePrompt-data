Functionality: **The function accepts a list `l`. It calculates the product of all elements in `l` and then divides this product by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of this product and each element in `l` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `len(l)-1`. The function returns the final value of `g`. Additionally, `i` is equal to `len(l)`.**
