Output State: **`sumo` is 0 + `prod // a[i]`, `bets` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to its current value. Given that `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, the new value of `sumo` becomes `0 + (prod // a[i])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
