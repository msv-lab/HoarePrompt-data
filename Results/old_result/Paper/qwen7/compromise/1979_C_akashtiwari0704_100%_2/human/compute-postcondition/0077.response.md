Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 'a[0]a[1] ', `bets` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently 1) to `ans` followed by a space. Initially, `ans` is `'a[0]'`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), `ans` becomes `'a[0]a[1] '`, and `bets` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
