Output State: **The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `l`, denoted as `g`.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is the product of all elements in the list `l`, but each multiplication step also divides by the greatest common divisor of `g` and the current element, ensuring that `g` remains the GCD of all elements processed so far. The code snippet `return g` simply returns this computed GCD.
