Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < bets`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `ans` is a string containing `str(a[0])` followed by `str(a[1])` and a space.
   - `bets` is a non-negative integer that satisfies `bets < len(a) + 2*bets - 3`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `bets` must still satisfy the condition `bets > i` (since `i` is now 4, `bets` must be greater than 4).

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 4.
- `bets` must be greater than 4.

The value of `ans` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**`i` is 4, `ans` is a string containing `str(a[0])` followed by `str(a[1])` and a space, `bets` must be greater than 4**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 4, `ans` is a string containing `str(a[0])` followed by `str(a[1])` and a space, `bets` must be greater than 4**.
