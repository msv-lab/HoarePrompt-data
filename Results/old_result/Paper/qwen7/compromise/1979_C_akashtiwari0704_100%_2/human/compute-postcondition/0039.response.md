Output State: **The value of `ans` will be a string containing the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = bets - 1`. In each iteration, the current element `a[i]` is converted to a string and appended to `ans` followed by a space. After `bets` iterations, `ans` will contain all elements of `a` concatenated together with spaces in between. Since the loop runs for `bets` times, and `bets` is initially set to the length of `a`, `ans` will end up as a single string with all elements of `a` listed out.
