Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list `l` can form a progressive square based on the provided values of `n`, `c`, and `d`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the expected values of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` where `a` is the minimum value in `l`.
   - It then sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` and checks if they are equal.
   - If they are equal, it means the elements in `l` match the expected values of the progressive square, so it returns 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The nested loops run through all possible indices `k` and `h` to generate the list `li`.
   - The state before the function call is correctly described, and the logic within the function is consistent with the problem's requirements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the generation of the progressive square correctly.
   - Sorting both lists ensures that the order of elements does not affect the comparison.
   - The function correctly identifies whether the input list `l` matches the expected values of the progressive square.

Given the logic and the steps described, the function `func_1` correctly determines whether the input list `l` can form a progressive square based on the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

Correctness: **True**
