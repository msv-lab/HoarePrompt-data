You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts four parameters: an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \)), two integers \( c \) and \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6 \)), and a list \( l \) of \( n^2 \) integers (where \( 1 \leq l[i] \leq 10^9 \) for all \( i \)). It generates a new list \( li \) based on the minimum value of \( l \) and the parameters \( c \) and \( d \), sorts both \( l \) and \( li \), and compares them. If the sorted lists are identical, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `c`, and `d` of the progressive square.
   - It also reads the array `l` of length `n^2`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the given array `l` can form a progressive square with the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It calculates the minimum value `a` in the array `l`.
   - It then generates the expected progressive square values using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all positions `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input array `l` are sorted.
   - Finally, it checks if the sorted lists match and returns 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for generating the progressive square values is correct. The formula `a + k * c + d * h` ensures that each element in the matrix is uniquely determined by its position `(k, h)`.
   - Sorting both lists before comparison is necessary because the input array `l` may contain the elements in any order.
   - The function correctly identifies whether the input array can form the required progressive square.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the input constraints appropriately.
   - The function works correctly for all given examples in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can confirm that it correctly implements the logic to check if the given array can form a progressive square with the specified parameters.
