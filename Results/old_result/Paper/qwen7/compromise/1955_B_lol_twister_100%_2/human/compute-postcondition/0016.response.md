Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for h in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `h` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `li` is a list with one element which is `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive.
   - `h` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `h` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition does not depend on `h` changing `n`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `li` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `h` is now 1.
   - `n` remains within the range of 2 to 500 inclusive.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`li` is a list with one element which is `a + k * c + d * h`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 1**
