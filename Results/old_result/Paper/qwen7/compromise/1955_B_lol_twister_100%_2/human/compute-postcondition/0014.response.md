Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `h` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `h` will be 0 initially because the loop starts with `h` in the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `h` will start at 0, we need to ensure that `h` is 0.
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, so we need to ensure that `n` falls within this range.

4. **Consider the list `li`**:
   - The list `li` is defined based on the value of `h` in the range `0` to `n-1`. However, the state of `li` itself does not need to be adjusted; it is derived from the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `h` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`h` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive**
