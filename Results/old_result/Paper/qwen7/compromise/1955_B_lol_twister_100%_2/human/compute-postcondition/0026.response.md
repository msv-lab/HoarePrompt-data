Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for h in range(0, n)`. The only variable that changes within each iteration of the loop is `h`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `li` has a new element which is the value of `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - The values of `a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, and `h` remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `h` is less than `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `h` was incremented by 1 from its previous value.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` was incremented by 1, the new value of `h` will be the previous value of `h` plus 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `h` must be less than `n`.

Given that `h` was incremented by 1, let's denote the previous value of `h` as `h_prev`. Therefore, the new value of `h` is `h_prev + 1`.

Since the values of `a`, `k`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, they do not need to be adjusted.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `li` has a new element which is the value of `a + k * c + d * (h_prev + 1)`.
- `h` is now `h_prev + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

However, since we only need to provide the state adjustments for the loop head variables, the relevant adjustments are:

State: **`li` has a new element which is the value of `a + k * c + d * (h + 1)`, and `h` is `h + 1`**.

To be more precise and match the format:
State: **`li` has a new element which is the value of `a + k * c + d * (h + 1)`, and `h` is `h + 1`**.
