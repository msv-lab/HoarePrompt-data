Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9 for all i; `li` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n):
    for h in range(0, n):
        li.append(a + k * c + d * h)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 299 (since the loop runs from 0 to n-1), `li` is a list containing the values `a + k * c + d * h` for each `h` in the range of `0` to `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `k` remains 0, `n` still must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` will be 299 because the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` contains 500 elements, each being the value of the expression `a + k * c + d * h` for every integer `h` from 0 up to 499 (since `n` is 500).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `li` contains 500 elements, each of which is equal to `a + k * c + 499 * d`. The variable `n` is 500, `h` ranges from 0 to 499, and both `k` and `d` retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `li` will contain 1000 elements. Each element in `li` will be calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `h` ranges from 0 to 499 for the first 500 elements, and from 500 to 999 for the next 500 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
