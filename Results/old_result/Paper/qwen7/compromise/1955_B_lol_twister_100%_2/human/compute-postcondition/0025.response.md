Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for h in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `h` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `li` has a new element which is the value of `a + k * c + d * h`, and the values of `a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, and `h` remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `h` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `h` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `h` will be `h + 1`. Also, since `n` remains unchanged, it will still be the same as before.

5. **New State**: Given that `h` is incremented by 1, the new value of `h` will be `h + 1`. The other variables (`a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `li` has a new element which is the value of `a + k * c + d * (h + 1)`, and the values of `a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
