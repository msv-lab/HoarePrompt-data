Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined as `for h in range(0, n):`. The only variable in the loop head is `h`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `h` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `li` contains the value of `a + k * c + d * (h + 1)`
   - `h` is `h + 1`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `h` will be `h + 1`.
   - The value of `li` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

5. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be less than `n`. Given that `h` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `h` should be checked against `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `li` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `h` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `h` is `h + 1`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `h + 1` must be less than `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`li` contains the value of `a + k * c + d * (h + 1)`, and `h` is `h + 1`**. For the loop to execute one more time, `h + 1` must be less than `n`.
