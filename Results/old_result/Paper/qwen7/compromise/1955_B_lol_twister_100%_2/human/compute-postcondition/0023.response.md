Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for h in range(0, n)`. The objects involved here are `h` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `h` is the variable that iterates over the range from 0 to 499 (since `n` is 500).
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range, which is given as 500.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `h` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `h` should be 0.
   - The value of `n` should be set to 500 to ensure the loop runs from 0 to 499.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `h` and `n`.

**State:**
**`h` is 0, `n` is 500**
