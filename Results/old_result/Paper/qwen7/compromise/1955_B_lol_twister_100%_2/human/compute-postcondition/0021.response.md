Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the range for `k` as `range(0, n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The list `li` contains 500 elements.
   - Each element in `li` is calculated as `a + k * c + 499 * d`.
   - The variable `n` is 500.
   - The variable `h` ranges from 0 to 499.
   - Both `k` and `d` retain their initial values.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `k` from 0 to 499, at the end of the previous iteration, `k` would have been 499.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 500.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged at 500 because the loop range is fixed.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variables that change within the loop head are `k` and `n`. Since `n` does not change, it remains 500.
   - `k` needs to be 500 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `li` contains 500 elements, each of which is equal to `a + k * c + 499 * d`, `n` is 500, `h` ranges from 0 to 499, and `k` is 500.**
