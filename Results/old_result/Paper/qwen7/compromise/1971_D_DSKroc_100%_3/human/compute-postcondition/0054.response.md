Output State: **`i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is incremented by 1 if `int(s[i])` is not equal to `int(s[i + 1])`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged; `flag` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `flag` is assigned the value `1`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i` or `count`, which remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `flag` along with the unchanged values of `i` and `count`.
