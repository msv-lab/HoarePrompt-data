Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code does not accurately determine the minimum number of pieces required to sort the binary string.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Counting Adjacent Changes**: The `count` variable is incremented every time there is a change between adjacent characters. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of pieces.
2. **Flag Check**: The `flag` check is used to determine if the string is already sorted, but this alone is not enough to determine the minimum number of pieces.
3. **Handling Sorted Strings**: For strings that are already sorted, the solution correctly prints `count + 1`, which is incorrect because a sorted string requires at most 1 piece.
4. **General Logic**: The logic fails to handle cases where multiple changes are needed to separate different segments of '0's and '1's.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the points where the binary string changes from '0' to '1' or vice versa. Each such change indicates a potential cut point. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        last_char = s[0]
        
        for char in s:
            if char != last_char:
                count += 1
                last_char = char
        
        # If the string is already sorted, we need at most 1 piece
        if s[0] == '0' and s[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
        
        print(count)

# Example usage
func()
```

This approach counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1'. If the string starts with '0' and ends with '1', an additional piece is needed to ensure the entire string can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
