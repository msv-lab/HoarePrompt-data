Output State: **`s` is 0 + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` does not change the value of `x` since it is already assigned to `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
