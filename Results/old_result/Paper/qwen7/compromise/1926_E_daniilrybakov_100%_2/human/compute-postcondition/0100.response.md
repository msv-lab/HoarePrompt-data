Output State: **After all iterations, `s` will be the cumulative sum of `x` for each iteration until the condition `s >= k` or `k > s + x` is met, `n` will be 0, `m` will be \(2^t\) (where \(t\) is the total number of iterations), and `x` will be 1 since `n` becomes 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `s` will hold the total sum of values calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met, `n` will be reduced to 0 after being halved `t` times, `m` will be \(2^t\) as it doubles with each iteration, and `x` will be 1 because `n` becomes 0.
