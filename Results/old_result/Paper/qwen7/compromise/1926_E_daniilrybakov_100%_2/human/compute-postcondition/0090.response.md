Output State: **`s` is `x + (n + 1) // 2`, `n` must be non-zero, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is twice its original value, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` does not change the value of `s`, `n`, `m`, or the original value of `x`. It simply reassigns the value of `x` to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is already the value of `x` in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
