State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4`.
4. Therefore, `t` must satisfy both conditions: it must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(5 \cdot 10^4\).

Since the only variable involved in the loop head is `t`, and it directly controls the number of iterations, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.
