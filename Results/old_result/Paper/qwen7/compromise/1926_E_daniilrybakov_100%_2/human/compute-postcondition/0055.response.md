Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero (`n > 0`).

2. **Current State**: 
   - `s` is calculated as `0 + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`.
   - `n` is `n // 2`.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `m` is 4.
   - `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust `n`.

4. **Determine the New State**: To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is currently `n // 2`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is 0 + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**
