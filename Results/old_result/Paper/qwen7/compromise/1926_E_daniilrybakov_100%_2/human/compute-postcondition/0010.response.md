Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Additionally, since the `break` statement is executed, we indicate that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
