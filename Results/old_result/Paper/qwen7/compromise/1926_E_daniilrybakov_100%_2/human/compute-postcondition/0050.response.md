Output State: **`s` is 0 + (n + 1) // 2, `n` is n // 2, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `x` is (n + 1) // 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. All the variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
