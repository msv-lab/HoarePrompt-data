Output State: **`s` is 0, `n` is `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the condition `s < k and k <= s + x` was true before the `break` statement, the loop or conditional block is exited. None of the variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
