You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers t, n, and k. It calculates and prints a result based on the given conditions. Specifically, for each test case, it computes a value derived from n, k, and t, ensuring that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated result for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - `m` is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the value of the card.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - In each iteration:
     - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of cards that can be laid down in the current iteration.
     - `n` is halved (`n //= 2`), reducing the number of remaining cards.
     - If `s` (cumulative count) is less than `k` and `k` is within the range `[s, s + x]`, the loop breaks, indicating the correct segment for the `k`-th card is found.
     - Otherwise, `s` is updated by adding `x`, and `m` is doubled (`m *= 2`).

4. **Card Calculation:**
   - After exiting the loop, the program calculates the `k`-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula aims to find the `k`-th card in the sequence based on the cumulative count `s` and the multiplier `m`.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- For `n = 7` and `k = 1` to `7`:
  - The sequence of cards laid down is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
  - For `k = 1`, the card is 1.
  - For `k = 2`, the card is 3.
  - For `k = 3`, the card is 5.
  - For `k = 4`, the card is 7.
  - For `k = 5`, the card is 2.
  - For `k = 6`, the card is 6.
  - For `k = 7`, the card is 4.

The program correctly identifies these positions.

- For `n = 1` and `k = 1`:
  - The sequence is just 1.
  - The card is 1.

The program also handles this correctly.

- For larger values like `n = 34` and `k = 14`:
  - The sequence is more complex but the program should handle it correctly by breaking the loop at the right point and calculating the correct card.

Given the logic and the examples, the program appears to correctly implement the described algorithm.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th card laid down according to the specified rules.
