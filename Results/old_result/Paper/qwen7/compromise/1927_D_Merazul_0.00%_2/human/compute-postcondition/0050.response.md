Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < k + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `u` is False
   - `v` is False in 'b'
   - `f` is False
   - `m` is 1
   - `n` is 1

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k + 1`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2, so for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `k` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 2, `u` is False, `v` is False in 'b', `f` is False, `m` is 1, `n` is 1**
