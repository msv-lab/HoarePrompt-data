Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 2, `u` is False, `v` is False in 'b', `f` is False, `m` is 1, `n` is 1, `a` is not defined, so `u` remains False.**

The code `u = i in a` checks if `i` (which is 3) is in the list `a`. However, since `a` is not defined, the condition cannot be evaluated, and `u` remains False. All other variables remain unchanged.
