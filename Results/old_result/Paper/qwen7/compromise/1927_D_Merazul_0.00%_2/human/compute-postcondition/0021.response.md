Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` is the second element returned by `R()`
   - `u` is True
   - `v` is False
   - `f` is True
   - `m` is `m - 1`
   - `n` is `n + 1`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is determined by the function `R()` and not modified within the loop.
   - `u`, `v`, `f`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `k` is the second element returned by `R()`, `u` is True, `v` is False, `f` is True, `m` is `m - 1`, `n` is `n + 1`**
