Output State: **`m` is 1, `u` is False, `v` is False**.

Explanation: The code `m -= u & ~v` updates the value of `m` by subtracting the result of `u & ~v` from it. Given that `u` is `False` and `v` is `False`, `~v` (bitwise NOT of `v`) results in `True` (since `~False` is `True`). The expression `u & True` evaluates to `False` because `False & anything` is `False`. Therefore, `m` remains unchanged at `1`. The values of `u` and `v` are not affected by this operation.
