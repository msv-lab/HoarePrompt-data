Output State: **`f` is False, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 2, `u` is False, `v` is False, `m` is 1, `n` is 1, `a` is not defined, `b` is not defined**

Explanation: The expression `f &= u | v` updates the value of `f`. Here, `u` is False and `v` is False, so `u | v` evaluates to False. Since `f` was initially False, `f &= False` results in `f` remaining False. All other variables remain unchanged.
