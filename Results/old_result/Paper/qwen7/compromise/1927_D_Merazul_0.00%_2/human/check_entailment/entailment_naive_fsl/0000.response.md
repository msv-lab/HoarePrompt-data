Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to solve a different problem involving set operations and does not address the task of finding pairs of different elements within specified query ranges.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the provided program will output something entirely different because it does not correctly handle the query ranges and check for different elements within those ranges. For example, for the query `1 5`, the program should find indices 2 and 3 (where `a[2] = 2` and `a[3] = 1`), but instead, it performs set operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
