Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n + r + 1` is derived from the condition where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be executed is `print(1, j, end=' ')`.

Given that `j` is explicitly stated to be 1, we need to determine the value of `n + r + 1`. However, without knowing the specific values of `n` and `r`, we cannot compute the exact value of `n + r + 1`. But we know that `j` is 1 and it is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the number 1 followed by the value of `j`, which is 1, with no newline character due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **1 1**
