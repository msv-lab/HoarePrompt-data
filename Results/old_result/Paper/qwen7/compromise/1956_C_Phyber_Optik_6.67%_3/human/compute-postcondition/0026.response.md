To determine what will be printed, let's break down the logic step by step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We start with a loop that iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - For each `i`, we check the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to checking if \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} > i * n\).

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - As long as the condition holds true, `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - Once the condition fails (`n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`), `sum` is incremented by `i * n` for the remaining iterations until `i = n`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - `r` will be the largest `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `sum` will be the cumulative sum based on the condition mentioned.

Given this, let's analyze the final values of `sum` and `n + r`:

- **`r`**: The largest `i` such that \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} > i * n\). This means \(r = \left\lfloor \sqrt{\frac{2n}{n+1}} \right\rfloor\).
- **`sum`**: The sum will be the sum of \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) for all `i` where the condition holds true, plus the sum of `i * n` for the remaining `i`.

For simplicity, let's assume `n = 5` (you can generalize this for any `n`):

- When `n = 5`, \(\frac{5(5+1)}{2} = 15\).
- The loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = 5`.
- For `i = 1` to `i = 4`, the condition `15 > i * 5` holds true, so `sum` will be incremented by `15` four times.
- For `i = 5`, the condition fails (`15 <= 5 * 5`), so `sum` will be incremented by `5 * 5 = 25`.

Thus, `sum = 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 25 = 80`.

- `r` will be `4` because it is the largest `i` for which the condition holds true.

Therefore, the final output will be:

Output: **80, 9**
