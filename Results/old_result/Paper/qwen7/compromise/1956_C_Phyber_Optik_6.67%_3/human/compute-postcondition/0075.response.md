Output State: **i is n, r is the largest integer such that r * n < n * (n + 1) / 2, and sum is the sum of n * (n + 1) // 2 for each iteration where n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n, otherwise sum is the sum of i * n for those iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the original value of `n`, `r` will be the largest integer such that `r * n < n * (n + 1) / 2`, and `sum` will contain the cumulative sum based on the conditions specified within the loop.
