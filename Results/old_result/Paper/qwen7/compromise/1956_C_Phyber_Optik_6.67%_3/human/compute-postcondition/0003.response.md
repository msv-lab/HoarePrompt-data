Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `sum` and `r`, both set to 0. The conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and `n` remains an input integer.
