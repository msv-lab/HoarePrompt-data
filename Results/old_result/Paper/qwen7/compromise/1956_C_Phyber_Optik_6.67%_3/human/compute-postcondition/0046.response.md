Given the initial state where `j` is 3 and `n` is a positive integer, we need to determine the value of `j % n` and then format the output accordingly.

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified. However, the modulo operation `%` will still work with any positive integer value for `n`.

The expression `j % n` calculates the remainder when `j` (which is 3) is divided by `n`.

Let's consider the possible outcomes for `j % n`:

- If `n` is 1, then `3 % 1` is 0.
- If `n` is 2, then `3 % 2` is 1.
- If `n` is 3, then `3 % 3` is 0.
- If `n` is greater than 3, then `3 % n` will be 3 if `n` is 4, 5, 6, etc., because 3 is less than these values.

Since `n` is a positive integer and its exact value is not specified, we can represent the result of `j % n` as `3 % n`.

The `end=' '` in the `print` function ensures that the next print statement will be on the same line, separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2, 3 % n end=' '**
