Output State: After all iterations, `sum` will be the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` will be 0 since it starts from 1 and gets decremented to 0 after all iterations, `t` will be the initial number of remaining iterations minus the number of iterations executed, `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `i` will be `n` since it starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until `n` becomes 0.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `sum` will contain the final accumulated value based on the loop's conditions, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` will be 0, `t` will reflect the remaining iterations, `r` will be the last valid `i` or 0, and `i` will be `n`.
