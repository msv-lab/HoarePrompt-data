Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is an integer, `r` is equal to `i`.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `r`. The initial values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2) > i * n` is not directly affected by this assignment, so it remains true as per the initial state.
