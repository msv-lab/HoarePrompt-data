To solve this problem, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`j` is 2**: This is straightforward; `j = 2`.
2. **`n + r + 1` is the value derived from the condition \( r \) being the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \)**:
   - We need to find the value of `r` first.
   - The formula given is \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Rearrange the inequality to solve for \( r \):
     \[
     r < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2n} = \frac{n + 1}{2}
     \]
   - Since \( r \) must be an integer, \( r \) is the largest integer less than \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \).

Given that `j` is 2, let's assume `n` is some value and determine `r`.

For example, if `n = 3`:
- Calculate \( \frac{n + 1}{2} = \frac{3 + 1}{2} = 2 \).
- The largest integer less than 2 is 1, so \( r = 1 \).
- Therefore, \( n + r + 1 = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \).

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

This will print the range of numbers from 1 to `n + 1`.

### Determining the Value of `n`:
From the initial state, we know that \( n + r + 1 = 5 \). If \( r = 1 \), then \( n = 3 \).

### Final Output:
Given \( n = 3 \), the range function will generate the sequence from 1 to 4. Thus, the output will be:
```
1 2 3 4
```

Output: **1 2 3 4**
