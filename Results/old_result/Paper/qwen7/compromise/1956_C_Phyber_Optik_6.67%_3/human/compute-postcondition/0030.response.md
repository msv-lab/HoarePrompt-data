Given the initial state where `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly, and the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`, we need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(*range(1, n + 1))`.

Let's break it down:

1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print these numbers separated by spaces.

Since `n` is explicitly stated to be a positive integer, we don't have a specific value for `n`, but we know it will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n** (where `n` is a positive integer)
