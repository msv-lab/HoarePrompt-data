Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer.
- `j` is `j_start + 2`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `2`:**
   - This is a constant value, so it will be printed as `2`.

2. **Value of `j % n`:**
   - `j` is defined as `j_start + 2`.
   - `j % n` means the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
   - Since `j = j_start + 2`, the expression becomes `(j_start + 2) % n`.
   - Without knowing the exact value of `j_start`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `(j_start + 2) % n`. However, we know it will be a non-negative integer less than `n`.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 [remainder when (j_start + 2) is divided by n] (where j_start is an integer)**

To make it more precise and understandable:
Output: **2, remainder when (j_start + 2) is divided by n (where j_start is an integer)**
