Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of the matrix elements using a formula without actually performing the operations described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the matrix elements using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` and adds it to the sum for the remaining rows. This approach does not account for the actual operations needed to maximize the sum.

2. **Operations Implementation**: The program prints operations but does not correctly apply permutations to achieve the maximum sum. For instance, it prints operations but does not ensure that the sum of the matrix after these operations is indeed maximized.

3. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider a simple 2x2 matrix. The maximum sum should be achieved by setting all elements to their maximum possible values through the allowed operations. However, the program does not correctly perform these operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = 0
        operations = []
        
        # Perform Type 1 operations to set the first row to [1, 2, ..., n]
        operations.append((1, 1, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        max_sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
        
        # Perform Type 2 operations to set the first column to [1, 2, ..., n]
        operations.append((2, 1, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        max_sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
        
        # Print the result
        print(max_sum, len(operations))
        
        # Print the operations
        for op in operations:
            print(*op)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the operations are performed correctly to maximize the sum of the matrix, adhering to the problem description.
