### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) initially filled with zeros.
- Two types of operations can be performed:
  - Type 1: Permute the elements of a chosen row.
  - Type 2: Permute the elements of a chosen column.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func()` processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed.
- It then prints the sum and a sequence of operations.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   ```
   This reads the number of test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       n = int(input())
       (sum, r) = (0, 0)
   ```
   For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \) and initializes variables for the sum and the number of full rows \( r \).

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
           r = i
           sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
       else:
           sum += i * n
   ```
   This loop calculates the sum of the matrix. The idea is to fill the top \( r \) rows with the largest possible values (from \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) to \( n \)), and the remaining rows with the next largest values (from \( 1 \) to \( n \)).

4. **Printing the Sum and Operations**:
   ```python
   print(sum, n + r)
   for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
       if j <= n:
           print(1, j, end=' ')
           print(*range(1, n + 1))
       else:
           print(2, j % n, end=' ')
           print(*range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   - The sum and the number of operations \( n + r \) are printed.
   - The operations are printed in the required format. The first \( n \) operations are row permutations, and the remaining \( r \) operations are column permutations.

#### Verification:
- **Sum Calculation**:
  - The sum calculation logic seems correct. By filling the top \( r \) rows with the largest possible values and the remaining rows with the next largest values, the sum is maximized.
- **Operations**:
  - The operations are correctly formatted and do not exceed \( 2n \) in total.
  - Row permutations (Type 1) and column permutations (Type 2) are correctly implemented.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem statement.
