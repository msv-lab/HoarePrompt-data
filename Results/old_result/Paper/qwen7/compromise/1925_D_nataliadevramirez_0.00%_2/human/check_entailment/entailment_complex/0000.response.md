### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
   - It iterates through each friendship pair and adds the product of the friendship value `f` and the combination of `k` taken 2 at a time (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) to the result.
   - The result is then returned modulo `MOD` (which is \(10^9 + 7\)).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
   - It then reads the list of friendships and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - Finally, it prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program structure is correct and follows the problem description.
   - The logic in both functions is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - There are no logical errors or missing parts that would cause the program to fail.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
