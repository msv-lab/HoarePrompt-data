Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair. Instead, it assumes that each pair is chosen with equal probability, which is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to calculate the probability of each pair being chosen and then use that probability to compute the expected value. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import comb

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    result = 0
    
    # Calculate the probability of each pair being chosen
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        prob = (comb(total_pairs - 1, k - 1) * comb(1, 0) / comb(total_pairs, k)) * f
        result += prob % MOD
    
    return int(result % MOD)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)
```

This corrected function properly calculates the expected value by considering the probability of each pair being chosen.
