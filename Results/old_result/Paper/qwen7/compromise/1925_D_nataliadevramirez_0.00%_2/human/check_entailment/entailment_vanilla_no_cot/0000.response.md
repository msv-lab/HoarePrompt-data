To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. **Friendship Value Increase**: If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
3. **Output**: The result should be in the form \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and the output should be \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Given Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the contribution of each friendship to the total sum.
  - It iterates over each friendship and adds the product of the friendship value (`f`) and the number of ways to pick the pair in `k` excursions, which is \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).
  - The result is then taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
- **Function `func_2`**: This function handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Calculation of Contribution**:
   - For each friendship, the number of times the pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).
   - This part of the calculation is correct.
2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is correctly taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  100 0 24
  ```
- Output: 
  ```
  0
  ```
- Explanation: No friendships, so the result is 0.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: 
  ```
  2 1 1
  1 2 1
  ```
- Output: 
  ```
  55
  ```
- Explanation: Only one pair (1, 2) with initial friendship value 1. Each excursion increases the value by 1, so the total sum is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 10 = 55 \).

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: 
  ```
  5 2 4
  1 2 25
  3 2 24
  ```
- Output: 
  ```
  777777784
  ```
- Explanation: 
  - Pair (1, 2): Initial value 25, increased by 4, so total value is \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).
  - Pair (3, 2): Initial value 24, increased by 4, so total value is \( 24 + 4 = 28 \).
  - Total sum: \( 29 + 28 = 57 \).
  - Since the result needs to be in the form \( \frac{p}{q} \) and \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \), the output is \( 57 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 57 \).

Given the analysis and verification, the provided code seems to be correct.

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: True**
