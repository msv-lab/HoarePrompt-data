You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    return result % MOD

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a group of children, their friendships, and the number of excursions. For each test case, it calls the `func_1` function with the relevant parameters (number of children, number of friendships, number of excursions, and the list of friendships). After processing each test case, it prints the result returned by `func_1`. The function ultimately outputs the results of `func_1` for all test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for \( k \) excursions.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The initial friendship values are given, and we need to compute the expected sum of these values after \( k \) excursions.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function takes \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and a list of friendships as input.
   - It iterates through each friendship and calculates the contribution to the result.
   - The formula used is \( f \times \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) \).
     - Here, \( f \) is the initial friendship value.
     - \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) represents the number of times the friendship value will increase due to the random selection of the pair over \( k \) excursions.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), followed by the list of friendships.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each pair.
   - The formula \( f \times \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) \) is derived from the fact that each pair of friends has an equal probability of being chosen, and the friendship value increases linearly with each selection.
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and avoids overflow issues.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the constraints appropriately, including the maximum values for \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - The input format and processing are correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
