### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for \( k \) excursions.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The initial friendship values are given, and we need to compute the expected sum of these values after \( k \) excursions.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function takes \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and a list of friendships as input.
   - It iterates through each friendship and calculates the contribution to the result.
   - The formula used is \( f \times \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) \).
     - Here, \( f \) is the initial friendship value.
     - \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) represents the number of times the friendship value will increase due to the random selection of the pair over \( k \) excursions.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), followed by the list of friendships.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each pair.
   - The formula \( f \times \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) \) is derived from the fact that each pair of friends has an equal probability of being chosen, and the friendship value increases linearly with each selection.
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and avoids overflow issues.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the constraints appropriately, including the maximum values for \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - The input format and processing are correct according to the problem statement.

6. **Validation Using Function Summaries:**
   - The function summary confirms that `func_2` processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, which aligns with the problem description.
   - The output of `func_1` is correctly printed for each test case.

Given the analysis and the function summaries, the program appears to be correct. The logic in both functions is sound, and the implementation meets the requirements of the problem.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct.
