Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance of the problemset. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than `sqrt(x)` but less than `x // i`. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  10 4
  12 3
  20 5
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  3
  4
  ```

However, the program's output for these inputs would be incorrect because it does not properly distribute the problem difficulties to maximize the GCD. For example, in the case of `x = 10` and `n = 4`, the optimal distribution would be 2, 2, 2, 4, which gives a balance of 2, but the program might not consider this distribution.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it considers all possible ways to distribute the problem difficulties to maximize the GCD.
