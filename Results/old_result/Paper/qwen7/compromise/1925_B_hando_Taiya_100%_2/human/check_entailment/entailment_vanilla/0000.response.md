Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main logic. This function is never called within the loop where the actual processing happens. Therefore, this function is redundant and should be removed.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It then iterates over a range from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each `i` in this range, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
     - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `i`.
     - Similarly, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Divisibility Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if `x` is divisible by `i` using `x % i == 0`.

2. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The balance is calculated as the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems. The program uses `i` and `x // i` to find potential balances, which is correct because the GCD of `i` and `x // i` would be the same as the GCD of `i` and `x`.

3. **Optimization:**
   - The program only iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is an efficient approach to find the maximum balance.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when `n` is greater than `x` or when `x` is very large.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. The function `func_1()` is redundant and should be removed, but the main logic is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
