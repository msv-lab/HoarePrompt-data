The function reads multiple test cases, where each case consists of an integer `n` followed by a string `s`. It then evaluates the string `s` based on specific conditions related to the count of '1's in the string and the presence of '11'. Depending on these evaluations, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
