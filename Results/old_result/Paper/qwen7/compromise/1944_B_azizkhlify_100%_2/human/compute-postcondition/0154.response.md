Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n)`, which means `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Final State of `i`:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`.

4. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - We know that `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `i` is `0`.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and ends with `i = 2 * n - 1`, we need to ensure that the loop can execute correctly and reach the final value of `i`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should start at `0`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
