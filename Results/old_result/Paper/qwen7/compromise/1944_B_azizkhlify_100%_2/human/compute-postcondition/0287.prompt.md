Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`; `l[a[n-1] - 1]` will be incremented by 1.

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has processed each index from 0 to `n-1`. The list `l` will have been modified such that the element at the index `a[n-1] - 1` will have its value incremented by 1, reflecting the last iteration of the loop where `i` was set to `n-1`. All other variables (`res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) will retain their values from the final iteration of the loop, with no further changes.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list, `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list, `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list, `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
