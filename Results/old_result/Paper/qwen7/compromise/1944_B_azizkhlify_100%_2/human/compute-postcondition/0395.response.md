Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, `ur` is increased by 2, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or condition that was modifying `i`, `n`, `ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]`. The values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement, except that the loop or condition is exited.
