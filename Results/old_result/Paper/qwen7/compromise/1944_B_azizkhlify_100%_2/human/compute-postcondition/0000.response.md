Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This means that `int(input())` will read a value for `t`, and this value will determine how many times the loop will run.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will run `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range. The initial state of `t` being a positive integer between 1 and 5000 ensures that the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to maintain this condition.

4. **Final State**: The state before the loop starts should reflect that `t` is a valid input within the specified range.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)**.
