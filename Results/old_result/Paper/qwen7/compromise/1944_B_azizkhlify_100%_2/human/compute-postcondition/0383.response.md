Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, then the condition holds true; `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is `ur + 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, so its new value is `ur + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
