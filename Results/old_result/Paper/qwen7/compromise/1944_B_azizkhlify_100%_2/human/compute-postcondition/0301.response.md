Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `ul` is equal to `k * 2` if the condition `ul == k * 2` is true, otherwise the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, we need to update these variables.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, `n` should remain the same.
   - `ul` is only updated if the condition `ul == k * 2` is true, but since we are starting a new iteration, we assume `ul` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ul` remains unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `ul` is equal to `k * 2` if the condition `ul == k * 2` is true, otherwise the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ul` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is within the range `1` to `n-1`, `n` is at least 1, and `ul` is equal to `k * 2` if the condition `ul == k * 2` is true, otherwise the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged.**

To provide a specific example:
- If `i` was 0 before the iteration, it will be 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ul` remains unchanged.

So, a concrete state could be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, and `ul` is equal to `k * 2` if the condition `ul == k * 2` is true, otherwise the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged.**
