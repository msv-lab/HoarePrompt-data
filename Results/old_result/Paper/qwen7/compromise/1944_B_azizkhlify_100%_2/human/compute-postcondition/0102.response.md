Based on the initial state provided:

- `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.
- `x` is an integer (though the value of `x` is not relevant to the print statement).
- `a` is a list of integers.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The expression `a[i]` refers to an element in the list `a` at index `i`.
2. The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is given as 2. This means that `a[i] - 1` must be an index in the list `r` where the value is 2.
3. Since `a[i]` is an index in the list `a`, and we need to determine the value of `a[i]` to print it twice, we know that `a[i]` must be an integer that exists in the list `a`.

Given that `r[a[i] - 1] = 2`, it implies that `a[i] - 1` is an index in `r` where the value is 2. However, since the actual value of `a[i]` is not explicitly stated, we can only say that `a[i]` is an integer that satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
