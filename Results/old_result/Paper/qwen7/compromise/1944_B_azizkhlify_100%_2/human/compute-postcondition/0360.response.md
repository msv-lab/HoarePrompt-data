Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `res`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `res` contains at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `res` in the next iteration, but the state of `res` itself does not change based on the loop head alone.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - Since `res` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue, the state remains the same regarding `res`.
   - No other variables are mentioned or affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`res` must contain at least one element**
