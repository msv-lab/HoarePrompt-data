Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the seventh element from `res`.
- `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`.
- `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`.

We need to determine the values that will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Since `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume that `a` is the same as `res` for the purpose of this print statement. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the seventh element of `res`.

Let's denote the elements of `res` as follows:
- Let the fifth element of `res` be `res[4]`.
- Let the seventh element of `res` be `res[6]`.

Given the conditions:
- `n <= res[4]`
- `2 * n > res[4]`

From these conditions, we know that `n` must be an integer such that it satisfies both conditions. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified, but we only need to know that `a[i]` (which is `res[6]`) will be printed twice.

Thus, the output will be the seventh element of `res` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **res[6] res[6]**
