Output State: **`i` is `a[0]` and must be within the range [0, n-1]; `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l`. Since `i` is `a[0]`, the index being incremented is `a[a[0]] - 1`. The initial state of `i` and the range condition are preserved, while `l[a[i] - 1]` is updated by incrementing its current value by 1.
