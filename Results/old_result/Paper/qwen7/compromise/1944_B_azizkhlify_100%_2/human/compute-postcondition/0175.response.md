Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still satisfy the condition `n > 0`.

Given these points, we can conclude that `i` will be incremented to 2, and `n` must remain greater than 0.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**
