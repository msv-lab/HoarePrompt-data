Output State: **`i` is the seventh element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0; `ur` is `ur` plus 2.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. No other variables are affected, so the conditions and values of `i`, `n`, the relationship between `n` and the elements of `res`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged.
