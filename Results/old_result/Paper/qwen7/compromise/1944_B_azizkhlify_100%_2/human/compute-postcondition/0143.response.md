Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `a[0] + 1` and must be within the range [0, n-1].
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` using `range(n)`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition for the next iteration is `i < n`.
   - We need to determine the new value of `i` and ensure it satisfies the condition `0 <= i < n`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - From the initial state, `i` is `a[0] + 1`.

5. **Range Constraint:**
   - `i` must be within the range [0, n-1].

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `a[0] + 2` (since `i` was `a[0] + 1` in the previous iteration).

7. **Verification:**
   - Check if `a[0] + 2` is within the range [0, n-1]:
     - If `a[0] + 2` is within the range, then the loop can continue.
     - If `a[0] + 2` is out of range, the loop will not execute.

8. **State Adjustment:**
   - Update `i` to `a[0] + 2`.
   - Ensure `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (this part remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `a[0] + 2` and must be within the range [0, n-1]; `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
