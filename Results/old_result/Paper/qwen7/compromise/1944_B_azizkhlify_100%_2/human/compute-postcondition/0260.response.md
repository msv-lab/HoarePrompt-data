Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is the seventh element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`; if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is `ur` plus 2. We break out of the loop or condition we were inside.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or condition that was checking the postconditions. The values of `i`, `n`, and the relationship between `2 * n` and the fifth element of `res` remain unchanged. The value of `ur` also remains unchanged unless it was modified within the loop or condition being broken.
