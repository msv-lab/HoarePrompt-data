Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `2 * n`: This means `i` is twice the value of `n`.
   - `re` is incremented by 1 to equal `k`: This implies that `re` was initially `k - 1` and then it was incremented by 1 to become `k`.
   - `ul` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to break when `ul` equals `k * 2`: This suggests that `ul` is set to `k * 2` initially.
   - `k` is non-zero: This means `k` is a positive integer.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

Given these details, let's determine what will be printed:

- The value of `i` is `2 * n`.
- Since `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`. However, we know that `a` must have at least one element at index `2 * n` for the code to execute without errors.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is `2 * n`.

Output: **a[2 * n]**
