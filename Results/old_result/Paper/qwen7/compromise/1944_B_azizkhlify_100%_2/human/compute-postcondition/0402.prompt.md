Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, there is an array a of length 2n containing each integer from 1 to n exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `a[0]`, `res` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, and `ur` is the total count of elements in `r` that correspond to indices `a[i] - 1` where `i` ranges from `n` to `2 * n - 1` and were set to 0. No further changes to `ur` occur once it equals `ul`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is the fifth element from `res`. If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop breaks, and `i` remains unchanged. If the condition `ul != ur` is met, `i` becomes the last element from `res`, `n` is less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` is greater than the fifth element from `res`. Additionally, `ur` is increased by 2 for each occurrence where `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `n` is less than `2 * n`, and for each index where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `ur` is increased by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks early.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
