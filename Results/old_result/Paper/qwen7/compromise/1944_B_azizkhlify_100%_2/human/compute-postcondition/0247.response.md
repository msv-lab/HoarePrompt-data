Output State: **`i` is the sixth element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`. `ur` is 0, `ul` equals `ur`.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Given the conditions about `i`, `n`, and `ur`, the only change is that `ur` is now 0. Since `ul` is defined to be equal to `ur`, `ul` also becomes 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
