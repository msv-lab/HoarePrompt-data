Postcondition: `ur` is increased by 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur if the condition is not met.
