Given the initial state:
- `i` is `2 * n - 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `n` must be greater than 0, let's assume `n = 1` (the smallest possible value for `n`).
2. Calculate `i`: 
   \[
   i = 2 * n - 1 = 2 * 1 - 1 = 1
   \]
3. The value of `a[i]` depends on the contents of the list `a`. Since no specific values for `a` are provided, we'll denote the element at index `1` as `a[1]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **a[1] a[1]**
