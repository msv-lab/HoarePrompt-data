Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `a[0]` and must be within the range [0, n-1].
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` was `a[0]` in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `a[0] + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now `a[0] + 1`) must still be within the range [0, n-1].

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be `a[0] + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be within the range [0, n-1]. Therefore, `a[0] + 1` must be within this range.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is `a[0] + 1` and must be within the range [0, n-1].
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, but since we are only adjusting the loop head state, we don't need to change this part yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `a[0] + 1` and must be within the range [0, n-1]**.
