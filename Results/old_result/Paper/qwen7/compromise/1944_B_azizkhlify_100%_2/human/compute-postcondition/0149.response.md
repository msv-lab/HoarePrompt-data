Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Since `i` is initially `n + 1`, the value of `a[i]` is `a[n + 1]`. However, the exact value of `a[n + 1]` is not given, so we cannot specify the exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]`. But we know that `r[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1. The conditions and values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
