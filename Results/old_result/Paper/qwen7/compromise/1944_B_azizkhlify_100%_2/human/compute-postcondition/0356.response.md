Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` remains unchanged, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `re` is equal to `k` plus the number of elements added to `res`, `res` contains `a[3]`, `a[4]`, and any subsequent `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` until the condition `re == k` is met, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
