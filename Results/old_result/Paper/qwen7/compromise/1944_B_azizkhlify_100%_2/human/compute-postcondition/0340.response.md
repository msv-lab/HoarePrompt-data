Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 0; `ul` remains unchanged; `k` is `2 * k - ul`; `re` is equal to `k + 1`; `res` contains `a[3]`, and `a[i]` is appended to `res`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 4, `a[i]` refers to `a[4]`. The other variables (`n`, `ul`, `k`, `re`) remain unchanged from their initial or calculated states.
