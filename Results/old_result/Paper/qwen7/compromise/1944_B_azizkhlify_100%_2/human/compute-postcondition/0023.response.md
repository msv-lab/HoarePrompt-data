Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head consists of the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - According to the given state before the loop, `i` is `2 * n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`, incrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is set correctly based on the value of `n`, and `n` itself must be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `2 * n - 1`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
