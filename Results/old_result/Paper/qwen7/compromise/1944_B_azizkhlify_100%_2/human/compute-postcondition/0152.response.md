Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`. The variable `n` must be greater than 0. For each index `j` from `a[n] - 1` to `a[2 * n - 1] - 1`, the value of `r[j]` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `j + 1` in the sequence `a` from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`.

This means that `r[k]` (where `k` ranges from `a[n] - 1` to `a[2 * n - 1] - 1`) will contain the count of how many times `k + 1` appears in the subsequence of `a` starting from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`.
