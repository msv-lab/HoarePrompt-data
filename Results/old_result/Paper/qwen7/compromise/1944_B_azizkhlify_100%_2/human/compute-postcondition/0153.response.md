Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`. The variable `n` must be greater than 0. For each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1.

This means that after the loop completes, the value of `i` will be `2 * n - 1`, confirming it has iterated through all values from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. The array `r` will have been updated such that for each index `j` (where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`), `r[j]` will hold the count of how many times `a[i]` was equal to `j+1` for `i` in the range `[n, 2*n-1]`.
