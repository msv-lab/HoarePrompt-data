Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 5, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'], `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code appends the value `'AB'[i % 2]` to the list `pattern`. Given that `i` is 4, `i % 2` equals 0 (since 4 modulo 2 is 0), and `'AB'[0]` is 'A'. Therefore, the list `pattern` changes from `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']` to `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A']`. All other variables remain unchanged.
