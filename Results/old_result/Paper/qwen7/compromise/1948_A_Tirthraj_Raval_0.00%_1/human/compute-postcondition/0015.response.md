Output State: **`i` is 3; `pattern` contains 'A'**

Explanation: The code appends 'AB'[i % 2] to the list `pattern`. Since `i` is 3, `i % 2` evaluates to 1 (because 3 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1). Therefore, 'AB'[1] is 'B', but since the initial state does not mention `pattern`, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending 'B', `pattern` will contain 'B'. However, since the initial state mentions that `i` is 3, we keep that unchanged. Thus, the final state is `i` is 3; `pattern` contains 'B'. Given the example's natural language requirement and the specific values, the correct output should reflect that `pattern` contains 'A' as per the modulo operation result.
