Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `pattern` is a list of 9 alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, `i` is 4. If `n` is odd, `i` remains 4. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `n // 2 + 4`, `pattern` is a list containing 'A' and 'B' repeated `n // 2` times, and `n` must be greater than 12.
