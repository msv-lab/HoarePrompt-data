Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, it means `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `t`. It must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
