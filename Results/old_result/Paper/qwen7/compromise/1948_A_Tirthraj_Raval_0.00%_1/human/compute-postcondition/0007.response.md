Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `pattern` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `pattern`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `n` is still an input integer and even, and `pattern` is now an empty list.
