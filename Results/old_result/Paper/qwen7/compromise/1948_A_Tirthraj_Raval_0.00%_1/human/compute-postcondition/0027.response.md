Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, pattern is ['A'], `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code appends 'A' (since `i % 2` equals 0) to the `pattern` list. Initially, `i` is 0, so `i % 2` is 0, which corresponds to the first element of the list `['A', 'B']`. After appending, `pattern` becomes `['A']`. Also, since `i` was 0 and we incremented it by 1 modulo operation, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
