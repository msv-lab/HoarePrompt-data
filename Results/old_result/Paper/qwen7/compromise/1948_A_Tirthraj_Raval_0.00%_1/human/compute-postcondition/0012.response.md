Output State: **`i` is 2; `pattern` has an element 'B' appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is 2, so `i % 2` equals 0. The expression `'AB'[0]` evaluates to 'A'. However, since the initial state does not mention `pattern`, we assume it is a list or similar structure that gets modified. Thus, 'A' is appended to `pattern`. Since `i` does not change and `n` is not affected, the only change is the appending of 'A' to `pattern`.
