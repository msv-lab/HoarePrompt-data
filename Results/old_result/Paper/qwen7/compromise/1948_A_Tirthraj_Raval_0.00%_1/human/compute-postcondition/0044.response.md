Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 4.
   - `n` is an input integer and `t` is greater than 1 (though `t` is not directly involved in the loop).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n // 2` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 4, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
