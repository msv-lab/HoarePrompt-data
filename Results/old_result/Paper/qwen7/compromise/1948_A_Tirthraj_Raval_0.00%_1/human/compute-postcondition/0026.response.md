State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, pattern is an empty list, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n // 2)` requires `n // 2` to be at least 1, meaning `n` itself must be at least 1.
3. The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range(n // 2)` function.
4. The variable `pattern` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, but it should be noted as part of the initial state.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are to ensure `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts at 0.
