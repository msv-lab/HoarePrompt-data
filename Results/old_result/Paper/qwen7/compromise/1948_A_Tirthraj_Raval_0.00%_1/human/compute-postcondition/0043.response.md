Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `pattern` is an empty list, `i` is 4**

The code `pattern = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `pattern`. This overwrites the previous list of 9 alternating 'A' and 'B' characters. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
