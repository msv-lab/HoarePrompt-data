Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO', which is correct because an odd number of special characters cannot be formed as per the problem statement.
3. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and constructs a pattern of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters. This pattern ensures that every character except the first and last one has exactly one neighbor different from itself, making all but the first and last characters special.
4. The constructed pattern has a length of `n // 2`, which is sufficient to ensure that the total number of special characters is `n`. Since the pattern alternates, all characters except the first and last will be special, and the first and last characters will not be special unless `n` is 2, in which case the pattern "AB" satisfies the condition.
5. The function ensures that the output string length does not exceed 200, which is within the constraints of the problem.

Given these points, the provided code meets all the requirements of the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
