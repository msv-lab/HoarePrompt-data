Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the strings x and y represent the same integer when their digits are reversed.**

This means the function does not take any input parameters but checks if two given strings, `x` and `y`, which represent integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9, are reverses of each other. If they are, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
