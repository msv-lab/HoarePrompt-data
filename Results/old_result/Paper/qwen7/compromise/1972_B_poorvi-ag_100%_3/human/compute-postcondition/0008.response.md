Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it returns either "Up" if the number of "U" in `s` is greater than the number of "D", "Down" if the number of "D" in `s` is greater than the number of "U", or "Equal" if the number of "U" and "D" are equal.**

Note: The actual implementation details and logic to count "U" and "D" are not described here as per the instruction.
