Output State: **`eta` contains `j`, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and each element in the list `q` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`. If `q[n]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains `n`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is equal to `n`) to the list `eta`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
