Output State: `j` is greater than `eta_ln`, `eta_ln` must be greater than `j`, `res` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each iteration from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` for each iteration from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `j` will be greater than `eta_ln` because the loop breaks when `j` exceeds 1000, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. The variable `res` will be the sum of the expressions `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for every element in `eta` from index 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. Similarly, `rho` will accumulate the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for every element in `eta` from index 0 to `eta_ln - 1`.
