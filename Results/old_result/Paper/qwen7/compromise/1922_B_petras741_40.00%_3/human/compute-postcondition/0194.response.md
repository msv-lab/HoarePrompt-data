Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` remains the same (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `n` is an integer input by the user, and it is specified that `n` is less than 3.
- `w` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.

The print statement is simply `print(0)`, which will print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
