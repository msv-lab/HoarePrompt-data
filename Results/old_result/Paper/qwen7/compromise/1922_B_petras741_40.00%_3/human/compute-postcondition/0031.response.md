Output State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta_ln` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the list `eta`, which remains empty after the loop. Since `j` increments to `n + 1` after the loop, its value is `n + 1`. The variable `eta_ln` is assigned the length of `eta`, which is 0 because `eta` is an empty list.
