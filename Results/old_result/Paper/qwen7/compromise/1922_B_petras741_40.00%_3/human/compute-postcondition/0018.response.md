Output State: **`eta` is now [j], `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 1, and the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Initially, `eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n-1`, and `n` must be at least 1. After executing the code, `eta` will contain the value of `j`, which is `n-1`. All other conditions remain the same.
