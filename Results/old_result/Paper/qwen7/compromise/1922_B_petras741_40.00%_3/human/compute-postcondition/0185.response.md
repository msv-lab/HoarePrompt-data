Output State: **`j` is greater than 1002, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`**

Explanation: The value of `rho` is increased by the expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. Similarly, the value of `res` is also increased by the same expression. The conditions for `j` and `eta_ln` remain unchanged.
