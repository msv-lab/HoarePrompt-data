Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `n`**:
   - The variable `j` is initialized to 0 within the loop itself (i.e., `for j in range(n):`), so its initial value is not specified in the loop head but will be set to 0 at the start of each iteration.
   - The variable `n` is already given as an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate values from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 0 at the start of each iteration, we don't need to adjust its initial state.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0**
