Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is the loop variable that will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j < n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains the same (not relevant for the loop).
- `i` is `i + 1` (not relevant for the loop).
- `n` is an integer input by the user.
- `w` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces (not relevant for the loop).
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` elements, each element being 0 (not relevant for the loop).

The only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `j` and `n`.

Since `j` starts from 0 and the loop will continue as long as `j < n`, the initial value of `j` should be 0, and `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
