Output State: **`j` is greater than 1002, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001, `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. The values of `j` and `eta_ln` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
