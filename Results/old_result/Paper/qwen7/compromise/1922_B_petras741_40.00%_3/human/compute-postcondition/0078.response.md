Output State: `t` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0 except for the element at index `w[j]` which is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `q` will have been updated such that each element at index corresponding to any integer present in the list `w` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that integer in `w`. The indices in `q` range from 0 to `n`, where `n` is one more than the maximum integer found in `w`. All other variables outside the loop, including `t`, `i`, and `w`, will retain their initial or previously determined states.
