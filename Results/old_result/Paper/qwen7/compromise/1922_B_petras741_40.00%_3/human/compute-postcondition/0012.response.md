Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1 and its new value is 2.
   - `q[w[j]]` is also incremented by 1 and its new value is 2.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `j` will be `2` in the next iteration.
   - We need to check if the loop should continue based on the condition `j < n`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `j` will be `2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < n`. Since `j` is now `2`, the loop will continue as long as `2 < n`.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 2**.
