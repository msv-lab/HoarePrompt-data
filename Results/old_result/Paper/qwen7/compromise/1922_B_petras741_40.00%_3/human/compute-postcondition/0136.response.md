Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of `n + 1` elements, each element being 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a dictionary `q` with a list comprehension that creates a list of `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `w`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
