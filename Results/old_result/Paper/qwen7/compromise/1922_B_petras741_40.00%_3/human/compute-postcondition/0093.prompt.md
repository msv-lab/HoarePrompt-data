Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to integers present in `w` which are incremented by 1 for every occurrence of those integers in `w`, and `eta` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n + 1):
    if q[j] > 0:
        eta.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `q[j]` remains unchanged and `eta` contains the value `j`. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, then all variables retain their values from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration and the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, the condition holds as is. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, the condition still holds with `j` incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration and the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and if `q[j] > 0`, `eta` has the new value of `j` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
