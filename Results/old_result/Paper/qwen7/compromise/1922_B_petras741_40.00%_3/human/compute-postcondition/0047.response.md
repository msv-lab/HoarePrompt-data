Output State: **`res` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] * (q[eta[1001]] - 1) * (q[eta[1001]] - 2) // 6` to its current value, `rho` is updated based on the new value of `j`, `eta` must have at least one element, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, and `j` is now 1001; `res` is further updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] * (q[eta[1001]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its current value.**

This means that `res` has been updated twice. Initially, it was updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] * (q[eta[1001]] - 1) * (q[eta[1001]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. Now, it is further updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] * (q[eta[1001]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its current value. The other variables (`rho`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
