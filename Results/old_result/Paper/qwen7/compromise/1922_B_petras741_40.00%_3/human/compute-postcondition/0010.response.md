Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `j` is 0
  - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for j in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `j` is currently 0.
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, which means `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `1` in the next iteration.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - `j` will be updated to `1`.
   - Since `j` was 0 and `q[w[j]]` was incremented by 1, `q[w[0]]` is already incremented.
   - In the next iteration, `q[w[1]]` will be incremented by 1.

### Conclusion:
The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`j` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1**
