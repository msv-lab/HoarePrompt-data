Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0 except for the element at index `w[j]` which is incremented by 1, `j` is `j_end + 2` and the value of `q[w[j]]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Since `j` is `j_end + 2`, the specific index `w[j]` in the list `q` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
