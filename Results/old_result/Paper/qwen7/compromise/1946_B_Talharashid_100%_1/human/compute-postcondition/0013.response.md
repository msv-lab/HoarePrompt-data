Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int that must have at least one element, `c` is the sum of `ele` and `c` if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, otherwise `c` remains 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.
