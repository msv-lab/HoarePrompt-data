Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c + ele` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum between the new value of `c` (which is `c + ele`) and the current value of `maxi`. The value of `ele` remains the next element in the list `l`, and the list `l` and its length remain unchanged.
