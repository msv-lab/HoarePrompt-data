Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The line of code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current value of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. This means that `maxi` will hold the highest value encountered between `c` and its previous value. The initial state of all elements in the list `l` having been processed and `maxi` holding the highest value of `c` remains valid, just with `maxi` potentially updated to reflect the new maximum value.
