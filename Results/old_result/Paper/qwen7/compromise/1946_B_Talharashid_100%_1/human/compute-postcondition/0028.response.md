Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is an empty list (since all elements have been processed), `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` after processing all elements in `l` according to the given conditions, `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and the final value of `c`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set. The variables `n` and `k` also remain unchanged as they were part of the initial input and not modified within the loop. The list `l` becomes empty because all elements have been processed. The variable `c` holds the final cumulative value based on the conditions specified in the loop, and `maxi` retains the highest value encountered during the entire process of iterating through the list `l`.
