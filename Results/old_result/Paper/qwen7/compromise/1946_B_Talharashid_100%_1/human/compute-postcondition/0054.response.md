Postcondition: `l` is a list with at least one element, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and `abs(ele)`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to `abs(ele)`, then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous `maxi`.
