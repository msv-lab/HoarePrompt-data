Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `ele`, which is used to iterate over the elements of the list `l`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `l`.
   - The variable `ele` will take the value of each element in the list `l` one by one.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `maxi` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the list `l`, the list `l` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `ele` will take the value of each element in the list `l` during each iteration.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `l` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int that must have at least one element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0**
