Output State: **`c` is the sum of its previous value and `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum between the current value of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. The value of `c` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is the sum of its previous value and `ele`. The value of `ele` remains unchanged.
