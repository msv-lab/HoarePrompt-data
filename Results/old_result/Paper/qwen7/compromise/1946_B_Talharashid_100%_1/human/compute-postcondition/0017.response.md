Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int (with the first element removed)**.

Explanation: The code initializes `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, or `maxi`. The value of `c` remains 0, and `maxi` is set to the maximum of `c` (which is 0) and 0, which is still 0. Therefore, the only change is that `c` is explicitly set to 0, and `maxi` is also 0. The other variables retain their initial states.
