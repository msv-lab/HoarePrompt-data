Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` must have at least one element.
   - If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is 0, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `ele`.
   - Otherwise, `ele` is a non-negative number, `c` is updated to `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of the new `c` and the previous `maxi`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `l`, at the end of the previous iteration, `l` would have lost one element.
   - Therefore, `l` must now have at least one less element than before.

5. **Update the values**:
   - If `ele` was less than 0 and `c` was 0, then `maxi` would be `ele`.
   - If `ele` was non-negative, `c` would be updated to `c + ele`, and `maxi` would be the maximum of the new `c` and the previous `maxi`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `l` must have at least one less element than before.
- `c` is updated based on the previous value of `ele`.
- `maxi` is updated based on the previous value of `c` and `ele`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `ele`, `c`, and `maxi` from the previous iteration, we can only adjust the state of `l` and leave `c` and `maxi` as they are because their values depend on the specific `ele` that was processed in the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`l` must have at least one element**, `c` is the same as the previous iteration, `maxi` is the same as the previous iteration.
