Output State: **All elements in the list `l` have been processed, `maxi` holds the highest value of `c` (which starts at 0 and accumulates positive sums or resets to 0 when encountering negative elements whose absolute value does not exceed the current `c`).**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `maxi` will contain the highest sum of contiguous positive numbers in the list `l`, considering that the sum resets to 0 whenever a negative number is encountered whose absolute value is less than or equal to the current accumulated sum `c`.
