Output State: **`l` must have at least one element, `ele` is a non-negative number, `c` is now `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `maxi` before the operation.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum value between the current `c` (which is `c + ele`) and the previous value of `maxi`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
