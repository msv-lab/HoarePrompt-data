Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one element (excluding the current `ele`), `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and abs(`ele`).**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. The value of `maxi` remains the maximum between its previous value and the absolute value of `ele`, which is already defined in the initial state. The list `l` and the variable `ele` remain unchanged.
