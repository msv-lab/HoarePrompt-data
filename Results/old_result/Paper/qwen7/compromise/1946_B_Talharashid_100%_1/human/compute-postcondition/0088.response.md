Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements (one less than before), `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and the previous `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`. The list `l` loses one element (`ele`), and `ele` itself remains unchanged as it is only referenced but not modified. The value of `maxi` is now the maximum of its previous value and `c`.
