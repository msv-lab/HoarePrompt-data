Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and converts them to integers. These integers are assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
