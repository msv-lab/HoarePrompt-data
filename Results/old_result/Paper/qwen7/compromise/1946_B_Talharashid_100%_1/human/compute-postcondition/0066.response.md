Output State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`, `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the value of the first integer input, and `k` is the value of the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. The values of `maxi`, `i`, and the initial input values remain unchanged from their previous states.
