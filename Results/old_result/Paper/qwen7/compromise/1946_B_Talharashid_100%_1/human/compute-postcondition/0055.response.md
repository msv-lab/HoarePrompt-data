Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `l` is a list with at least one element.
- `c` is increased by the value of `ele`.
- `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and `abs(ele)`.
- If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to `abs(ele)`, then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous `maxi`.

### Loop Head Variables
The loop head variables are `ele` (the current element from the list `l`).

### Conditions for the Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, the list `l` must still have at least one element. This means we need to remove the current element `ele` from the list `l`.

### Adjusting the States
- The list `l` will now have at least one element minus the current element `ele`.
- The variable `c` will be updated based on the value of the current element `ele`.
- The variable `maxi` will be updated based on the value of `c` and `abs(ele)`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. Remove the current element `ele` from the list `l`.
2. Update `c` by adding the value of `ele` to it.
3. Update `maxi` to be the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `abs(ele)`.

### Final State
Given that the list `l` had at least one element, after removing the current element `ele`, the list will still have at least one element. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element (excluding the current `ele`), `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and `abs(ele)`**.

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head and the list `l` is modified by removing the current element, we can simplify this to:

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element (excluding the current `ele`), `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and `abs(ele)`**.

To clearly represent the simplified state:

State: **`l` is a list with at least one element (excluding the current `ele`), `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and `abs(ele)`**.

This is the final state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
