Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is an empty list since all elements have been processed, `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and the value of `c` when `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is false, or 0 when it is true.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain as they were initially, `l` becomes an empty list because all elements have been processed, `c` holds the final sum based on the given conditions, and `maxi` keeps track of the highest value of `c` under the specified conditions during the loop's execution.
