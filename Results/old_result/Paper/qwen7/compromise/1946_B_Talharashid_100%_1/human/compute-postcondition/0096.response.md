Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

We need to determine the value of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` when the print statement is executed.

However, the initial state does not provide explicit values for `k`, `c`, `l`, or `sum(l)`. Therefore, we can only describe the components of the expression in terms of these variables.

- `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, so `maxi` is the larger value between `c` and the current value of `maxi`.
- `2 ** k` is a power of 2, where `k` is an integer.
- `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

Given this information, the expression inside the print statement can be described as follows:

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007**
