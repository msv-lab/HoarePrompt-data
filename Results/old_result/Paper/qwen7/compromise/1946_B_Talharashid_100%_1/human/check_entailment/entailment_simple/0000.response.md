Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem asks for the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the optimal strategy involves using the largest positive elements in the array and making them even larger through the operations. Negative elements should be avoided as much as possible since adding their sums will only decrease the total sum.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code iterates through the array to find the maximum prefix sum (`maxi`). This is done by maintaining a cumulative sum (`c`) and updating `maxi` whenever a new maximum is found.
   - After finding `maxi`, the code calculates the final result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

4. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `2 ** k * maxi`: This term represents the sum contributed by the maximum prefix sum being inserted `2 ** k` times.
   - `- maxi`: This term subtracts the overcounted part of the maximum prefix sum.
   - `+ sum(l)`: This term adds the original sum of the array.
   - `% 1000000007`: This ensures the result fits within the required modulo.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles negative numbers correctly by resetting the cumulative sum (`c`) when encountering a negative number smaller than the current cumulative sum (`c`).

6. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo `1000000007` ensures that the result remains within a manageable range and avoids overflow issues.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

Correctness: **True**
