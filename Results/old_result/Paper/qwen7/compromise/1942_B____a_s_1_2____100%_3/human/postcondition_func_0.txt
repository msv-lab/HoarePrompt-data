The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a permutation p of length n such that for each index i, p[i] = mex - a[i], where mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the modified list. The function prints the permutation p for each test case.
