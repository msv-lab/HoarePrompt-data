Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `-1`. For each `i` from `n-1` down to `0`, `p[i]` will be set to `mex - a[i]`, and `mex` will be updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`. The final value of `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `p`.

This means that `p` will contain values based on the initial `mex` value adjusted by the elements of `a`, and `mex` will reflect the smallest missing non-negative integer in the resulting list `p`.
