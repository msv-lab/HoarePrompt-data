Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `mex` will be the minimum value found among all elements in the list `p`. Each element `p[i]` (for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`) will be equal to `mex - a[i]`.

This means that after the loop completes, `mex` will hold the smallest value that does not appear in the list `p` (which is updated in each iteration), and every element in `p` will reflect the difference between `mex` and the corresponding element in `a`.
