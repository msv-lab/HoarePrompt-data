Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[n-2]`, which is `mex - a[n-2]`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`, where `i` is updated to `n-3` (decremented by 1 from `n-2`). The value of `mex` remains as the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[n-2]`, which is `mex - a[n-2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
