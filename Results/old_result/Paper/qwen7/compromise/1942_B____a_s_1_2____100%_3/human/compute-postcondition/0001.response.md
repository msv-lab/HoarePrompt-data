State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it should iterate.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The variables `_` and the loop body are not relevant to adjusting the initial state since they do not affect the loop's execution condition.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.
