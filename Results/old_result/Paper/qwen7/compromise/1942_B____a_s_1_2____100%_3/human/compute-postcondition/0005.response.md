Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, `mex` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. Since `n` is an input integer, `mex` is also an input integer and is equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
