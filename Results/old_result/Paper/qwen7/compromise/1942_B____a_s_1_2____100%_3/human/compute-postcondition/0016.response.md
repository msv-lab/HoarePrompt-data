Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `-1`; `mex` is the minimum value found during the loop execution among `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`; `p[i]` is updated for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` to be `mex - a[i]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have become `-1` (since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0`), `mex` will hold the minimum value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, and `p[i]` will contain the value `mex - a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
