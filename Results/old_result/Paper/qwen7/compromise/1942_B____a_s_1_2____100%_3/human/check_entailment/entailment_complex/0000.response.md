Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The provided solution iterates backward through the array \( a \), setting \( p[i] = \texttt{MEX} - a[i] \). Here, \(\texttt{MEX}\) is initialized to \( n \) and updated to the minimum value between the current \(\texttt{MEX}\) and the calculated \( p[i] \).
3. This approach ensures that each \( p[i] \) is set to a value that maintains the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
4. The logic correctly updates \(\texttt{MEX}\) to reflect the minimum value that can still be used as \(\texttt{MEX}\) for the next iteration.
5. The final permutation \( p \) is constructed and printed for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
