Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic for calculating the MEX value and assigning values to the permutation \( p \) is flawed.

Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected output:
A valid permutation \( p \) such as `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` where:
- \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 \)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 \)
- \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 \)

However, the provided program generates a permutation \( p \) such as `[3, 2, 0, 1, 4]` which does not satisfy the conditions. For example, for \( i = 3 \):
- \( p = [3, 2, 0, 1, 4] \)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(3, 2, 0, 1) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \), but the actual \( a_4 \) should be 1.

This indicates that the program does not correctly compute the MEX value and assign the correct values to the permutation \( p \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
