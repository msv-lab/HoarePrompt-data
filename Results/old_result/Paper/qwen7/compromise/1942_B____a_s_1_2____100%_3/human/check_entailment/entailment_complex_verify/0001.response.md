### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A list `p` of size `n` is initialized with `-1` values.
   - A variable `mex` is set to `n`, which will be used to find the MEX value.

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the permutation `p`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Correct Calculation of MEX:**
   - The goal is to ensure that `p[i] = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.
   - However, the current implementation does not correctly compute the MEX for the suffix starting from `i` to the end. Instead, it uses a backward iteration to assign values to `p[i]` based on the current `mex` value.

2. **Updating MEX:**
   - The `mex` value is updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest unused index in the permutation, but it does not guarantee that the MEX value is correctly assigned for the suffix starting from `i`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the MEX value might be incorrectly assigned due to the backward iteration. For example, consider the input:
     ```
     1
     3
     -2 1 2
     ```
   - The expected output should be `[2, 0, 1]` because:
     - \(\texttt{MEX}([2]) - 2 = 0\)
     - \(\texttt{MEX}([2, 0]) - 0 = 1\)
     - \(\texttt{MEX}([2, 0, 1]) - 1 = 2\)
   - However, the current implementation would produce `[0, 1, 2]` because it uses a backward iteration, which might not correctly propagate the MEX value.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to generate a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The backward iteration approach does not ensure that the MEX value is correctly assigned for the suffix starting from `i`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the suffix starting from `i` to the end.
