Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to generate a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. However, the logic used to calculate `p[i]` might not always produce a valid permutation that satisfies the condition \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\).

The program initializes `p` with `-1` for all indices and then iterates backward through the array `a`, setting `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`. This approach has several issues:

1. **Backward Iteration**: The backward iteration does not ensure that the values assigned to `p` are consistent with the forward definition of `MEX`.
2. **Initialization of `mex`**: Setting `mex` to `n` initially might not correctly reflect the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the permutation `p` is built in a way that respects the definition of `MEX` for each prefix. One correct approach would be to iterate through the array `a` and use a set to keep track of the elements already placed in `p`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
        
        print(*p)
```

This version ensures that each element added to `p` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used, which correctly reflects the definition of `MEX`.

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
