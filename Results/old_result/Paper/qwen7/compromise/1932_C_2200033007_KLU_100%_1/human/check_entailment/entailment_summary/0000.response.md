Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` processes the array `a` according to the commands in `s` and calculates the required remainders.
3. The program iterates over the commands in `s`, appending elements to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
4. After constructing `b`, it calculates the product of its elements in reverse order, taking the modulo `m` at each step, and stores these results in `ans`.
5. The final results are returned in reverse order, which matches the expected output format.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to be correct and follows the specified logic accurately.

Correctness: **True**
