### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - We need to process each command in the string `s` and output the remainder of the product of the current array elements when divided by `m`.
   - After each command, we remove the leftmost or rightmost element from the array based on the command ('L' or 'R').

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by iterating through `a` and appending elements from the start or end of `a` based on the characters in `s`.
   - It then calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m` at each step, and stores these intermediate results in a list `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list of these intermediate results.

3. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input and calls `func_1` to process the commands.
   - In `func_1`, the loop constructs the list `b` by appending elements from the start or end of `a` based on the commands.
   - However, the product calculation and modulo operation are performed on the elements of `b` in reverse order, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program should calculate the product of the current array elements before taking the modulo operation, but it incorrectly appends elements to `b` without performing the required product calculation.
   - The function summary describes the process of constructing `b` and then calculating the product in reverse order, which does not match the problem statement's requirement to output the remainder of the product of the current array elements at each step.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function summary also does not accurately reflect the intended behavior of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the product of the array elements before taking the modulo operation at each step.
