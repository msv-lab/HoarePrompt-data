Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remainder:**
   - The program calculates the product of the array elements and takes the remainder modulo `m` after each command but does not update the product correctly.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle the removal of elements based on the command ('L' or 'R') but does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements and their remainders.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Command Execution:**
   - The program attempts to append elements to the list `b` based on the command ('L' or 'R'), which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to print the remainder of the product of the current state of the array before removing an element.
   - Instead of appending elements to `b`, the program should directly compute the product of the current array elements and then take the remainder modulo `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    prod = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Compute the product of the current state of the array
        for j in range(i):
            prod = (prod * a[j]) % m
        # Append the remainder of the product
        ans.append(prod)
        # Process the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return ans
```

This corrected version ensures that the product of the current state of the array is computed and its remainder modulo `m` is appended to the result list `ans` before processing the next command.
