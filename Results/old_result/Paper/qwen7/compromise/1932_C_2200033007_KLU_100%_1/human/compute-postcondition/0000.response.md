Output State: **`b` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.**

The code initializes an empty list `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
