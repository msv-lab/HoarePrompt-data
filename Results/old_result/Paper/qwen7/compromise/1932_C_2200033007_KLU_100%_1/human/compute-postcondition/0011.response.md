Output State: **The program returns a reversed list of all intermediate results of `p` from each iteration of the loop.**

This means that the program returns a list where the elements are the intermediate results of `p` (the product of all elements in the list `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`) from each iteration of the loop, but in reverse order themselves.
