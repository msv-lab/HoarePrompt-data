You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second line is a string s of length n consisting of '0's and '1's representing the initial state of the boxes; the third line is a string f of length n consisting of '0's and '1's representing the desired state of the boxes.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has processed all test cases provided. For each test case, `cnt` reflects the total number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ. If `s1` (the number of '1's in `s`) equals `t1` (the number of '1's in `t`), the output is `s1` if `cnt` is zero, otherwise, it is `0`. If `s1` does not equal `t1`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, and the output is `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`. The variables `i`, `n`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, and `d` are no longer changing within the loop context but retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \), and another binary string \( f \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state \( s \) into the desired state \( f \). If the number of '1's in \( s \) equals the number of '1's in \( f \), it outputs the number of differing positions if they are zero, otherwise, it outputs zero. If the number of '1's in \( s \) does not equal the number of '1's in \( f \), it computes the absolute difference and adjusts the count of differing positions accordingly before outputting the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. Specifically, the program fails to account for the different types of operations (adding, removing, and moving cats) separately and does not handle the logic for these operations properly.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0101
1010
3
100
101
4
0101
1010
```

- For the first test case (`0101` to `1010`), the program incorrectly outputs `2`, but the correct answer is `3`. The correct operations are: move the cat from the first box to the second, move the cat from the third box to the fourth, and finally move the cat from the second box to the third.
- For the second test case (`100` to `101`), the program incorrectly outputs `3`, but the correct answer is `1`. The correct operation is to move the cat from the third box to the fourth.
- For the third test case (`0101` to `1010`), the program incorrectly outputs `2`, but the correct answer is `3`. The correct operations are: move the cat from the first box to the second, move the cat from the third box to the fourth, and finally move the cat from the second box to the third.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly handle the different types of operations and thus does not provide the correct minimum number of operations for all cases.
