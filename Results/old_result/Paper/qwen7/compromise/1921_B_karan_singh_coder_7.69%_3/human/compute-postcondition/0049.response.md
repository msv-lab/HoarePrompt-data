Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is the last index that was checked, which is `n-1`.
   - `n` is reduced to the number of iterations performed, which is `i+1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means we need to set `i` to a value that is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially `n-1`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to start.
   - `n` should be set to `i + 1` because the loop will start with `i` being `n-1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `n` must be set to `i + 1`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` is `i + 1`**.
