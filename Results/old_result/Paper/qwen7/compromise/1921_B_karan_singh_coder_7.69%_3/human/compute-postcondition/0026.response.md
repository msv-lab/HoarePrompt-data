Output State: **`cnt` will be the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is a string input by the user; `n` is an input integer converted to an integer; `s1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `s` is updated to the string input by the user; `i` is `n-1`; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `t1 = t.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `t` and assigns this count to the variable `t1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
