Output State: **The input value from `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `cnt` holds the count of mismatches between strings `s` and `t`, `i` is the last index that was checked (which is `n-1`), `n` is reduced to the number of iterations performed (which is `i+1`), the strings `s` and `t` remain the same as they were after the last iteration, and now `t` is updated to the new input string.**

In this step, the code reads a new input string and assigns it to the variable `t`. All other variables retain their previous states, including the condition that the input value from `int(input())` must be greater than 0, the count of mismatches `cnt`, the last index checked `i`, the number of iterations `n`, and the strings `s` and `t` remain unchanged except that `t` is now updated to the new input string.
