Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will iterate based on the integer value entered by the user.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt`: Total count of positions where characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`.
   - `t1`: Number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.
   - `t`: An input integer.
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `s`: A string input by the user.
   - `i`: `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as the user inputs an integer. The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the state directly.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by user input, the only thing that changes is the input itself.
   - After each iteration, the user will provide a new integer, which will be used to initialize the loop again.

5. **State adjustment**:
   - `cnt`: Remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting `cnt` are specified.
   - `t1`: Remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting `t1` are specified.
   - `t`: Remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting `t` are specified.
   - `n`: Remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting `n` are specified.
   - `s`: Remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting `s` are specified.
   - `i`: Remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting `i` are specified.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0, but since it remains unchanged, this condition is preserved.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`cnt` will be the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 0**.
