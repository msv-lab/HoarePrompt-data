Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer n, a binary string s of length n, and a binary string f of length n. The function returns the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state represented by s into the desired state represented by f.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters (n, s, and f), and calculates the minimum number of operations needed to change the initial state (s) to the desired state (f) for each case.
