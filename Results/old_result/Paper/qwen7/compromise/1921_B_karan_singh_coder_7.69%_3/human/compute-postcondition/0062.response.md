Postcondition: **`cnt` is equal to the total number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, `i` is equal to `-1`, `n` is equal to the total number of iterations performed (which is the length of `s` or `t`, whichever is smaller), and either `s1` equals `t1` or `d` is equal to the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` at the current position.**
