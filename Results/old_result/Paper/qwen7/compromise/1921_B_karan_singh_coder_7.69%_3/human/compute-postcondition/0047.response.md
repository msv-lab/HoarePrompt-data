Output State: **The input value from `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `cnt` holds the count of mismatches between strings `s` and `t`, `i` is the last index that was checked (which is `n-1`), `n` is reduced to the number of iterations performed (which is `i+1`), the strings `s` and `t` remain the same as they were after the last iteration, `s1` is the count of '1's in string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in string `t`**.

`t1` is assigned the value of the count of '1's in string `t`. The states of the other variables are not affected.
