Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` checks if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different. If they are different, `cnt` is incremented by 1. If they are the same, `cnt` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` is also preserved.
