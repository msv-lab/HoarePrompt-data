Output State: **`cnt` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` by checking if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`. Since `i` is initially 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
