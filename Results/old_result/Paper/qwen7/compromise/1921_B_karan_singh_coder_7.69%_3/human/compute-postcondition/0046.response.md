Output State: **The input value from `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `cnt` holds the count of mismatches between strings `s` and `t`, `i` is the last index that was checked (which is `n-1`), `n` is reduced to the number of iterations performed (which is `i+1`), the strings `s` and `t` remain the same as they were after the last iteration, `s1` is the count of '1's in string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of '1's in the string `s` and assigns the result to the variable `s1`. The other variables (`cnt`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `t`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
