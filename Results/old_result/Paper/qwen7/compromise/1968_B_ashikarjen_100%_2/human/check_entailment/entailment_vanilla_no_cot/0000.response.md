Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is almost correct, but it has a small issue that causes it to fail in some edge cases. Specifically, the program increments `j` twice when it finds a matching character in the inner `while` loop, which can lead to skipping characters in string `b` prematurely. This might cause the program to miss potential subsequences.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1  # Only increment j once after finding a match
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return
```

In this corrected version, `j` is incremented only once after finding a match in the inner `while` loop, ensuring that the program correctly tracks the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
