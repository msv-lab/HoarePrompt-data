Output State: `j` is greater than or equal to `m` and `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `k` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Since the loop executes up to the point where `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`, the final value of `j` will be greater than or equal to `m`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's condition or body.
