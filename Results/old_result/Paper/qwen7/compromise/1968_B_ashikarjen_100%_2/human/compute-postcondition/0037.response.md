Output State: **`j` is greater than or equal to `m` + 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `k` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `m + 2`, and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is now greater than or equal to `m` + 1, while all other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
