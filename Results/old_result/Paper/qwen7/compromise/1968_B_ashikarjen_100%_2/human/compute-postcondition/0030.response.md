Output State: **`j` is greater than or equal to `m`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `k` is 1, `i` is `m + 1`**.

The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
