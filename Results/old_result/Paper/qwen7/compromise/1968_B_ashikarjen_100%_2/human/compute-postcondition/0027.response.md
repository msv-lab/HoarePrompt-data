Output State: `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `k` is 0, `i` is `m + 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. After executing the loop multiple times, `j` will eventually reach a value that is no longer less than `m` or it will find a match for `b[j] == a[i]`, causing the loop to terminate. Given the conditions provided, once `j` reaches or exceeds `m`, the loop condition `j < m` becomes false, and the loop stops. Therefore, the final state of `j` will be greater than or equal to `m`, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states within the loop.
