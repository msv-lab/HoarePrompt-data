Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` + 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `k` is 1, `i` is `m + 2`, and for all `p` where `m <= p < m`, `b[p]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` was equal to `m`. After executing the code, `j` is now equal to `m + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
