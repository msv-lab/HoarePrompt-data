Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0**.

The code initializes `k` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables while updating `k` to 0.
