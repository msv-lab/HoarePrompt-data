Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than 2, and `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**.

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
