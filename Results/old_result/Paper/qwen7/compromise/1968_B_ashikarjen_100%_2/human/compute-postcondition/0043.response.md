Output State: `j` is greater than or equal to `m + 3`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `k` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `m + 2`, and for all `p` where `m <= p < j`, `b[p]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be at least `m + 3`, and it will have incremented each time the condition `j < m and b[j] != a[i]` was true. Additionally, none of the characters from `b[m]` to `b[j-1]` should match `a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
