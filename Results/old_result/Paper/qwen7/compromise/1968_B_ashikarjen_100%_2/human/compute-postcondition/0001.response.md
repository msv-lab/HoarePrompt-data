Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a = input()` reads input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since `a` is assigned to `input()`, which returns a string, `n` is now a string. The initial values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged.
