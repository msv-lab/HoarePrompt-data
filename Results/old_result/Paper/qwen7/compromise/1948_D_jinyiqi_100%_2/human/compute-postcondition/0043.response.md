Output State: **`count` is 0, `k` is 0, `n` is greater than `j`, and the condition `(s[k] != '?' and s[k + j] != '?' and s[k] != s[k + j])` is true**

Explanation: The line `count = 0` sets the value of `count` to 0. However, since the initial value of `count` was also 0, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial states.
