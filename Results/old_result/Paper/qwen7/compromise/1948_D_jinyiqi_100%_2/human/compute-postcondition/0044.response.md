Postcondition: `count` is 1 if either the character at index `k` in string `s` is '?', or the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is '?', or the character at index `k` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`. Otherwise, `count` is 0, and `k` is 0, `n` is greater than `j`, and the condition `(s[k] != '?' and s[k + j] != '?' and s[k] != s[k + j])` is true.
