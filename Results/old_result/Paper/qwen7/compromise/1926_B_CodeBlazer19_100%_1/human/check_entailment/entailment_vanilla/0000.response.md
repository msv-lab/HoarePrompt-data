Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes two variables `a` and `b`. 
     - `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if any row contains exactly one '1'.
     - `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'.
   
3. **Checking Rows:**
   - The program iterates over each row of the grid.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
   
4. **Output:**
   - After processing all rows, the program prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is non-zero (indicating a triangle was found).
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling of Multiple Shapes:**
   - The problem statement guarantees that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square. However, the program does not handle cases where multiple shapes might be present.
   - For example, if there is both a triangle and a square in the grid, the program will only detect the last one processed (either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE'), leading to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Triangle Detection:**
   - The program sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE' if any row contains exactly one '1'. This logic is flawed because it does not check if the '1's form a valid triangle.
   - For instance, a row like "010" would incorrectly trigger the triangle detection, even though it does not form a triangle.

3. **Square Detection:**
   - The program sets `b` to 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'. This logic is also flawed because it does not ensure that the '1's form a valid square.
   - For example, a row like "0110" would incorrectly trigger the square detection, even though it does not form a square.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
