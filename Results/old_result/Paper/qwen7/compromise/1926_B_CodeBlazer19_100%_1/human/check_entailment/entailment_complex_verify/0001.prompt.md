You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0

    #State: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is `n + t - 1`, `n` is the sum of all individual `n` values input during each iteration, and `s` is the final input string from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each grid, it determines whether the '1's form a triangle or a square. If a single row contains exactly one '1', it concludes the shape is a triangle; otherwise, it concludes the shape is a square. The function prints 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes two variables `a` and `b`. 
     - `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if any row contains exactly one '1'.
     - `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'.
   
3. **Checking Rows:**
   - The program iterates over each row of the grid.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
   
4. **Output:**
   - After processing all rows, the program prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is non-zero (indicating a triangle was found).
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling of Multiple Shapes:**
   - The problem statement guarantees that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square. However, the program does not handle cases where multiple shapes might be present.
   - For example, if there is both a triangle and a square in the grid, the program will only detect the last one processed (either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE'), leading to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Triangle Detection:**
   - The program sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE' if any row contains exactly one '1'. This logic is flawed because it does not check if the '1's form a valid triangle.
   - For instance, a row like "010" would incorrectly trigger the triangle detection, even though it does not form a triangle.

3. **Square Detection:**
   - The program sets `b` to 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'. This logic is also flawed because it does not ensure that the '1's form a valid square.
   - For example, a row like "0110" would incorrectly trigger the square detection, even though it does not form a square.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
