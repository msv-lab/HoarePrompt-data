Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's an analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this logic is flawed because:
   - A triangle can have more than one row with a single '1' (e.g., a triangle with `k=3` would have rows "010", "011", "010").
   - Rows with more than one '1' do not necessarily form a square.

2. The program sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE' if any row has exactly one '1', but it never checks for the specific pattern required to form a triangle or a square.

3. The program sets `b` to 'SQUARE' if any row has more than one '1', but again, this is not sufficient to determine a square.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```
This grid contains a triangle, but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square.

Another example:
```
5
00111
00010
00000
00000
00000
```
This grid contains a triangle, but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square.

Since the program fails to correctly identify the shapes in these cases, the correctness is **False**.
