Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is the input string, and the count of '1' in `s` is either exactly 1 or greater than 1.**

The code `b = 'SQUARE'` updates the value of `b` to 'SQUARE'. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
