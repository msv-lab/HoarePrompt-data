Postcondition: `s` is a new string input by the user, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged, `b` is either 'SQUARE' or unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be the same as before. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` becomes 'TRIANGLE'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` becomes 'SQUARE'.
