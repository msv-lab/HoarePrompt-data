Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 0, the input string `s` from the user contains more than one '1'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'SQUARE'` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `j` is 0, and the input string `s` from the user contains more than one '1' remains valid. The only change is that `b` is now set to `'SQUARE'`.
