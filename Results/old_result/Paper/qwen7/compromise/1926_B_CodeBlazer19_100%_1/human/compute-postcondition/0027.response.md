Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is the input string, and `s` is updated to the new input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = 'SQUARE'` updates the value of `b` to 'SQUARE'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
