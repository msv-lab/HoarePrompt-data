Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each grid, it determines whether the '1's form a triangle or a square. If a single row contains exactly one '1', it concludes the shape is a triangle; otherwise, it concludes the shape is a square. The function prints 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each test case.**
