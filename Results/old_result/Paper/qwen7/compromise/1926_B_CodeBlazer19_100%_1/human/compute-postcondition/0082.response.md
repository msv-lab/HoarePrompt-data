Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 3, `s` is the final input string from the user, `n` is an integer input by the user.**

In this case, the code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
