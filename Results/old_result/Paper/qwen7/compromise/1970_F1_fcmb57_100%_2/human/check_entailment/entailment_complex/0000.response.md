Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the field dimensions and reads the initial state of the field, including players, goals, and the Quaffle.
2. The program correctly handles the movements of players and updates their positions.
3. The program checks if a player has scored a goal and updates the score accordingly.
4. The program prints the appropriate messages when a goal is scored and the final score at the end of the game.
5. The function `func_1` is defined and used correctly to update the position of the players based on the movement commands.

Given the annotated program and the provided examples, the program appears to follow the rules and logic specified in the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to handle the movement of players.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
