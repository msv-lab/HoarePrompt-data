Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the initial state of the field, including players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
2. **Movement Function**: The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of a player based on the movement direction.
3. **Action Handling**: The program handles different actions correctly:
   - For movements (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the player's position.
   - For catching the Quaffle (`C`), it should update the player's position and the Quaffle's position to the player's new position.
   - For throwing the Quaffle (`T`), it should update the Quaffle's position to the player's current position.
4. **Scoring Logic**: The program checks if a player has thrown the Quaffle into the opponent's goal and updates the score accordingly. It prints the appropriate message when a goal is scored.
5. **Final Score Output**: After processing all actions, the program correctly outputs the final score.

However, there are a few issues in the implementation:
- The `func_1` function is named `mouvements` in the global scope, which shadows the dictionary. This might cause confusion but does not affect functionality.
- The program does not handle the case where a player catches the Quaffle and then throws it. It only checks if the player is in the opponent's goal after a throw.
- The program does not handle the case where a player catches the Quaffle and then moves before throwing it.

Given these points, the program logic is mostly correct but lacks handling for some specific cases.

Correctness: **False**
