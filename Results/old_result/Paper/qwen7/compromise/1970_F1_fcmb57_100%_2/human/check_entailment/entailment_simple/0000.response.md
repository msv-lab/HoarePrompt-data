Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input and initializes the necessary data structures.
2. The `func_1` function correctly computes the new position of a player given a direction.
3. The program iterates through the list of moves and updates the positions of the players and checks for scoring conditions.
4. The scoring logic is correct: when a player with a Quaffle reaches a goal belonging to the opposing team, the corresponding team scores a point.
5. The program prints the correct events and the final score in the required format.

Given these points, the provided code appears to be correct according to the problem description and the annotated program.

Correctness: **True**
