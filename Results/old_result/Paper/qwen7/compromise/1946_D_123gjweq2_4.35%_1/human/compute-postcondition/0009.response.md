Postcondition: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of integers representing a segment of the array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, `x` is an integer representing the favorite number, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in `cur_arr` up to the point where the XOR result's `bit`-th bit is 1, and the current value of `xor` shifted right by `bit` bits and bitwise AND with 1 equals 1.**
