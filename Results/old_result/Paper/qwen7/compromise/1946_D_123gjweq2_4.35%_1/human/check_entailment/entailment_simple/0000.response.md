### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed a given number `x`. The solution uses a recursive approach to consider each bit position from the most significant to the least significant.

2. **Function `find_max` Analysis**:
   - The function `find_max` is designed to handle the recursive computation of the maximum number of segments.
   - It iterates through the current array segment (`cur_arr`) and computes the cumulative XOR (`xor`) at each step.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, it appends `xor` to `new_arr`.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1, it sets `thing1` to -1, indicating that no further segments can be formed with this prefix.
   - It recursively calls `find_max` on `new_arr` for the next bit position (`bit - 1`).
   - Finally, it checks the `bit`-th bit of `x` and returns the appropriate value.

3. **Base Case and Recursive Case**:
   - The base case (`bit == -1`) returns the length of the current segment (`len(cur_arr)`).
   - The recursive case handles the splitting of the array based on the current bit and the value of `x`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `find_max` with the initial parameters, starting from the most significant bit (31).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where no valid segments can be formed, returning -1.

6. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases like single-element arrays and arrays where the cumulative XOR exceeds `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program logic correctly implements the solution to the problem. The recursive approach ensures that all possible segments are considered, and the conditions for valid segments are properly checked.

### Correctness:
**True**
