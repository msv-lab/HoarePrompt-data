Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the program sorts the array and then pairs the largest and smallest elements to maximize the difference, which does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
4
10 5 3 7
```

The program would sort the array to `[3, 5, 7, 10]` and then calculate the beauty as `(10-3) + (7-5) = 12`. However, the correct approach would be to rearrange the array such that the differences are maximized. In this case, rearranging the array to `[10, 3, 7, 5]` would yield the maximum beauty of `(10-3) + (7-5) = 12`.

The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then pairing the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences are maximized. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            kq += a[n - i - 1] - a[i]
        if n % 2 != 0:
            kq += a[n // 2]
        print(kq)
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly by properly pairing the elements.
