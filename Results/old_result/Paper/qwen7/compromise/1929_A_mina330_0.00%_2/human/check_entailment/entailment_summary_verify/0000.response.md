### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum beauty of the array \(a\) defined as the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

2. **Original Program Analysis**:
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the sum of differences between elements symmetrically from the ends of the sorted list towards the center.
   - Specifically, for each element pair \((a[i], a[len(a)-i-1])\) where \(i\) ranges from 0 to \(\frac{\text{len}(a)}{2}-1\), it adds the difference \(a[len(a)-i-1] - a[i]\) to the total sum `kq`.
   - If the length of the array is odd, it adds the middle element once.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves sorting the array and then pairing the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
   - This ensures that the differences are maximized because the largest and smallest elements contribute the most to the sum.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4
     10 5 3 7
     ```
   - The original program sorts the array to `[3, 5, 7, 10]` and calculates the beauty as \((10-3) + (7-5) = 12\).
   - However, the correct approach would be to rearrange the array to `[10, 3, 7, 5]`, yielding the maximum beauty of \((10-3) + (7-5) = 12\).

5. **Corrected Program**:
   - The corrected program sorts the array and then pairs the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
   - This ensures that the differences are maximized.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array because it does not follow the optimal pairing strategy. The corrected version provided in the original assessment is indeed the right approach.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the optimal pairing strategy to maximize the beauty of the array.
