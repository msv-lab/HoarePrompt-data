Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `kq` is the sum of `kq` and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - i - 1` and the element at index `i` for the current value of `i`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`.

5. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently some value, let's call it `i_end_prev`.

6. **Adjusting the State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was `i_end_prev`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i_end_prev + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is `i < len(a) // 2`. Therefore, `i_end_prev + 1` must be less than `len(a) // 2`.

7. **New State**:
   - The state of `a` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `a` in the loop.
   - The state of `kq` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `kq` in the loop.
   - The state of `i` changes from `i_end_prev` to `i_end_prev + 1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `kq` is the sum of `kq` and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - (i_end_prev + 1) - 1` and the element at index `i_end_prev + 1`, `i` is `i_end_prev + 1`**.

Since `i_end_prev` is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

**State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `kq` is the sum of `kq` and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - i - 1` and the element at index `i` for the current value of `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `kq` is the sum of `kq` and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - (i + 1) - 1` and the element at index `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
