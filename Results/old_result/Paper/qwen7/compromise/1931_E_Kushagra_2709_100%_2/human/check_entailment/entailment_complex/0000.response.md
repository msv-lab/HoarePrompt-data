### Reasoning:

1. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer `num` within the range \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).
   - The logic is sound: it iterates backward through the string until it finds a non-zero digit, counting the zeros along the way.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to determine the winner based on the total length of the numbers and the zero counts.
   - It calculates the total length of the string representations of the numbers (`tot`).
   - It sorts the zero counts in descending order and removes every second count (`cntvals`).
   - It then subtracts the sum of the zero counts at even indices from `tot`.
   - Finally, it checks if the adjusted total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If true, it returns "Sasha"; otherwise, it returns "Anna".

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program processes each test case correctly by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - The logic in `func_1` aligns with the problem statement and the rules of the game.
   - The conditions for determining the winner are correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the total length of the numbers and the zero counts are calculated accurately.
   - The sorting and removal of every second count in `cntvals` ensure that the final comparison is done correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement.
