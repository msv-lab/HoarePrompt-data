Output State: **`k` must be less than or equal to 0, `i` is the final value of `x`, `ans1` is the initial value of `ans1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` for each iteration from 0 to `k-1`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split into integers, `t` must be greater than 0.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `t`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values, except that now `n`, `k`, and `x` have specific values from the input.
