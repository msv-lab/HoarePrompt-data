Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` decreases the value of `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is currently 0. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `a[0]`, `ans1` is simply decreased by twice whatever value `a[0]` holds. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
