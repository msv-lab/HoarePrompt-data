Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is less than or equal to 0, `k` must be greater than `x`, `i + x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` decreases `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is equal to `x`, and `i + x` is less than `n`, the value of `i + x` remains unchanged. All other conditions and variable relationships remain valid as per the initial state.
