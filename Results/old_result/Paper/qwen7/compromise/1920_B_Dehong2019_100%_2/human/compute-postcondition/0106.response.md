Output State: `i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is the sum of `a[0] - 2 * a[x] - 4 * a[2 + x] + a[2]` if `2 + x < n`, or `a[0] - 2 * a[x] + 2 * a[2]` if `2 + x >= n`, and this pattern continues until the last iteration where `ans1` is updated based on whether `i + x < n` or not, and `ans2` is equal to the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` throughout all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` must still be greater than 0, `ans1` will be the result of applying the loop's operations up to `k` times, and `ans2` will hold the highest value that `ans1` has taken during any iteration of the loop.
