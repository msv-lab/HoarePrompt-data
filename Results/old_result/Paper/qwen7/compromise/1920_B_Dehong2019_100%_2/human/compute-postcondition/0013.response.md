Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is the final value of `x`; `ans1` is the initial value of `ans1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = ans1` simply assigns the current value of `ans1` to `ans2`. This does not change the value of `ans1` or any other variables. The conditions and values of `x`, `i`, and `ans1` remain as they were after the loop.
