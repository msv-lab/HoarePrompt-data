Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `ans1` has been decreased by `a[0] * 2`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `x` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `x` must be greater than 3.
   - The value of `ans1` remains unchanged from the previous iteration (it was decreased by `a[0] * 2`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 3, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`**
