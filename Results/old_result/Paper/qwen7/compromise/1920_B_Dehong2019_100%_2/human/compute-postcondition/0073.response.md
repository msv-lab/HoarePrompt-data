Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input; `ans1` and `ans2` retain their previous maximum values attained during any iteration of the loop; `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means these variables now hold the values entered by the user. The values of `ans1`, `ans2`, and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states because no operations were performed on them within this snippet. `t` is simply decremented by 1.
