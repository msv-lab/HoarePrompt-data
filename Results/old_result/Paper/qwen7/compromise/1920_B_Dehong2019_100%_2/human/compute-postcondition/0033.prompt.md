Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is the final value of `x`; `ans1` is the initial value of `ans1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `ans1` is increased by `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of `a[1]` if `i + x < n`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` before the operation.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` before the operation.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and decreased by `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`. If `i + x` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans1` is still increased by `a[i]`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
