Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to 0, and `x` must be greater than 0. The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[0]` from `ans1`. Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` is used in the calculation. The value of `i` does not change, but `ans1` is updated by subtracting `a[0] * 2`. The condition that `x` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
