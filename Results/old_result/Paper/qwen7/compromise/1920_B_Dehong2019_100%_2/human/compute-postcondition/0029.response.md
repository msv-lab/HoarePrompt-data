Output State: **`k` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `ans1` is decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` updates the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from `ans1`. Since `i` can be either 0 or 1, the value of `i + x` will be either `x` or `1 + x`. However, without knowing the exact value of `a[x]` or `a[1 + x]`, we can only express the change in terms of `a[i + x]`. The conditions for `k` and `i` remain unchanged.
