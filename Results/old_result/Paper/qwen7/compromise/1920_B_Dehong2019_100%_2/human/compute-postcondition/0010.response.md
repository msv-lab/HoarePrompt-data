Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[i]`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must still be greater than `i`, which means `x` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `x` must remain greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2).

6. **Final state**:
   - `x` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The state of `ans1` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`x` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[i]`**.
