Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and then the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This step is crucial because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements and Bob to flip the largest negative contributions to the sum.

3. **Calculating Initial Sum**: The initial sum `ans1` is calculated as the sum of the entire sorted array. This represents the best possible sum if no removals or flips were allowed.

4. **Applying Bob's Optimal Strategy**: The program then iterates through the top `x` elements of the array and subtracts twice their values from `ans1`. This simulates Bob's strategy of flipping the `x` largest elements to minimize the sum.

5. **Applying Alice's Optimal Strategy**: In the next loop, Alice's strategy is applied. She removes the `k` smallest elements from the array. For each removed element, the program checks if the corresponding flipped element (if any) should also be adjusted. The maximum sum `ans2` is updated accordingly.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the maximum sum `ans2` for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
