You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). It then sorts the list in descending order and calculates two values, \( ans1 \) and \( ans2 \). \( ans1 \) is initially set to the sum of the sorted list. It subtracts twice the first \( x \) elements from \( ans1 \). Next, it iterates \( k \) times, each time adjusting \( ans1 \) by adding the current element and subtracting twice the element at position \( i + x \) (if within bounds). \( ans2 \) keeps track of the maximum value of \( ans1 \) during these iterations. Finally, it prints \( ans2 \) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is crucial because we want to maximize the sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves.

3. **Calculating Initial Sum (`ans1`):**
   - The initial sum of the array (`ans1`) is calculated using the sorted array.
   - This step is correct because it sets up the initial state before any removals or negations.

4. **Negating Elements by Bob:**
   - The program iterates through the top `x` elements of the sorted array and subtracts twice their value from `ans1`. This simulates Bob negating these elements.
   - This step is correct because it accounts for Bob's optimal strategy to minimize the sum.

5. **Removing Elements by Alice:**
   - The program iterates through the top `k` elements of the sorted array and adds them to `ans1`.
   - If `i + x < n`, it also subtracts twice the value of the corresponding element from the end of the array. This accounts for the interaction between Alice's removals and Bob's negations.
   - This step is correct because it simulates Alice's optimal strategy to maximize the sum.

6. **Finding the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum sum (`ans2`) after considering the effects of both Alice and Bob's moves.
   - This step is correct because it ensures that the final result is the best possible sum under the given constraints.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. The program handles the sorting, the removals, and the negations as described in the problem statement.
