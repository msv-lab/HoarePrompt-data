Postcondition: `k` is an integer, and `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to it. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decremented by 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement does not break, and `l` is a list with one additional element from `b[i]`.
