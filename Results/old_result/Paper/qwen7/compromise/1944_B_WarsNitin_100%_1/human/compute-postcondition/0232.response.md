Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Initially, `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 of `l` is appended to `ans2`. After appending, `i` is incremented (though not shown in the code snippet, it's implied by the context), making `i` equal to 2. The value of `ans1` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
