Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is the same as before, `k` is either -2 or 0, and `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[2]` if `b[2] != b[3]`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]` is true, then `i` is set to 3, `ans1` now contains `b[2]` and `b[3]`, and `k` is set to -2. Otherwise, `l` is updated to contain the element `b[3]` if `b[3] != b[2]`.
