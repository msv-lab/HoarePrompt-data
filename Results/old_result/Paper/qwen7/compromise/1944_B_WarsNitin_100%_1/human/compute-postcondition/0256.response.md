Output State: **`k` is not 0, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` slices the list `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list and assigns it to `c`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
