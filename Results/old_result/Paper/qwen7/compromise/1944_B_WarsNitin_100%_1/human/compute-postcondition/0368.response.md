Output State: **`k` is -1, `ans1` has the element `l[0]` and `l[3]` appended to it, `ans2` has the elements `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[3]` appended to it, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. The value of `i` remains 3 as it is not involved in the operation.
