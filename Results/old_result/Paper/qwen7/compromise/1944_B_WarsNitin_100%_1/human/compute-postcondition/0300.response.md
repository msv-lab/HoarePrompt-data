Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is the same as before, `k` is either -2 or 0, and `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[2]` if `b[2] != b[3]` or the element `b[3]` if `b[3] != b[2]`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]` is true, then `k` is -2 and `l` remains unchanged. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]` is true, then `l` is updated to contain the element `b[3]` if `b[3] != b[2]`.
