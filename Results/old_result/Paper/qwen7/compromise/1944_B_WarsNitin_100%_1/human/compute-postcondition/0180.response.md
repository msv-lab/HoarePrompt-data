Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` is 0. If `b[2]` is equal to `b[1]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, then the condition remains unchanged. If `b[2]` equals `b[3]`, then the condition also remains unchanged.
