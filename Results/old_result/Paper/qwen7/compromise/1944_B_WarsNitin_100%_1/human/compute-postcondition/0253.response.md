Output State: **`k` is not 0, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `i`, `q`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. `k` is explicitly stated to be not 0 in the initial state, which remains true after the assignment.
