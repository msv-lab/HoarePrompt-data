Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts each string into an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
