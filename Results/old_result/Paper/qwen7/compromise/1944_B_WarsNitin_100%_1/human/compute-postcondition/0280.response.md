Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, n - 2], `k` is equal to -2, a break has occurred from the most internal loop or if statement, and the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i - 1]`; `ans1` now contains the elements `[b[i]]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it `-2`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
