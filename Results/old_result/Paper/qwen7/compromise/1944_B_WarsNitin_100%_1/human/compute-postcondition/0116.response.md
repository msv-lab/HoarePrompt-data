Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `k` is -1, `ans2` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `c[1]` to `c[n-2]` twice each and the element `l[n-1]` and `l[i]`, `ans1` now includes the elements `l[n-1]` and `l[i]`, `l[i]` is appended to `ans2`**.

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the value of `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is `n-2`, `k` is -1, `ans2` initially contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `c[1]` to `c[n-2]` twice each and the element `l[n-1]`, and `ans1` includes the elements `l[n-1]` and `l[i]`, the only change is that `l[i]` (which is `l[n-2]`) is appended to `ans2`.
