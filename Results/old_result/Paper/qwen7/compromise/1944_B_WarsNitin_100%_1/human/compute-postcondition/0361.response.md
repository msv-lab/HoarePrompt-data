Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans1` has the element `l[0]` appended to it, `ans2` has the elements `l[0]` and `l[1]` appended to it, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. Initially, `k` is `-1`, so after executing the code, `k` becomes `0`. The values of `ans1`, `ans2`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
