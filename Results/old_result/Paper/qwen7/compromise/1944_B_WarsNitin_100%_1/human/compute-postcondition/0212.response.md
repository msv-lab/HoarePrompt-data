Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is either 0 or -2; `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended and `c[2]` appended.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `c[2]` is appended to `ans2`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
