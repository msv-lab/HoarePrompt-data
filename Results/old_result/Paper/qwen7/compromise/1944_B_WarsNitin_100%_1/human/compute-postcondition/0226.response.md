Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(l)`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index in the range from `0` to `len(l) - 1`. Therefore, `i` will take values from `0` to `len(l) - 1`.

3. **Initial conditions given**: We know that after the loop completes, `i` should be `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the list `l`. This means that the loop must run until `i` reaches `len(l) - 1`.

4. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `0` and increments by `1` each time, the initial value of `i` must be `0`.

5. **Determine the value of `len(l)`**: For the loop to run until `i` reaches `n-1`, `len(l)` must be equal to `n`.

6. **Other variables**: The variables `k`, `ans2`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(l)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `len(l)` is `n`**
