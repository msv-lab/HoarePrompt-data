Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `k` is -1, `ans2` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `c[1]` to `c[n-2]` twice each and the element `l[n-1]`, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `ans1` now includes the elements `l[n-1]` and `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the value of `l[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`. After executing the code, `i` is decremented by 1 (since the loop or statement that was containing this line would have decreased `i` by 1), making `i` equal to `n-2`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition.
