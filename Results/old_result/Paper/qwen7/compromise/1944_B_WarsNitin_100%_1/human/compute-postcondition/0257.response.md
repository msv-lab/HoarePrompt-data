Output State: **`k` is not 0, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` now contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted, while `c` still contains the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.
