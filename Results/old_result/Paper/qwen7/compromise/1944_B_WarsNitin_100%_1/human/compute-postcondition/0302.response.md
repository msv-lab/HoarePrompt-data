Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is the same as before
   - `k` is either -2 or 0
   - `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[2]` if `b[2] != b[3]`
   - Additional postconditions:
     - If `b[i] == b[i - 1]` is true, then `i` is set to 3, `ans1` now contains `b[2]` and `b[3]`, and `k` is set to -2.
     - Otherwise, `l` is updated to contain the element `b[3]` if `b[3] != b[2]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `n - 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, the loop will execute again if `n > 4`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that can change is `i`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 4.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` and `l` are not directly affected by the loop condition alone; their values depend on the loop body, but they do not change based solely on the loop condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` becomes 4
- `n` remains the same
- `k` and `l` remain unchanged (since the loop condition does not directly affect them)

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is the same as before, `k` is either -2 or 0, `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[2]` if `b[2] != b[3]`**
