Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is -2, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[3]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains -2 and `ans2` contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[3]`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
