Postcondition: **`k` is an input integer, `i` is `len(l) - 2`, `q` is `len(l) - 2`, `t` is `len(l) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted, `req` is `k`. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list with two elements: the smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a` and the second smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a`. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by 2, `l` is a list with one element which is the smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ans1` now contains the second last element of `b`.**
