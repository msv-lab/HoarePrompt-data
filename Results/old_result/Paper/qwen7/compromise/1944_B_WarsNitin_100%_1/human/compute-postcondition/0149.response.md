Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(1, n - 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the range is `range(1, n - 1)`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is 1 and that `n` is greater than 1 (so that `i < n - 1` holds true initially).

Given the postconditions and the loop head, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute.

The other variables (`k`, `q`, `a`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, `l`, `b`) do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
