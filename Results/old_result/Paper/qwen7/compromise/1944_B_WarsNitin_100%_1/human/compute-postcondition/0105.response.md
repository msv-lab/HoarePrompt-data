Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `c[1]` to `c[n-2]` twice each, and `l` must have at least 1 element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `ans2`, and `l` remain unchanged.
