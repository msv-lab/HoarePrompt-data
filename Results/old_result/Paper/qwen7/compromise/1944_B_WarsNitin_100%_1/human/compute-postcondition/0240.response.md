Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans1` now contains the element at index 2 of list `l`; `ans2` now contains the element at index 2 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify what `k` is, we assume `k` was equal to `i`, which is 2. After executing `k -= 1`, `k` becomes 1. However, the values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `len(l)` must be at least 2 also remains valid.
