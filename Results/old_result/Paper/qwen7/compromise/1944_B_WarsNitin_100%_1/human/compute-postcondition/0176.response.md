Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` is 0; `l` contains the element `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to list `l`. Given that `i` is 2, `l` will now contain the element `b[2]`. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
