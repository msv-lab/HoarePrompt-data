Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is either 0 or -2; `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended and `c[i]` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends `c[i]` to `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `c[i]` is `c[2]`. Since `ans2` already contains the value of `c[1]` appended, now it also contains `c[2]` appended. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
