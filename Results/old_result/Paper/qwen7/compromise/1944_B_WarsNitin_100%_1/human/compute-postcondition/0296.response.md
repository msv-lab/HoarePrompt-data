Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans1` now contains `b[2]` and `b[3]`, `n` is the same as before, `k` is -2, and `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[2]` if `b[2] != b[3]`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2. Initially, `k` was either -2 or 0. After decrementing by 2, `k` becomes -2. The values of `i`, `ans1`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
