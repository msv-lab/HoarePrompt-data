Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or -2, `ans2` contains the elements `[c[3], c[3]]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`. Since `ans2` originally contained the element `c[3]`, after appending `c[3]` again, `ans2` now contains `[c[3], c[3]]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
