Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, n - 2], k equals 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly shown in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `k`. It simply indicates that if there was a loop or conditional block, it would be exited. Therefore, the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement is noted as exiting the most internal loop or if statement.
