Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the same as before, `k` is either -2 or 0, and `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[2]` if `b[2] != b[3]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
