Output State: **`k` is an integer - 1; `ans1` has the element `l[0]` appended to it; `ans2` has the element `l[0]` appended to it, and `ans2` has the element `l[1]` appended to it; `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the element `l[1]` is appended to `ans2`. Since `ans1` was previously updated with `l[0]`, the values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged except for the new element appended to `ans2`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2.
