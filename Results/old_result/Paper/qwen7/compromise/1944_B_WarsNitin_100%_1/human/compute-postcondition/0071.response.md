Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `k` equals 0, `l` contains the elements as follows: if any two consecutive elements in `b` from index 1 to `n-2` are the same, then those elements are appended to `l` twice or once depending on their count, and `ans1` contains the repeated elements as described in the previous states.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-2` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive). The condition `k == 0` ensures that the loop breaks when `k` reaches zero. For each iteration, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, the element `b[i]` is appended twice to `ans1` and `k` decreases by 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, the element `b[i]` is appended to `l`. This process continues until `i` reaches `n-2`. Therefore, `l` will contain the repeated elements from `b` as described, and `ans1` will also reflect these repeated elements based on the conditions met during the loop's execution.
