Output State: **`i` is -1, `a` is a list starting with 1000 and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, and a new string `line` is input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `a`, `result`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
