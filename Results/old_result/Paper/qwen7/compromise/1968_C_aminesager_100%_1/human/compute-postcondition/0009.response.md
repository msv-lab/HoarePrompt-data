Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` has an additional element which is equal to `a[0] + T[0]`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop runs as long as `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

6. **Keep the state of `a` unchanged** because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` has an additional element which is equal to `a[0] + T[0]`**.
