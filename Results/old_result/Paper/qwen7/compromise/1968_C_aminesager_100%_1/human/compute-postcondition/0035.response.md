Output State: **`i` is -1, `a` is a list starting with 1000 and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial values of `i`, `a`, `result`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `n` which is the integer input from the user.
