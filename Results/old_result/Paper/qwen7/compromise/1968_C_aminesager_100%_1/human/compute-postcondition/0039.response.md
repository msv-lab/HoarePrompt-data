Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially -1.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is -1, it does not affect the loop execution directly. However, the loop will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until it reaches `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is -1, `a` is a list starting with 1000 followed by an empty list, `result` is a string containing "1000" separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `line` is the user-inputted string converted to a list of integers**.
