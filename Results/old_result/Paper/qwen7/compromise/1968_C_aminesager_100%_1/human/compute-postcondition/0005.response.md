Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is the string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each substring to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` takes the string `line` input by the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, and then converts each substring to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `T`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `line` remain unchanged from their initial states.
