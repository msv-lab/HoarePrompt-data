Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
