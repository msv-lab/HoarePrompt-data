Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: `kq1` is a string containing the cumulative concatenation of the smaller values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b` based on their comparison throughout all iterations. `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative concatenation of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b` based on their comparison throughout all iterations. `vt` is 1, indicating that there was at least one non-equal comparison during the loop's execution. `i` is equal to `len(a)`, and `q` is `t`, which is the total number of iterations. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
