Output State: **`kq1` is "y", `kq2` is "x", `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))**.

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` concatenates the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. Initially, `kq2` is an empty string, so after executing the code, `kq2` becomes `"x"`. The values of `kq1`, `vt`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
