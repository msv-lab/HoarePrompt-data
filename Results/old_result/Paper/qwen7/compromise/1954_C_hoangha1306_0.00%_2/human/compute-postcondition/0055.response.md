Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` to `x` and the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` to `y`. Since the exact values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not provided, `x` and `y` are expressed in terms of these values. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified but implied to be unchanged.
