Postcondition: `kq1` is either "x" or 'y' followed by the value of the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. Additionally, `kq1` can also be "xy", in which case `kq2` includes the value of `x`, and `vt`, `i`, `q`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
