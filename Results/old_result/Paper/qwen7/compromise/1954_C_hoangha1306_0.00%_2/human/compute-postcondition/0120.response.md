Postcondition: **`kq1` is either "x" or 'y' concatenated with the value of `a[i]` if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it is either "x" or 'y' followed by the value of the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, possibly including `a[i]` if the condition is met, or the original cumulative string plus the value of `x`. `vt` is 0, `i` is either 3 or 2, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`.**
