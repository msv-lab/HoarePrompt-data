Postcondition: `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is a string that includes either the string representation of `x` or `y` (depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`) appended to it, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representation of the other number appended to it, and `a[i]` retains its original value, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop if the condition `a[i] == b[i]` is false.
