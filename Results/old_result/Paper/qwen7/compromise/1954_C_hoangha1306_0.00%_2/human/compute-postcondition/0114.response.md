Postcondition: `kq1` is either "x" or 'y' followed by the value of the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b` with the addition of `str(y)` at the end if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `kq2` contains the cumulative string of the larger values plus the value of `x`. `vt` is 1, `i` is either 3 or 2, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the larger of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`.
