Output State: **`kq1` is 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))', `kq2` is 'y', `vt` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))**.

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to `kq2`. Given that `y` is initially `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `kq2` is updated to be the concatenation of its current value (which is an empty string) and the string representation of `y`. Since `kq2` was initially an empty string, after appending `str(y)`, `kq2` becomes `'y'`. All other variables (`kq1`, `vt`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
