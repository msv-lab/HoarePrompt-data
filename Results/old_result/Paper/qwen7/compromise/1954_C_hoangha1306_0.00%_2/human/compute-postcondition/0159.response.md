Output State: **`kq1` is 'x', `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, `vt` is 1, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**

In this step, the code appends the string representation of `y` (which is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`) to the existing value of `kq2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
