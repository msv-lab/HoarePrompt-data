Postcondition: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `vt` is 1, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `kq1` is 'x' and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq2` is the string representation of `x` without its last character, and `i` is incremented.
