Output State: **`vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

Explanation: The variable `vt` is assigned the value 1, which does not affect the values of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are determined by the minimum and maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, respectively.
