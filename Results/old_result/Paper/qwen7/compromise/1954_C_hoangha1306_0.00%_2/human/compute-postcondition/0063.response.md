Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is a string that includes `str(y)` appended to it.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state. However, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to its current value.
