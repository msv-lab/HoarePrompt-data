Postcondition: `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1, `i` is 1, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the larger of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`.
