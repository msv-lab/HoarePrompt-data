Postcondition: `kq1` is either the string "x" or "y", `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. `vt` is 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the smaller of `int(a[i-1])` and `int(b[i-1])`.
