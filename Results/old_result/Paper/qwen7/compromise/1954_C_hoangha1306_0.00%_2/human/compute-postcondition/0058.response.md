Output State: **`vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y`**.

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` concatenates the string representation of `y` to the end of `kq2`. The values of `vt`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. `kq1` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `x` to it, but since no such operation was performed on `kq2`, it remains unchanged from its initial state.
