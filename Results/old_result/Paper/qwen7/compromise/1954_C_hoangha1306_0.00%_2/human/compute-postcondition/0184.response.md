Postcondition: **`kq1` is a string concatenated with either `str(int(a[i]))` or `str(y)`, and `kq2` is a string concatenated with either `str(y)` or `str(x)`. Both `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `vt` is 1, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**
