Output State: **`kq2` is now the value of `kq2 + a[i]`, and `a[i]` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `kq2` is assigned the value of itself plus `a[i]`. Since `kq1` is defined as `kq1 + a[i]` in the initial state, it already includes the value of `a[i]`. However, `a[i]` retains its original value as specified in the initial state. Therefore, `kq2` is updated to include `a[i]` in its current value.
