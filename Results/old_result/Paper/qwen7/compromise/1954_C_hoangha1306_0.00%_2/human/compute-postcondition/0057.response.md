Output State: **`vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)` concatenates the string representation of `x` to the end of the current value of `kq1`. The values of `vt`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
