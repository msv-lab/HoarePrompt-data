Output State: **`kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' + str(min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))) or '0' + str(min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))); `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' + str(y) or 'x' + str(y); `vt` is 1; `i` is 2; `x` is `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1])); `y` is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))**.

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` (which is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`) to the end of `kq2`. Since `kq2` was either `'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))'` or `'x'`, it now becomes either `'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' + str(y)` or `'x' + str(y)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
