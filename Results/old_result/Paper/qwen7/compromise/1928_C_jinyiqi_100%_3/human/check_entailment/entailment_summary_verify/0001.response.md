### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received.
   - It checks two conditions using `func_1` to find potential values of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of \( x \), including both the divisors and their complements.
   - The function is used to find potential values of \( k \) from the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The code checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even.
   - If they are even, it uses the divisors found by `func_1` to check if they satisfy the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

6. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for finding divisors and checking the conditions seems correct.
   - The handling of duplicates by converting to a set is appropriate.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the way the divisors are being used to derive \( k \).

### Detailed Analysis:

- The function `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of \( x \), but the code incorrectly assumes that these divisors directly correspond to possible values of \( k \).
- Specifically, the code checks if \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \) for each divisor \( s \) of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \). This condition is not directly related to the settling pattern described in the problem statement.
- The settling pattern involves a repeating sequence of \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, \ldots, 2 \), and the value of \( k \) should be derived from the position and the number Vasya received, not just from the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).

### Example Counterexample:

Consider the test case:
- \( n = 10 \)
- \( x = 2 \)

The settling pattern for \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) is correctly identified. However, the code incorrectly handles other potential values of \( k \) because it relies on the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) without correctly mapping them to the settling pattern.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the period \( 2k - 2 \) from the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).
2. Determine the value of \( k \) based on the position and the number Vasya received.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it misinterprets the relationship between the divisors and the settling pattern. The original assessment was inaccurate due to this fundamental flaw.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
