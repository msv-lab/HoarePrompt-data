Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being 1 (the smallest value in the range).

4. **Check the Range Expression:**
   - The range is defined as `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be a positive integer, which means `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least 1.

5. **Determine the Condition for `x`:**
   - Since `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least 1, `x` must be at least 1.
   - However, given the initial state constraints, `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`, we know `x` is already within this range.

6. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` should be a positive integer.
   - This implies `x` must be at least 1 (which is already satisfied by the initial state).

7. **List the Adjusted States:**
   - The variables `i` and `x` are the ones that need adjustment.
   - `i` starts at 1.
   - `x` must be such that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is a valid starting point for the loop.

Given these considerations, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 1**
