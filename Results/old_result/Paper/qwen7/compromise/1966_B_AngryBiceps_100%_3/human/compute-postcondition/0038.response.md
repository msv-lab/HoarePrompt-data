Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is an input integer and the second element is the input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the first element of the last sublist in `a`, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding the first element of the last sublist in `a` to its current value. Since `a` is a list containing two elements and the second element is a sublist, `a[-1][0]` refers to the first element of this sublist. Therefore, `first_row` is now equal to its original value plus the first element of the last sublist in `a`.
