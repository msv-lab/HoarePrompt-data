Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the first input from the user and the second element is the second input from the user, `first_row` is the first element of the list `a` plus the first element of the last sublist in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last sublist in the list `a` plus the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding the first element of the last sublist (`a[-1][0]`) to its current value. Since `a` contains only one sublist (because it has two elements), `a[-1][0]` is the same as the first element of the list `a`. Therefore, `first_row` is updated to be the sum of the first element of the list `a` and itself. The other variables remain unchanged.
