Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a grid represented by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' (for white) and 'B' (for black). The function returns the count of test cases that meet certain conditions based on the grid configuration.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over multiple test cases, each defined by a grid of size n x m. It then evaluates each grid according to some criteria (which are not specified here) and counts how many of these grids meet those criteria. The final output is the total count of such grids across all test cases.
