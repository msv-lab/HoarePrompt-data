Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` adds the last element of the last element of the list `a` to the current value of `last_row`. Since `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user, and assuming the user input is a nested list, `last_row` is updated accordingly.
