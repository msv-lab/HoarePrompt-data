Postcondition: `i` is `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus (n-1) times the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`, `m` is an input integer, and the following conditions hold:
- Either the first row of `a` is a list with all elements the same, the last row of `a` is a list with all elements the same, and the first row is different from the last row.
- Or the first row of `a` contains at least two different elements, or the last row of `a` contains at least two different elements, or the first row is equal to the last row.
