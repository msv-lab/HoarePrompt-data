Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n+1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `last_row` is the input integer plus (n-1) times the last element of the last sublist in `a`
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from `input()`
- `first_row` is the input integer plus the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`
- `m` is an input integer
- `a[0]` contains at least two different elements, or `a[-1]` contains at least two different elements, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`
- The first row and last row are identical sets with at least one element but different from each other

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
