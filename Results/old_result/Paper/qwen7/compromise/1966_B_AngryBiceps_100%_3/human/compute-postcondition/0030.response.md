Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to `first_row`. This means that the concatenation of the first characters of the elements in the list `a` is now an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
