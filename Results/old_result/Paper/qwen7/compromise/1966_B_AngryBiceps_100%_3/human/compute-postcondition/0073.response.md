Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input provided by the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the first element in list `a` and the first element of the last element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a` plus the last element of the last element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments the value of `last_row` by the value of `a[-1][-1]`. Since `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `last_row` is updated to its current value plus this last element. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
