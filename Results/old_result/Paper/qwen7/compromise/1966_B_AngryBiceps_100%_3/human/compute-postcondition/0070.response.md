Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user.
   - `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **New States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same (non-negative integer).
   - `a` remains the same (list containing one element which is the input provided by the user).
   - `first_row` remains the same (equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`).
   - `last_row` remains the same (the last element of the last element in list `a`).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`**
