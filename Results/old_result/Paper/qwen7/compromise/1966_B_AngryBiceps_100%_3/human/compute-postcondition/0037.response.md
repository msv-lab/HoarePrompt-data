Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is an input integer and the second element is the input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one element, which is an input integer. After appending the new input, `a` now contains two elements: the first element is the original input integer, and the second element is the new input from `input()`. All other variables remain unchanged.
