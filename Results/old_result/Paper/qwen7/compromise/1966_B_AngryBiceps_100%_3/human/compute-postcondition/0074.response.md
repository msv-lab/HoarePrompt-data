Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input provided by the user.
   - `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the first element in list `a` and the first element of the last element in list `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a` plus the last element of the last element in list `a`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration but must still satisfy the condition `i < n`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

6. **Final State**:
   - `n` must be a non-negative integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The values of `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` do not change because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 2**.
