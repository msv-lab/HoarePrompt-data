Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ t, `inp` is a tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is n + 1, `y` is n + 1, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
