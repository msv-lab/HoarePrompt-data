Postcondition: `a` is the first element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is \(n + 1\), and `y` is \(n + 1\). If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is now equal to `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1 and `x` is not equal to `y`.
