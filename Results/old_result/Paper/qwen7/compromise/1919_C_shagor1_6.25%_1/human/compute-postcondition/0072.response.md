Output State: **`a` is assigned to `y`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` and `y` are both `n + 1`.**

This means that the value of `a` (the third element of the tuple `inp`) is now assigned to `y`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
