Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is the last element of the tuple `inp`.
- `x` is the minimum value among all elements of `inp` that are less than or equal to `x` seen so far.
- `y` is the minimum value among all elements of `inp` that are greater than `x` but less than or equal to `y` seen so far.
- `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`.

To understand this more clearly:
- `a` is the last element of `inp`.
- `x` is determined by finding the minimum value of all elements in `inp` that are less than or equal to `x` seen so far.
- `y` is determined by finding the minimum value of all elements in `inp` that are greater than `x` but less than or equal to `y` seen so far.
- `ans` counts how many elements in `inp` are greater than `y`.

Given these definitions, the value of `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in inp that are greater than y)**
