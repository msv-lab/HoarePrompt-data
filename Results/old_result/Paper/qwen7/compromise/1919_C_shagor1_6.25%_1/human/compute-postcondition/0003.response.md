Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ t, `inp` is a tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is n + 1, `y` is n + 1**.

The code assigns the value of `n + 1` to both `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `inp` remain unchanged.
