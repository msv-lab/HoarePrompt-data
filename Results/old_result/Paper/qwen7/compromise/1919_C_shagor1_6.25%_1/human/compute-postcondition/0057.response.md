Postcondition: **`a` is the first element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is \(n + 1\), and `y` is now equal to `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `x == y` is evaluated to False.**
