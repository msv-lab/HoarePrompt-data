Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is now `a`, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of `inp`, and `a > x`.**

The value of `y` is updated to be equal to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
