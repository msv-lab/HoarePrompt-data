Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is now equal to the second element of `inp` (denoted as `a`), `ans` is 1 if the next element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `a` is the second element of `inp`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to the second element of the tuple `inp` (denoted as `a`). All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
