Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ t, `inp` is a tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns these integers to the tuple `inp`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
