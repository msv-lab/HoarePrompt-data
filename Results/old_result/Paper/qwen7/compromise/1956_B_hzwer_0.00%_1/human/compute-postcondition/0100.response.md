Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a sequence of integers within specified constraints and returns the maximum value stored in the cell dp[0][0] of the 2D list dp.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a sequence of integers (cards) and their counts, processes them according to certain conditions, and returns the optimal solution represented by the maximum value in dp[0][0].
