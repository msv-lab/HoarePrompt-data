Output State: The variable `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it holds the maximum value determined by the conditions given in the loop, considering the counts of each card value in the `cards` list. The `t` and `n` variables remain unchanged, with `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. The `cards` list also remains unchanged, being a list of integers derived from the input.

This final state represents the complete execution of the loop where `i` starts from `n-3` and decreases to `0`, and `j` starts from `n-1` and decreases to `0`. The `dp` table is fully populated with the optimal values calculated according to the given conditions, reflecting the maximum possible sum achievable under the constraints defined by the counts of each card value in the `cards` list.
