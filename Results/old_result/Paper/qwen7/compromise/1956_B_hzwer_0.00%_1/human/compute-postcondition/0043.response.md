Output State: **`i` is `n-5`, `j` is `-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged. `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by taking the maximum of two values: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` was originally `n-4` and `j` was `-1`, after executing the line `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`, `i` is now updated to `n-5` because the indices are adjusted accordingly. The values of `t`, `n`, the `cards` list, and the rest of the `dp` list remain unchanged.
