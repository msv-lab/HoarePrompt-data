Output State: The variable `i` remains `n-3`, `j` becomes `-1` after the loop completes since the loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`. The `dp` table, which is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros, will have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it will hold the maximum value determined by the conditions given in the loop body. The `t` and `n` variables remain unchanged, with `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. The `cards` list also remains unchanged, being a list of integers derived from the input.

The final state of `dp` will reflect the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop, considering the counts of each card value in the `cards` list and updating the `dp` table accordingly for all possible values of `i` and `j` until `j` reaches `-1`.
