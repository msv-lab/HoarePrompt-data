Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-3`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list also remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `i + 1` will be 1 or 0 respectively. The value of `j` remains `n-3`. Variables `t`, `n`, and the `cards` list are not affected by this operation.
