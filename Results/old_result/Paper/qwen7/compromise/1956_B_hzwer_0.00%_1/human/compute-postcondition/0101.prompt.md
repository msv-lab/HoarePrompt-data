You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The input for each test case consists of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the `dp` table is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element has been updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it holds the maximum value determined by the conditions given in the loop body, considering the counts of each card value in the `cards` list. The `t` and `n` variables remain unchanged, with `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. The `cards` list also remains unchanged, being a list of integers derived from the input.
    #
    #This final state represents the complete execution of the loop where `i` starts from `n-3` and decreases to `0`, and `j` starts from `n-1` and decreases to `0`. The `dp` table is fully populated with the maximum values calculated according to the given conditions, providing the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the maximum value stored in the cell dp[0][0] of the 2D list dp, which was populated during the execution of the loop based on the conditions specified for each cell dp[i][j]. This value represents the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop, considering the counts of each card value in the cards list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a sequence of integers within specified constraints and returns the maximum value stored in the cell dp[0][0] of the 2D list dp.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value stored in the cell dp[0][0] of the 2D list dp, which was populated during the execution of the loop based on the conditions specified for each cell dp[i][j]. This value represents the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop, considering the counts of each card value in the cards list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
