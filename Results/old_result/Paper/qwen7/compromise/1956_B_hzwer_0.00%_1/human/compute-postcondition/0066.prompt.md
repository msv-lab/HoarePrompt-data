Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-4`, `j` is `-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `j` is `-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros (except for `dp[i][j]` which is updated based on the condition). `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `j` is `0`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except for `dp[i][j]` which is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `j` is `0`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
