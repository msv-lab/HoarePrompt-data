Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `n-3` down to `0`. The loop condition is `i >= 0`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` remains `n-3`.
   - `j` becomes `-1` after the loop completes.
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros.
   - `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `cards` list remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n-4`.
   - `j` will still be `-1` because it is set to `-1` after the loop completes, and the loop body does not change its value.
   - `dp`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `cards` list remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is `n-4`, `j` is `-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged.**
