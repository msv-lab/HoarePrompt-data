Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `n-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `i` is 1, then `dp[1][n-1]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[2][n-1]` and `dp[3][n-2] + 1` if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, otherwise `dp` remains unchanged.
