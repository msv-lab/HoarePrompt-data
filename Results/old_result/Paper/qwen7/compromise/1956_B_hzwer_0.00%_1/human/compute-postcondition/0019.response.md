Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n-3`
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)`, filled with zeros
- `dp[n-1][0]` is 0
- `dp[n-2][0]` is 0
- `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
- `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`
- `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers
- `j` is `n-1`
- `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the conditions given in the loop body

### Loop Head:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Loop Body Analysis:
- The loop variable `j` starts from `n-1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`.
- Inside the loop, `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the conditions involving `cards.count(j + 1)`.

### States to Adjust:
- The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `j`.
- `i` remains constant throughout the loop iterations since it is not modified within the loop.
- Other variables like `dp`, `t`, `n`, and `cards` are not directly modified by the loop itself but may be used in the loop body.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `i` is `n-3`
   - `j` is `n-1`
   
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In the first iteration, `j` is `n-1`.
   - `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the conditions involving `cards.count(j + 1)`.
   - After the first iteration, `j` is decremented to `n-2`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - `i` remains `n-3`
   - `j` is now `n-2`
   - `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the new value of `j`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` remains `n-3`
- `j` is now `n-2`
- `dp` is updated based on the previous iteration's logic.
- `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` remain unchanged.
- `t`, `n`, and `cards` remain unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n-3`, `j` is `n-2`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)`, filled with zeros; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `dp[n-2][0]` is 0; `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`; `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`; `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**
