Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

In this case, the code sets the value of `dp[n-1][0]` to 0. All other variables and their initial conditions remain unchanged.
