Postcondition: **x and y are non-negative integers. If both x and y are greater than 0, then `bxsfory` is equal to the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, `bxsfory1` is 1, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. If x is 0 and y is a non-negative integer greater than 0, then x remains 0, y is set to a, and a is a list of integers. Otherwise, x and y retain their original values where either x is 0 or y is not 0.**
