Functionality: **The function processes two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. It calculates and prints the total number of icons based on specific conditions. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it updates `x` and calculates the sum of the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 and 1. If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the ceiling of `y` divided by 2. If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the ceiling of `x` divided by 15. In all other cases, it prints 0.**
