Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If \( n \) is odd, the program checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
   - If \( 2a < b \), it means buying two yogurts for \( b \) burles is cheaper than buying each yogurt at \( a \) burles. In this case, it calculates the total cost as \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as \( a \times n \).

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If \( n \) is even, the program directly calculates the total cost as \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \) because buying two yogurts for \( b \) burles is always cheaper than buying each yogurt individually when \( n \) is even.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all scenarios and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
