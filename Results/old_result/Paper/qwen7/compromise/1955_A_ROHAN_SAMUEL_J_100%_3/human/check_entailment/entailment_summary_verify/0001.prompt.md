You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is odd or even and compares \( 2a \) with \( b \). Based on these conditions, it prints either \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \) if \( n \) is odd, and either \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \) if \( n \) is even. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   
2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Calculation:**
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`):
     - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it uses the promotion price for pairs of yogurts and buys the last yogurt at the regular price: `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`):
     - It directly checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the regular price (`a`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it uses the promotion price for all pairs of yogurts: `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly.
   - It considers the promotion price for buying pairs of yogurts and compares it with the regular price to minimize the cost.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so use the promotion price: `2 * 9 = 18` (but since we're buying 2, it's actually `9`).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so use the promotion price for pairs and regular price for the last: `1 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 14`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so use the regular price for all: `3 * 5 = 15`.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so use the regular price for all: `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program correctly handles all these cases.
