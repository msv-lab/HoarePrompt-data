Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing the result of the conditional logic within the loop for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, if `n` is odd, it will print either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b + a`, depending on whether `2 * a < b` is true or false. If `n` is even, it will print either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b`, again depending on whether `2 * a < b` is true or false. The number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases provided as input.
