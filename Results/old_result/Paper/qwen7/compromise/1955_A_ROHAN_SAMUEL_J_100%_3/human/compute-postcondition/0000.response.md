Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition directly.
   - The key part of the loop head is `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input and uses it to determine the number of iterations.

3. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value.
   - Given the constraints, `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

4. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This means that when the loop starts, `t` is already set to a valid value that will allow the loop to execute.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `t` is already set to a valid value, no adjustment is needed for `t`.
   - The loop will read this value from `t` and use it to determine the number of iterations.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is simply ensuring that `t` is within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
