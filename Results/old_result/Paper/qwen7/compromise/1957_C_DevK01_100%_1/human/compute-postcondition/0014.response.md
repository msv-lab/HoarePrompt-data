Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5. It calculates a sequence using a dynamic programming approach and returns the last element of the resulting list. The sequence is generated by iterating from 2 to `n`, where each new element is computed based on the previous two elements modulo 10^9 + 7. The function ultimately returns the second element of the final list, which is 10302 for the given constraints.**
