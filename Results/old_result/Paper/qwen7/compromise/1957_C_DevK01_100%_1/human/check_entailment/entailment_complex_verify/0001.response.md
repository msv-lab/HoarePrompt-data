### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Breakdown and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It then processes each of the `k` moves, reducing the effective size of the board by 2 if the move is mirrored and by 1 if it is not.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of possible final configurations of the board.
   - The base cases `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1` are correct.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)` is appropriate for calculating the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `i x i` board.
   - The function correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

3. **Board Reduction Logic**:
   - The logic to reduce the board size based on the moves is correct. If a move is mirrored, it effectively reduces the board size by 2. If not, it reduces by 1.
   - The reduction logic is applied correctly before calling `func_1`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied in the dynamic programming function to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly explains the behavior of the dynamic programming function and the board reduction logic.
- The state transitions and calculations are consistent with the problem requirements.
- The final value returned by `func_1` is indeed the correct number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the correctness of the provided solution. The program correctly handles the board reduction and computes the number of configurations using dynamic programming.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
