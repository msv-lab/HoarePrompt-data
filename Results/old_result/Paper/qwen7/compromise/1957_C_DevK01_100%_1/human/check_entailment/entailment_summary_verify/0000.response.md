### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves where no two rooks attack each other.
- The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the number of configurations using a dynamic programming approach.
- The program updates `n` based on the moves made, but the logic for updating `n` might be incorrect.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to compute a sequence where each element depends on the previous two elements.
- The formula used in the function is:
  \[
  dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
  \]
- The function returns the last element of the resulting list, which is computed based on the sequence starting from `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
- It then reads `k` moves and updates `n` based on the moves:
  - If `a != b`, it subtracts 2 from `n` (since the move is not mirrored).
  - If `a == b`, it subtracts 1 from `n` (since the move is mirrored and the computer skips its turn).

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The logic for updating `n` seems to be correct because it accounts for both mirrored and non-mirrored moves.
- However, the function `func_1` is designed to compute a specific sequence, not directly related to the number of configurations.
- The function `func_1` computes a sequence that is not directly relevant to the problem of counting configurations. Instead, it should be used to compute the number of configurations based on the remaining space on the board.

#### Verification:
- Let's verify the program with the example given in the problem statement:
  - For the test case `4 1 1 2`, the program correctly updates `n` to 2 (since `1 != 2` and `n -= 2`).
  - The function `func_1(2)` should return the correct number of configurations for a 2x2 board, which is 3.

Given the analysis, the program logic for updating `n` is correct, but the use of `func_1` is incorrect. The function `func_1` should be replaced with a correct approach to count the configurations based on the remaining space on the board.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses `func_1` incorrectly. The function `func_1` should be replaced with a correct approach to count the configurations based on the remaining space on the board.
