Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic for updating `n` does not accurately reflect the constraints of the problem. The program subtracts 2 from `n` whenever a move is not mirrored, but it does not handle the case where the move is mirrored correctly. Additionally, the function `func_1` is not designed to solve the problem as described.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 1
  1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The correct number of configurations is 3, as explained in the note.

- Program Output:
  - The program incorrectly calculates the number of configurations, likely due to the flawed logic in updating `n`.

The program fails to properly account for the constraints and the nature of the problem, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
