Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where both dimensions of the rectangle are even. According to the problem description, if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and reassemble them into a different rectangle. However, the current implementation checks only for the conditions where both dimensions are odd or where one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is not comprehensive.

For example, consider the test case \(2 \times 4\):

- Both dimensions are even.
- The program should output "YES" because Bob can cut the \(2 \times 4\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and reassemble them into a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.
- However, the program outputs "NO" because it does not account for the case where both dimensions are even.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
