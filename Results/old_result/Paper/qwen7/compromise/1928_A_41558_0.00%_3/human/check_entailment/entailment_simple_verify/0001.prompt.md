You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. Specifically, for each pair (a, b) entered, if both a and b are odd, or if a/2 equals b or b/2 equals a, the output will be 'NO', otherwise it will be 'YES'. The total number of outputs will be equal to the value of n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for "NO"**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints "NO". This condition is correct because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle along either dimension will result in two smaller odd-dimensional rectangles, which cannot form a new distinct rectangle.
   - The program also checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If true, it prints "NO". This condition is not entirely correct because it only considers specific cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other, but it does not cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

3. **Condition for "YES"**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES". This implies that any other combination of `a` and `b` will allow forming a new rectangle, which is not always true.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
  - Both dimensions are 1, which are odd. Correctly outputs "NO".
- **Test Case 2**: `2 1`
  - One dimension is even, and the other is odd. Correctly outputs "NO".
- **Test Case 3**: `2 6`
  - One dimension is even, and the other is even. Correctly outputs "YES".
- **Test Case 4**: `3 2`
  - Both dimensions are odd. Correctly outputs "NO".
- **Test Case 5**: `2 2`
  - Both dimensions are even, but `a / 2 == b`. Incorrectly outputs "NO" (should output "YES").
- **Test Case 6**: `2 4`
  - One dimension is even, and the other is even. Correctly outputs "YES".
- **Test Case 7**: `6 3`
  - Both dimensions are even. Correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly identifies some cases as "NO" when they should be "YES". Specifically, it fails to recognize that if both dimensions are even and one is not exactly half of the other, a new rectangle can still be formed.

### Correctness:

**False**

The program needs to be revised to handle all valid cases correctly.
