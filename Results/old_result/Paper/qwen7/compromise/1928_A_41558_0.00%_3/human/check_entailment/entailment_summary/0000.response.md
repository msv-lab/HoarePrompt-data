Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two smaller rectangles.
2. The provided program checks two specific conditions:
   - Both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) being odd.
   - One dimension being exactly twice the other.
3. These conditions are sufficient to determine if it's impossible to form a different rectangle:
   - If both dimensions are odd, cutting them will always result in two smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension, which cannot form a different rectangle without rotation.
   - If one dimension is exactly twice the other, the only possible way to cut the rectangle would result in two identical smaller rectangles (e.g., a 4x2 rectangle cut into two 2x2 rectangles), which does not allow forming a different rectangle.
4. All other cases where these conditions do not apply should allow forming a different rectangle, which the program correctly identifies as 'YES'.

Given the logic and the conditions checked, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
