State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `t` must be at least 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.
2. The loop condition `for i in range(t)` implies that the loop will execute `t` times if `t` is at least 1.
3. The variables `a` and `b` are not involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop will execute.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, which must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the final state is: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `t` must be at least 1**.
