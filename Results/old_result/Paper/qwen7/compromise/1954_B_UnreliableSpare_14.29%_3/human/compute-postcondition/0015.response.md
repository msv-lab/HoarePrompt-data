Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` is `False`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `val` is the first element of `arr`.
- `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is initialized and updated based on the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, but no specific values for `arr` or `val` are provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value (which is not specified but could be any non-negative integer) and the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `ans` after it has been updated according to the logic described.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value between its initial value and the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of val in arr)**
