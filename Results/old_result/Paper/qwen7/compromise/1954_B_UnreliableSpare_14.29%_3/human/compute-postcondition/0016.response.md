Postcondition: **`flag` is either `True` or `False`. Regardless of the value of `flag`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.**
