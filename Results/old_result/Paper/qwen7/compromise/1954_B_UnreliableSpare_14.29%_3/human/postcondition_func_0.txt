The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an array `arr` of `n` integers, and an integer `t`. It determines whether all elements in the array `arr` are identical. If they are, it calculates the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the array. If any two consecutive elements differ, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
