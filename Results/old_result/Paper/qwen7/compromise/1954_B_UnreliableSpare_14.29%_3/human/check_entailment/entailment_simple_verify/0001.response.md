### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem defines a "beautiful" array as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already beautiful (all elements are the same).
   - If the array is beautiful, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program uses a flag to check if the array is already beautiful. This is done by comparing adjacent elements.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove by counting the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and using this count to determine the removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array is already beautiful correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of removals has a flaw. The program only considers the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and does not account for other possible sequences that could also make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case and performs the necessary checks and calculations.
   - The use of `Decimal` for `ans` is unnecessary and can be replaced with an integer or float for simplicity.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies whether the array is already beautiful.
   - However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of removals is flawed. The program only considers the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements, which may not be the optimal solution. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The longest sequence of consecutive identical elements is `1`, but removing just one `1` is not sufficient to make the array non-beautiful. Removing the element at index `3` (which is `2`) would make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The logic only considers the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements, which may not be the optimal solution.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
