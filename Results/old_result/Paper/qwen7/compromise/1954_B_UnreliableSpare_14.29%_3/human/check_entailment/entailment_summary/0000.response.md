Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
2. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:
   - The program checks if the array is already a sequence of identical elements and prints `-1` if true. However, this is not the complete solution. It should also consider removing elements to break the beauty condition.
   - The program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove. It finds the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements but does not account for the requirement to break the beauty condition by removing elements.
   - The program does not handle the removal of elements to break the beauty condition effectively. It only checks if the array is already a sequence of identical elements and does not simulate the removal process.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
