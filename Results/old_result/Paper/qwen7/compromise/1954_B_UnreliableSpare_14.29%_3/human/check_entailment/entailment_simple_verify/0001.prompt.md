You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The given array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False

    #State: Output State: `flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop checks if each element in the array `arr` is different from its previous element. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, the final state of `flag` will be `False` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements that are different. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value between its initial value and the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of val in arr)
    #State: `flag` is either `True` or `False`. Regardless of the value of `flag`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem defines a "beautiful" array as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already beautiful (all elements are the same).
   - If the array is beautiful, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program uses a flag to check if the array is already beautiful. This is done by comparing adjacent elements.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove by counting the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and using this count to determine the removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array is already beautiful correctly by printing `-1`.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of removals seems correct, as it finds the longest sequence of identical elements and uses this to determine the necessary removals.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case and performs the necessary checks and calculations.
   - The use of `Decimal` for `ans` is unnecessary and can be replaced with an integer or float for simplicity.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies whether the array is already beautiful.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of removals is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
