Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `x` is 2, `a` is a specific integer appended to `less`, and `x` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `less`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
