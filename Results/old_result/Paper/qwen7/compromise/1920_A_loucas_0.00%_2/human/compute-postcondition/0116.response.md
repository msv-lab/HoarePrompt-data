Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `num = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `num`. All other variables (`i`, `max(big)`, `big`, `no`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
