You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. There are n lines describing constraints, where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
            if i not in no:
                num = i
                break
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `min(less) + (loop * (innerLoop - 1))`, `max(big)` will remain less than `min(less)`, and `num` will be equal to `max(big) + (loop * (innerLoop - 1))`. `big` will be a list containing all integers `a` for which `x == 1` was true across all iterations, `no` will be a list containing all integers `a` for which `x == 3` was true across all iterations, and `less` will be a list containing all integers `a` for which `x == 2` was true across all iterations. The variable `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop` for each iteration, and `x` and `a` will hold the last input values provided by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `innerLoop` will remain unchanged from its initial value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of constraints defined within its scope. It returns a value based on the constraints provided, which include an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) for each test case, and n lines of constraints where each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function ensures there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and all constraints are unique.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
