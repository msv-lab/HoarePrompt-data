Output State: **`less` contains at least one element, `big` contains at least one element, `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)`, and `num` is `max(big)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `less`, `big`, `max(big)`, `min(less)`, or `num`. It only indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)` still holds true.
