Output State: **`iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `no` is a list containing `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is an input integer, `no` becomes a list containing this integer. The values of `iterable2` and `x` remain unchanged.
