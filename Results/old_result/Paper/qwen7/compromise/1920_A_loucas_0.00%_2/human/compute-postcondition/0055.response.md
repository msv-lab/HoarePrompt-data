Based on the initial state provided:

- `less` contains up to three elements.
- `big` contains exactly two elements.
- `no` contains up to one element.
- `iterable` is 1.
- `num` is set to the value of `max(big) + 1` if `max(big) + 1` is not in `no`.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process:

1. `max(big)` will give us the maximum value among the two elements in `big`.
2. `max(big) + 1` will be the next integer after the maximum value in `big`.
3. If `max(big) + 1` is not in `no`, then `num` will be assigned this value.
4. If `max(big) + 1` is in `no`, then `num` will not be assigned this value, but since no other value is specified for `num`, it implies that `num` will retain its default value (which is typically `None` or an undefined state).

Given that the exact contents of `big` and `no` are not specified, we can only describe `num` in terms of the conditions provided. Since `num` is derived from `max(big) + 1` only if it is not in `no`, and without knowing the specific values in `big` and `no`, we cannot determine a concrete numerical value for `num`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the actual values of `big` and `no`, but based on the given information, we can say:

Output: **num (where num is max(big) + 1 if max(big) + 1 is not in no, otherwise undefined)**
