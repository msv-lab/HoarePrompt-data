Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing `[a]`, `num` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `no` was initially an empty list, after appending `a`, `no` becomes a list containing `[a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
