Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Valid Range**:
   - The code attempts to find the maximum value in `big` and the minimum value in `less`, but this approach is flawed. The actual valid range for `k` should be between the maximum lower bound (`max(big)`) and the minimum upper bound (`min(less)`).
   - The current logic only checks for the first integer within this range that is not in `no`, which is not sufficient to cover all valid ranges.

2. **Handling All Constraints**:
   - The code does not account for all constraints properly. For example, if there are multiple constraints of type 1 and type 2, the valid range should be the intersection of all these ranges after removing the values from `no`.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The variable `num` is set to the first valid integer found, but the problem requires calculating the total number of integers in the valid range, not just the first one.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Find the intersection of all lower bounds (from type 1 constraints).
- Find the intersection of all upper bounds (from type 2 constraints).
- Remove the values specified in type 3 constraints.
- Calculate the size of the resulting valid range.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        num_range = []

        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.add(a)

        # Find the maximum lower bound
        max_lower = max(big)
        # Find the minimum upper bound
        min_upper = min(less)

        # Calculate the valid range
        for i in range(max_lower, min_upper + 1):
            if i not in no:
                num_range.append(i)

        print(len(num_range))
```

This corrected function should now accurately compute the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.
