Functionality: **The function processes an input file containing multiple test cases, each consisting of a line of space-separated integers. It skips the first two lines of the file and then, for every second line starting from the third, calculates and prints the count of duplicate integers. The function does not return any value but modifies the state by printing the counts of duplicates for each relevant line. The input file is expected to have a specific structure with `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and each test case contains `n` integers (`1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`), with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice.**
