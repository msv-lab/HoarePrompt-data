Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100.
- `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is updated to the first integer from input.
- `x` is updated to the second integer from input.
- `a` is updated to the third integer from input.
- The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`, and only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
