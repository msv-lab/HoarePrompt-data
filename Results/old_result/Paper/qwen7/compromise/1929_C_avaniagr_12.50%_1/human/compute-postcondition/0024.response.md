Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(x + 1)`.
   
2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `x + 1` is a positive integer.
   - Since `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `x + 1` will always be a positive integer (at least 2).

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `x` is within its valid range, which is \(1 \leq x \leq 100\).
   - The value of `i` will start from 0 and go up to `x`, but since we are only concerned with the initial state, we don't need to specify the exact values of `i` for each iteration.

4. **Consider other relevant variables**:
   - The variables `k`, `a`, `t`, and `z` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `x` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` must be between 1 and 100**
