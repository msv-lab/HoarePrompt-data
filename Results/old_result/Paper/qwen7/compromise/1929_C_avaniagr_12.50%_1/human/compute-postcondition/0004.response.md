Postcondition: `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < k - 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to the first integer from input, `x` is updated to the second integer from input, `a` is updated to the third integer from input.
