Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `x` must be at least 2
   - `z` is updated as `z = z + z // (k - 1) + 1`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x + 1`. Since `i` is now 4, `x` must be at least 5 (because 4 < 5).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `x` must be at least 5.
   - `z` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `x` must be at least 5, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**
