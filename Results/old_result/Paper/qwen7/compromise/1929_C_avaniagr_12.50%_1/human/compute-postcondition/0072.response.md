Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\).
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
- `z` is either 5 or 6 depending on whether `a` is less than 5 or greater than or equal to 5.
- `i` is 3.
- `t` is `t - 1`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` without referencing any of the other variables. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
