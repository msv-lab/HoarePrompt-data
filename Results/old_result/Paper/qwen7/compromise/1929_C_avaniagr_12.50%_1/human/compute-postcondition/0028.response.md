Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` must be between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(x + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` is being incremented from 0 to `x`.
   - The loop condition is `i < x + 1`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and needs to be incremented to 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `z` is not directly affected by the loop itself but by the loop body, which is omitted here. However, since no additional information about `z` or `k` is provided, we assume `z` remains unchanged unless modified inside the loop body.

6. **Final State:**
   - `x` must still be between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `z` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`x` must be between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `z` remains unchanged**.
