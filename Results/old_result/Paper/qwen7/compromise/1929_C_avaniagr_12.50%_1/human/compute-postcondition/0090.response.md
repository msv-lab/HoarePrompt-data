Postcondition: `i` is equal to `x + 1`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `z` is the final value obtained after performing the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x + 1`, and whether `a` is greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z` does not affect the final values of `i` and `z`.
