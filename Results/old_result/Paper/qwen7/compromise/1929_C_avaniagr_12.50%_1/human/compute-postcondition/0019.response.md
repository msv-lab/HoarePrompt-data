Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30.
- `x` is an integer such that 0 <= x <= k - 2.
- `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is updated to the first integer from input.
- `x` is updated to the second integer from input.
- `a` is updated to the third integer from input.

The `print('NO')` statement will print the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
