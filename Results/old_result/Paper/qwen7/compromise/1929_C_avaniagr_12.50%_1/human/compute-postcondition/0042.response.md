Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The variable `t` is not directly affected by this code, so its state remains unchanged except for the condition that it must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`.
