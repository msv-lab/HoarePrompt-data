Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be at least 2, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `z`. However, the initial value of `z` is not provided, and neither is the value of `k`. Therefore, the updated value of `z` is expressed as `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
