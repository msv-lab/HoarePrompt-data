Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func()` correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal based on the given constraints. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win by placing a bet of `1` coin initially and then adjusting his bets based on the outcomes. This ensures he can recover from one loss.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs to ensure he has enough coins to cover a sequence of `x + 2` wins and one loss. This is because after a loss, he can still place a bet of `1` coin again.
   - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs to calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure he can recover from up to `x` consecutive losses. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins back the necessary coins.

2. **Simulation for `x > k - 1`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(x + 1):` calculates the minimum number of coins required (`z`) to recover from `x` consecutive losses. It uses the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` to simulate the recovery process.
   - If Sasha has at least `z` coins, he can guarantee winning regardless of the outcomes.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES' if Sasha can achieve his goal and 'NO' otherwise.

Given these points, the function accurately implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal, making the correctness of the program **True**.
