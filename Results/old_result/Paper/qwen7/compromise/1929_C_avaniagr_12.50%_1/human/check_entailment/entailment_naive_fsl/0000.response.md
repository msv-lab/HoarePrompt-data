Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 3 6`
- Expected Output: `NO`

Here's why the program fails:
- The program checks if `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` separately, but it does not correctly account for the general case where `x > k - 1`.
- For the test case `3 3 6`, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' because it falls into the `else` block where it calculates `z` using the formula `z = 0`. This calculation is incorrect and does not reflect the necessary conditions for Sasha to achieve any number of coins.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to ensure that Sasha can always increase his coins regardless of the number of consecutive losses (`x`). The current implementation does not fully address this requirement, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
