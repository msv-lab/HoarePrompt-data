Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. The logic in the program checks different conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`:
   - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins required to ensure that Sasha can eventually have any number of coins. This calculation is based on the formula derived from the problem statement and the constraints.
4. The program prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.
5. The program resets all relevant variables after processing all test cases.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function appears to be correct. It accurately reflects the conditions specified in the problem statement and provides the correct output for the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
