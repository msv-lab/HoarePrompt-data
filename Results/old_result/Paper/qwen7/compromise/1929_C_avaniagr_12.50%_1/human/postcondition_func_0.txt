The function processes multiple test cases (determined by `t`). For each test case, it reads three integers (`k`, `x`, and `a`) and determines whether a certain condition is met based on these inputs. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function resets all relevant variables to their initial values.
