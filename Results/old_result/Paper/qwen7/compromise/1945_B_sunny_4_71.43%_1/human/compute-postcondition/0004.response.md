Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` within specified ranges (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}), and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function does not take any parameters when called directly but expects these three integers to be provided as part of a test case or input set where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating there could be up to 10,000 such test cases. The function then processes each set of integers `a`, `b`, and `m` and returns a result based on these values.
