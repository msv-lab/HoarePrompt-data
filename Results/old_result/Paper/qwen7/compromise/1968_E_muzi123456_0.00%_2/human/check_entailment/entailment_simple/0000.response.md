Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly reflect the logic required to solve the problem. The key issue is that the program prints the same coordinates `(1, i)` for each test case without considering the requirement to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
2. The program prints `1 1` followed by `1 i` for `i` from 1 to `n`, which means all points are on the same vertical line. This configuration will result in very few unique Manhattan distances, specifically only `n-1` unique distances (since the distance between any two points on the same vertical line is simply the absolute difference of their y-coordinates).
3. The goal is to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances, which requires a more strategic placement of points across the grid.
4. The annotated program incorrectly states that `t` is 1000 and `i` is 3003, which are not relevant to the problem constraints. The actual values of `t` and `n` should be within the specified ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 50 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).

Given these points, the annotated program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
