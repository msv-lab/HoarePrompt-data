Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49.
   - `i` is 1001.
   - `n` is 1000.
3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop continues as long as `t` is non-zero. Since `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, it can be any value in this range. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

Given that `t` is non-zero at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `t` remains non-zero for the next iteration. However, since `t` is an input integer and no operations are performed on `t` within the loop body (as indicated by "the loop body is omit"), `t` will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop.

Since no modifications are made to `t` inside the loop, the only way to ensure the loop can execute one more time is to keep `t` non-zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is still non-zero.

**State Adjustment**:
- `t` must be non-zero.
- `i` will increment to 1002 after the next iteration.
- `n` remains 1000.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be non-zero, `i` is 1002, `n` is 1000**
