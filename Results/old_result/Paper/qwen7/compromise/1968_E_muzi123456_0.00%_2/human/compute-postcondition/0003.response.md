Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive; `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. Since `t` was previously an input integer between 0 and 49, and `n` was an integer between 2 and 1000, these conditions remain true after the code is executed, just with their values updated based on user input.
