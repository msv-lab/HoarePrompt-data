Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 2, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be at least 3.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
