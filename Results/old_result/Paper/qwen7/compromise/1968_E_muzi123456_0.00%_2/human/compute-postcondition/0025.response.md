Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 1001
   - `i` is 1003
   - `n` must be greater than 1001

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1003, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1004.
   - The condition `i < n + 1` must still hold true. Given that `i` is now 1004, `n` must be greater than 1003.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 1004.
   - `n` must be greater than 1003.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is 1001, `i` is 1004, `n` must be greater than 1003**
