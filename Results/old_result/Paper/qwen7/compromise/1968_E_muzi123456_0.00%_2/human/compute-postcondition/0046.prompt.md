Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print('1', end=' ')
        print(i)
    print(' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, `i` is 1001, `n` is 1000.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, and since the loop continues as long as `i <= n`, if the loop executes all 1000 iterations (as `n` is at least 1000), the final value of `i` will be `n + 1 - 1 = 1000`. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` remains unchanged (an integer between 0 and 49), `i` becomes 1001 (since it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, reaching up to but not including `n+1`), and `n` remains 1000 as it was initially set.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `t` is 1001, `i` is 1004 + (n - 3), `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `1001 + n`, because it starts at 1002 and increments by 1 for each iteration. Since `t` remains unchanged at 1001 and the only change in `i` is based on the number of iterations, `i` will be `1001 + n`. The condition for the loop to run is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, as it needs at least 3 iterations to reach the given state after the third iteration.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop will execute `n` times, printing "1" followed by the current value of `i` for each iteration. After all iterations, `t` remains 1000, `i` is `1004 + n`, and `n` is the original input integer.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
