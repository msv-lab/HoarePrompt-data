Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `n + 1` inclusive.

3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `t` is 1000.
   - `i` is `1004 + (n - 3)`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

4. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, n + 1]`.
   - Given `i = 1004 + (n - 3)`, we need to ensure that this value falls within the range `[1, n + 1]`.

5. **Calculate the simplified form of `i`**:
   - Simplify `i`: \( i = 1004 + (n - 3) = 1001 + n \).

6. **Check the range condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `1001 + n` must be between `1` and `n + 1`.
   - This translates to the inequality: \( 1 \leq 1001 + n \leq n + 1 \).

7. **Solve the inequality**:
   - From \( 1 \leq 1001 + n \):
     \[
     1 \leq 1001 + n \implies n \geq -1000
     \]
   - From \( 1001 + n \leq n + 1 \):
     \[
     1001 + n \leq n + 1 \implies 1001 \leq 1
     \]
     This is always false, indicating there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation. Instead, let's directly check if `1001 + n` is within the valid range.

8. **Ensure `1001 + n` is within the valid range**:
   - For the loop to execute, `1001 + n` should be less than or equal to `n + 1`, which simplifies to checking if `1001 + n <= n + 1` is valid. This is always false, so we need to focus on the lower bound.

9. **Final condition**:
   - The critical condition is ensuring `1001 + n` is at least `1`, which means \( n \geq -1000 \). However, since `n` is typically a positive integer in such contexts, we can assume \( n \geq 1 \).

Given these steps, the state adjustments needed are:

- `t` remains as 1000.
- `i` must be `1001 + n`.
- `n` must be at least 1 to ensure `i` is within the valid range.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: `t` is 1000, `i` is 1001 + n, `n` must be at least 1**
