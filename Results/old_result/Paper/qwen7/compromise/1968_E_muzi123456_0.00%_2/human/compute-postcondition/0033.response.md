Output State: **`t` is 1000, `i` is 1004 + (n - 3), `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. Since the initial value of `i` was given as \(1004 + (n - 3)\), after the assignment, `i` will be recalculated based on the new value of `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user.
