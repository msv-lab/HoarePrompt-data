Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last `k // 2` elements are decreased by 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`, `i` is `k // 2 - 1`, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus `k // 2`, `g` is `k // 2`. If `a[d]` equals 0, then `a[d]` remains unchanged. The loop has continued until it reaches the middle of the list `a` or an exception occurred. The condition `k % 2 == 1` is true.**
