Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers where:
  - The first element (`a[0]`) is 2.
  - The second element (`a[1]`) is 1.
  - The third element (`a[2]`) is 3.

The `print('0')` statement simply prints the string `'0'`.

Output: **'0'**
