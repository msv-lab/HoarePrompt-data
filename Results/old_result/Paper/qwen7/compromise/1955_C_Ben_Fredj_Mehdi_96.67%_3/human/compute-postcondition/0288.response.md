Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `z` also remains unchanged. The value of `k` is not directly changed by the code but is defined as the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`, which is now stored in `a` as a list of integers.
