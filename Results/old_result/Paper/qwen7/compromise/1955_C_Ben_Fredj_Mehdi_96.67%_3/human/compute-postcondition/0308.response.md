Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` is 2.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`.

The `print(len(a))` statement will print the length of the list `a`.

Since the exact content of the list `a` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `len(a)`. However, we know it is the length of the list `a`.

Output: **len(a) (where len(a) is the number of elements in the list `a`)**
