Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `a`. If `n` equals 5 and `k` equals 2147483648, then `n` remains 5 and `k` remains 2147483648. Otherwise, `k` is either not 5999999999, not 4294967295, or not 3000000000, and for every even number `i` from 2 to `k // 2`, each element in `a` (except possibly at indices `g` and `d`) is decremented by 1. If an element at index `g` or `d` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1 or `d` is decremented by 1, respectively. The loop breaks if an exception occurs during any iteration. If `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `k` remains unchanged.**
