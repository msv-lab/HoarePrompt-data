Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input. If `n` equals 2, `k` equals 1000000000, and `a` equals `[1000000000, 1000000000]`, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.
