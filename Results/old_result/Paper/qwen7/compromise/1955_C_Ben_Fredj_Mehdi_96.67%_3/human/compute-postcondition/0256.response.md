Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in `a`, then `k` is 0, `d` is the length of `a` minus `k`, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, and `g` is the maximum index where `a[g]` is greater than 0, with `a[g]` being `int(a[g]) - 1` if `k % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `d` is the length of `a`, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, and `a` remains unchanged.**
