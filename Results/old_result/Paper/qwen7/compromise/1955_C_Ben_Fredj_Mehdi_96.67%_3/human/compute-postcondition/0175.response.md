Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `a`, and `k` is the second element of `a`. If `n` is 101 and `k` is 100000000000, then `n` is 101 and `k` is 100000000000. Otherwise, `k` is updated based on specific conditions: if `k` is 10000000000000, `k` remains 1000000000000; if `k` is 99999999999999, `k` is set to 99999999999999; if `k` is 1000000000000, `k` remains 1000000000000; if `k` is an even number, each element in `a` (except possibly at indices `g` and `d`) is decremented by 1, and if an element at index `g` or `d` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1 or `d` is decremented by 1, respectively; if `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1; if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `k` remains unchanged.**
