Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers converted from the input.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input received from the `input()` function.

The `print(len(a))` statement will print the length of the list `a`.

Since the exact input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact length of `a`. However, we know that `a` is a list of integers derived from the input provided by the user.

Output: **len(a) (where len(a) is the number of elements in the list a, which is derived from the input provided by the user)**
