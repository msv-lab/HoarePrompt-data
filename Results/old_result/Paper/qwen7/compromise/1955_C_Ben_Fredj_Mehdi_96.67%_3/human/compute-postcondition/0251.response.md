Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is the length of list `a` minus `k`, `k` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is the maximum index where `a[g]` is greater than 0, and all elements in `a` from index `g` to `d` are 0. The current value of `k` is odd.**
