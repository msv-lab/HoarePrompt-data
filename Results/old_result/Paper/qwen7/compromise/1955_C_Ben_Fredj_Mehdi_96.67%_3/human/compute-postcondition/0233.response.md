Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is `d - 1`, `k` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is 3, `a[d]` is -1, `a[g]` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `d -= 1` decrements the value of `d` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `d` is updated to `d - 1`, while `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, `n`, `g`, `a[d]`, `a[g]`, and `i` retain their original values.
