Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is the length of list `a` minus 1, `k` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is 0, `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`, and the current value of `a[g]` is 0.
