Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is the length of list `a` minus 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input received from `input()` function.**

The code calculates the length of the list `a` and subtracts 1 from it, storing the result in `d`. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
