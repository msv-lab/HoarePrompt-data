Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last element (a[d]) is decreased by 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, and if `a[g]` is 0, the value of `a[g]` remains unchanged. The current value of `a[d]` is 0.
