Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are both digits and letters in the password, and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order. Specifically, the program checks if the digits and letters are sorted separately but does not ensure that the sequence of characters in the password itself adheres to the required conditions. For example, consider the password "123abc". According to the problem description, this password should be "NO" because the digits "123" are not sorted in non-decreasing order relative to the letters "abc". However, the current implementation would incorrectly return "YES" for this password.
