Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes them one by one.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the password string and checks two main conditions:
   - Whether the digits in the password are in non-decreasing order.
   - Whether the letters in the password are in non-decreasing order.
3. The logic for checking these conditions is implemented in the `func_1` function:
   - It separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If any of these checks fail, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - If both checks pass, it returns 'YES'.
4. The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case as specified.
5. The example provided in the execution summary matches the behavior of the program, indicating that the implementation is correct.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
