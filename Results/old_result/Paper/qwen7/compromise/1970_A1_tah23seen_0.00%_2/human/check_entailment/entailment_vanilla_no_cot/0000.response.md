Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the program sorts the keys of the dictionary `d` based on their values (prefix balances) but does not account for the requirement to break ties in decreasing order of position. Additionally, the program does not handle the sorting part correctly as it should sort the characters based on the computed prefix balances and positions, not just the keys of the dictionary.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = []
    balance = 0
    pos = 0
    
    # Compute prefix balances and store them along with positions
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        d.append((balance, pos, i))
        pos += 1
    
    # Sort the list of tuples based on balance and position
    d.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    
    # Construct the balanced shuffle sequence
    for _, _, idx in d:
        ans += s[idx]
    
    return ans

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version properly computes the prefix balances and positions, sorts them according to the specified criteria, and constructs the balanced shuffle sequence accordingly.
