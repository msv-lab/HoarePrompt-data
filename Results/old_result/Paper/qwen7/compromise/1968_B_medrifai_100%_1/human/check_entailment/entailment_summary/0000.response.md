Reasoning:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
3. It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.
4. It initializes three variables: `i` (to track the current position in string `a`), `j` (to track the current position in string `b`), and `c` (to count the matching prefix length).
5. It uses a while loop to iterate through both strings until either the end of one of the strings is reached.
6. Inside the loop, it calls the `func_1` function to find the next character of `a` in the remaining part of `b` starting from index `j`.
7. If the character is found, it updates `j` to the position after the found character and increments both `i` and `c`.
8. If the character is not found, the loop breaks, and the count `c` is printed.

The `func_1` function correctly finds the index of the character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, it returns the correct index; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program should work correctly for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
