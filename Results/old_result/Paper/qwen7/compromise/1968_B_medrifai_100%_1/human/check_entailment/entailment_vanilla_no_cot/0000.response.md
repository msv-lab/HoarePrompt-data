Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, followed by the strings `a` and `b` themselves.
   
2. **Main Loop**: For each test case, it initializes pointers `i` and `j` to traverse through strings `a` and `b`, respectively. It also initializes a counter `c` to keep track of the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Subsequence Check Function (`func_1`)**: This function checks if the current character of `a` starting at position `i` can be found in `b` starting from position `j`. If found, it updates `j` to the next position after the found character and increments both `i` and `c`.

4. **Termination Condition**: The loop breaks if either pointer goes out of bounds, indicating that no further characters of `a` can be matched as a subsequence in `b`.

5. **Output**: After processing each test case, it prints the value of `c`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
