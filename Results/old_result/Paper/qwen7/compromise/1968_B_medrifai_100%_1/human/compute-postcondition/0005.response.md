Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `a` (a binary string), `b` (a binary string), `i` (a non-negative integer representing the current index in string `a`), and `j` (a non-negative integer representing the current index in string `b`). It searches for the character at index `i` in string `a` within the substring of string `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, it returns the index `j` plus the position of the character within the substring of `b`. If the character is not found, it returns -1.**
