Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, but this is just a placeholder and does not affect the state of other variables.
   - The loop itself is controlled by the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`.
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `arr` has at least two elements.
   - `maxi` is still 3.
   - `res` is the input string from the user.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `int(input())` returns a positive integer.
   - Since the loop head does not directly modify `mini`, `i`, `arr`, `maxi`, or `res`, these states remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only thing that changes is the condition for the loop to continue, which depends on the input from the user.
   - Therefore, the state remains the same as the previous iteration, except for the potential change in the loop condition.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `arr` has at least two elements, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is the input string from the user.**
