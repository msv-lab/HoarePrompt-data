Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than `n-1`, so `maxi` must be 1 (since `maxi` is `n-1` and `n` is greater than `n-1`).
   - `res` is either `<` or `=`.
   - `arr` is `[1]` if `res` is `<`, otherwise `arr` is `[0, 1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

   - `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed.
   - `maxi` is 1.
   - `arr[0]` will be 1 if `res` is `<`, and 0 if `res` is `=`.
   - `maxi` is again 1.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Combining the Information:**
   - The string `'?'` will be printed first.
   - Then `maxi` (which is 1) will be printed.
   - Next, `arr[0]` will be printed, which is 1 if `res` is `<`, and 0 if `res` is `=`.
   - `maxi` (which is 1) will be printed again.
   - Finally, `i` (which is 2) will be printed.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? 1 1 1 2'** if `res` is `<`, or **'? 1 0 1 2'** if `res` is `=`.
