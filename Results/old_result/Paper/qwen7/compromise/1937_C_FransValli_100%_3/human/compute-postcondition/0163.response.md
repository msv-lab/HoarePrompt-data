Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed.
- `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.

Since `maxi` is not defined, we cannot provide a precise value for it. Therefore, the output will include the literal string `'?'` followed by `maxi` twice, and `i` twice (which is 1).

Output: **'? ? ? 1 1'**
