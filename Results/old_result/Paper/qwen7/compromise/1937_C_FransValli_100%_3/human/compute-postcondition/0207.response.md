Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than `n-1`, so `maxi` must be a non-negative integer (since `n-1` is a valid integer).
   - `res` is an input string (though it is not used in the print statement).
   - `arr` is either `[1, 3]` or `[2]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`

Given the initial state:
- `maxi` is `n-1`, where `n` is greater than `n-1`, but since `n-1` is a specific integer, let's denote it as `k` (where `k` is a non-negative integer). So, `maxi = k`.
- `arr` can be either `[1, 3]` or `[2]`, so `arr[0]` will be either `1` or `2`.

Since `i` is explicitly given as `3`, we can directly use this value.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a question mark)
- The value of `maxi` (which is `k`)
- The first element of `arr` (either `1` or `2`)
- The value of `maxi` again (which is `k`)
- The value of `i` (which is `3`)

Therefore, the output will be one of the following two possibilities:
- If `arr` is `[1, 3]`, the output will be: `? k 1 k 3`
- If `arr` is `[2]`, the output will be: `? k 2 k 3`

Since the exact value of `k` (i.e., `maxi`) is not specified, we represent it as `k`.

Output: **? k 1 k 3** or **? k 2 k 3**
