Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 10 (though this is not directly used in the print statement).
- `i` is less than `n` (the value of `n` is not specified, but it doesn't affect the print statement directly).
- `arr` is a list containing either 0 and `i + 1` or just `i + 1`. Since `i` is less than `n`, and no specific value for `i` is given, we consider the general case where `arr` contains `i + 1`.
- `maxi` is 3.
- `res` is an input string which is either equal to '<' or '=' (though this is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Given the conditions:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is explicitly given as 3.
- `arr[0]` will be `i + 1` because `arr` contains `i + 1` (and possibly 0, but since `i` is less than `n`, `arr[0]` will definitely be `i + 1`).
- `maxi` is again 3.
- `i` is less than `n`, but its exact value is not specified, so we keep it as `i`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? 3 i + 1 3 i'**
