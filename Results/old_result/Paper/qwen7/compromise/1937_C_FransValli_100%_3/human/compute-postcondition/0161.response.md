Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `mini` will hold the minimum value found in the array after comparing each element with the current `mini`, `maxi` remains 0, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The line `maxi = 0` sets the variable `maxi` to 0. All other variables (`mini`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `arr` must have at least `len(arr) + 1` elements also remains valid.
