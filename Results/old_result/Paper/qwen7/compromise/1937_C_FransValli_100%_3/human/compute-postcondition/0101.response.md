Output State: `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to 0, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `res` is an input string from the user.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After each iteration, `i` decreases by 1. Therefore, after `n-1` iterations, `i` will become 0. During these iterations, `maxi` is updated to `i` whenever `res` is '<'. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches 0, `maxi` will be set to `n-1` when `res` is '<' at least once during the loop. If `res` is never '<', `maxi` would still be 0, but based on the given states, it is clear that `maxi` is updated to `i` which eventually becomes `n-1`. The other variables (`mini` and `res`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
