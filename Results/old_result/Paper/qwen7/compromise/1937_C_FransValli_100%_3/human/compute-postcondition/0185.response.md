Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `maxi` is set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than `n-1`, but since `n` is not explicitly given, we know it's a value such that `n > n-1` (which is always true for any positive integer).
   - `res` is an input string which is not `<`.
   - `arr` is a list containing a single element, which is 0 (`arr = [0]`).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `'?'` is a literal string.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `arr[0]` is the first element of the list `arr`, which is 0.
   - `maxi` again is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`.

Output: **'? n-1 0 n-1 1'**
