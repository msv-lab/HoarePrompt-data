Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing `[i + 1, i]`, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains either `[i + 1]` or `[i + 1, i + 2]`. After appending `i`, if `arr` initially contained `[i + 1]`, it now becomes `[i + 1, i]`. The values of `total`, `n`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged.
