Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxi` is explicitly given as 2.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not needed for the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 3, but its value is not needed for the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

This will print a string with the following values:
- The literal character `'?'`
- The value of `maxi`, which is 2
- The value of `maxi` again, which is 2
- The value of `i`, which is 3
- The value of `i` again, which is 3

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? 2 2 3 3'**
