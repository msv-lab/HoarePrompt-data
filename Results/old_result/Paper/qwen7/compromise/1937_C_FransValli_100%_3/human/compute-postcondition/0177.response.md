Output: **? maxi maxi 3 3** 

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- The variable `n` is mentioned to be greater than 3, but its exact value is not specified. However, since `maxi` is not defined anywhere in the initial state and there's no context suggesting its value, we cannot determine its value precisely. Therefore, `maxi` remains as it is in the print statement.
- The `print` statement includes the string `'?'`, followed by `maxi`, `maxi`, `i`, and `i`. Since `i` is 3, the print statement will output `3` twice.
- The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is flushed immediately, but it does not affect what is printed.
