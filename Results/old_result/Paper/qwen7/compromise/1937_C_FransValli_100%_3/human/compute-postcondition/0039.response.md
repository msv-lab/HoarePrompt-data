Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing either 0 and `i + 1` or just `i + 1`, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string which is either equal to '<' or '=' and `res` is an input from the user.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value of the input from the user. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `res` depends on the user's input, which can be either '<' or '='.
