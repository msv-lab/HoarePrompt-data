Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that the loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the integer input provided by the user. Let's denote this integer input as `k`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will run `k` times.

3. **Variables Involved**: The variables involved in the loop head are:
   - `_`: A dummy variable used to iterate over the range.
   - No other variables are directly modified or checked within the loop head.

4. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop head does not involve any specific variables that change within the loop itself (other than the dummy variable `_`), no state adjustments are needed for these variables. The only thing that changes is the number of iterations remaining.

5. **Iteration Count**: The loop will decrement the number of iterations by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, if the loop has just completed an iteration, the number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- The number of remaining iterations is `k - 1`.

Since no other variables are modified in the loop head, the states of `arr`, `mini`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `arr` must have at least `len(arr)` elements, with each element of `arr` being checked exactly once starting from the second element, `mini` will hold the minimum value among all elements of `arr` that was updated whenever `res` was '>' during the loop iterations, the variable `i` remains unchanged as it was initialized to `n` (which is not further modified within the loop) and `maxi` remains 0 throughout the loop, and the number of remaining iterations is `k - 1`.**

To summarize, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `arr` must have at least `len(arr)` elements, with each element of `arr` being checked exactly once starting from the second element, `mini` will hold the minimum value among all elements of `arr` that was updated whenever `res` was '>' during the loop iterations, the variable `i` remains unchanged as it was initialized to `n` (which is not further modified within the loop) and `maxi` remains 0 throughout the loop, and the number of remaining iterations is `k - 1`.**
