Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is set to `arr[0]`, which means `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`.
- `i` is set to `n`, which is a value greater than `n-1` (since `n` is greater than `n-1`).
- `maxi` is set to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `arr` since it contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '='.
- `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- `item` is set to `arr[1]`, which means `item` is the second element of the list `arr`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`, which is `0`.
- The second `mini` is also `0`.
- `item` is the second element of the list `arr`, which is `1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 0 0 1 1'**
