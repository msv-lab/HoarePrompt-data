Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `item` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of `arr` (index 1) and goes until the end.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is `item`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '='.
   - `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `item` is `arr[2]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, the next `item` will be the next element in `arr` after the current one.
   - The current `item` is `arr[2]`, so the next `item` will be `arr[3]`.
   - The array `arr` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, `arr` stays as it is.
   - The value of `mini` becomes the current `item` in each iteration, so after the next iteration, `mini` will be `arr[3]`.
   - The variable `i` and `maxi` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.
   - The variable `res` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `item`, which will be `arr[3]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mini` is `arr[3]`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '=', `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, `item` is `arr[3]`**.
