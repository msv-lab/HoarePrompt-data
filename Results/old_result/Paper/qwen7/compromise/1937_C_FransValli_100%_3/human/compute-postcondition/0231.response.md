Output State: **`mini` is `arr[3]`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `item` is `arr[3]`**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `res`. The other variables (`mini`, `i`, `maxi`, `item`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `res` after this operation is an input string provided by the user.
