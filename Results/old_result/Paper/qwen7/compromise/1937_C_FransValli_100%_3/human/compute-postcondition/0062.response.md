Output State: **`mini` is equal to `item`, `i` will be less than `n`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is '>'**.

Explanation: The line `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` to the variable `mini`. All other variables (`i`, `arr`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
