Functionality: **The function interacts with an external system to process multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it queries indices and compares bitwise OR results to determine the maximum and minimum values that form the maximum XOR pair. Finally, it outputs the result for each test case, consisting of the maximum and minimum values that yield the highest XOR result.**
