Postcondition: `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `maxi` is `i`, `res` is the new input string from the user, and `n` must be greater than 1. If the current value of `res` is '<', then `mini` remains unchanged, `i` is decremented by 1, `maxi` is set to `i`, and `res` is updated to the new input string.
