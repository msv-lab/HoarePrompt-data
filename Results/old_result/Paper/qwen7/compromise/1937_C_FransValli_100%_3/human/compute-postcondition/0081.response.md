Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is the input string from the user, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`mini`, `i`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
