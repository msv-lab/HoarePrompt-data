Output State: **`i` is 3, `maxi` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `arr` is `[1, 3]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is either `[1]` or `[0, 1]` depending on the value of `res`. Since `i` is 3 now, `arr` becomes `[1, 3]` or `[0, 1, 3]` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
