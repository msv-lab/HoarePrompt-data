Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` will be equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the selected elements from both halves of the array (`b` and `c`) will result in the same XOR value. Hereâ€™s a counterexample to illustrate this:

Consider the input:
```
4 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

The program's output for this input is:
```
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```

Let's calculate the XOR values:
- XOR of `l`: \(5 \oplus 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 = 2\)
- XOR of `r`: \(6 \oplus 4 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 8\)

Clearly, the XOR values do not match, which violates the requirement that the XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
