Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans2` contains all elements that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1) in pairs, and `ans1` now includes the element `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the value of `l[i]` to the list `ans1`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
