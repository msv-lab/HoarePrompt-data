Output State: **`k` is either 0 or -2, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and `ans2` remains unchanged.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `k`, `i`, `n`, or `ans2`. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement, which is not present in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
