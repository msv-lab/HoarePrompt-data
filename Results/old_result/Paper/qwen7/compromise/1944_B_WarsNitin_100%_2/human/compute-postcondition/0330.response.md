Postcondition: `k` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and if `c[3]` is equal to `c[2]`, then `k` remains 0, `i` remains 3, `n` remains greater than 1, and `ans2` contains the elements `[c[3], c[3]]`. If `c[3]` is not equal to `c[2]`, then no changes occur to `k`, `i`, `n`, and `ans2` remains unchanged.
