Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is adjusted according to the condition of `b[n-2]` and `b[n-1]`. If `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`, `k` remains twice the original value of `k`. If `b[n-2]` is equal to `b[n-1]`, `k` is `k` minus 2. `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is a list containing the first element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the first and last elements of `b` if `b[n-2]` equals `b[n-1]`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`.**
