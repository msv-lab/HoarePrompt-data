Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans1` includes the elements at indices 0 and 2 of `l` and appends the element at index 2 of `l`; `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l` and the element at index `i` of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 2, `ans2` now includes the element at index 1 of `l` and the element at index 2 of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
