Postcondition: **`b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is sorted, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either 2 times the original value of `k` or 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2), `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the element `b[n-1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is the original value of `k`, and `l` is a list containing `[b[n-1]]` if `b[n-2] != b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
