Output State: **`k` is 0 and `i` is 1; `ans1` has appended `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 1, `b[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `b`. However, the initial state does not specify the contents of `b`, so we only know that `ans1` now includes the element `b[1]`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
