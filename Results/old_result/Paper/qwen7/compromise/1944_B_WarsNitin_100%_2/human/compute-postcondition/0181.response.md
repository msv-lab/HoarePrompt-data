Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans1` is a list containing the element at index 3 of `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 3, `ans1` now contains the element at index 3 of `b`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
