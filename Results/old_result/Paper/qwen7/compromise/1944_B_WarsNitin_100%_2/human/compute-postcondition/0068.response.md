Output State: **`k` is `req`, `i` is 0, `ans1` contains all elements that met the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1), and `l` is a list containing the first and last elements of `b` if `b[n-2]` equals `b[n-1]`, otherwise it is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `k = req` simply assigns the value of `req` to the variable `k`. The values of `i`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
