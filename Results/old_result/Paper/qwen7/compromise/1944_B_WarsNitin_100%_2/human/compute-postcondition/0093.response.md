Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` appended to it if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2` if the condition `k == 0` is true and the element `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. Since `k` is 0, the condition `k == 0` is true, and the list `ans2` will contain the element `c[i]` appended to it if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged, and `i` is still `i_prev + 2`.
