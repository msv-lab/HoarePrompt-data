Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is adjusted according to the condition of `b[n-2]` and `b[n-1]`. If `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`, `k` remains twice the original value of `k`. If `b[n-2]` is equal to `b[n-1]`, `k` is `k` minus 2. `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is a list containing the first element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the first and last elements of `b` if `b[n-2]` equals `b[n-1]`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2 and `ans1` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `k` remains 0, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `l` contains the value of `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is 0 and `i` is `n-1`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `i` is decremented by 1. In both cases, `k` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is 0 and `i` is 1. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2 and `i` is 1, and `ans1` contains the element `b[1]` appended to it. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, then the values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
