Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input, converts each element into an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
