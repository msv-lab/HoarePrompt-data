Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements with the first two elements being equal, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is a list containing the first element of `b` followed by `b[n - 1]` with the last element appended, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element `b[n - 1]` to the list `ans1`. Since `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements with the first two elements being equal, and `ans1` initially contains the first element of `b` followed by `b[n - 1]`, after appending, `ans1` now contains the first element of `b` followed by `b[n - 1]` with the last element (`b[n - 1]`) appended again. All other variables remain unchanged.
