Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements with the first two elements being unequal, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is a list containing the first element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` and the last element of `b` (which is now `b[n-1]`).**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of the sublist `b` (which is `b[n-1]`) to the list `l`. Since `b` was previously defined as containing the first `n` sorted elements of `a` with the first two elements being unequal, appending `b[n-1]` means `l` now contains the first element of `b` and the last element of `b`.
