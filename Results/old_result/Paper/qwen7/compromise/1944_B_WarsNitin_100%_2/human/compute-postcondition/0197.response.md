Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing the current value of `c[i]`.**

The code appends the current value of `c[i]` to `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `c[i]` refers to `c[2]`. Since no specific value for `c[2]` is provided, `c[2]` retains its original value, which is implied to be the same as `c[1]` (as per the initial condition stating `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `c[i-1]`). Therefore, `ans2` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
