Output State: **`k` is -3, `i` is `n + 2`, `ans2` includes the pair of elements `l[i]` and the previous element that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, and `ans1` includes the element `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from -2 to -3. The values of `i`, `ans2`, and `ans1` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
