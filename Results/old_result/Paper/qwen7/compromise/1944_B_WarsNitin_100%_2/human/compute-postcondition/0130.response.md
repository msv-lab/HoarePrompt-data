Output State: **`b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` contains the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b`, which originally contained the first `n` elements of `a`. The sorting operation modifies `b` in place, leaving `a`, `n`, and `k` unchanged. Therefore, `b` now contains the first `n` elements of `a` in sorted order, while `c` still contains the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.
