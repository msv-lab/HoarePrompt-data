Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans1` includes the element at index 0 of `l`; `ans1` is updated by appending the element at index 2 of `l`; `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans1` will include the element at index 0 of `l` (as per the initial state) and also append the element at index 2 of `l`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `ans2` still includes the element at index 1 of `l`.
