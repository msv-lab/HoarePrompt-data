Output State: **`i` is 1, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans1` contains the element `l[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, `ans1` now includes `l[1]`. The conditions for `k` and the loop remain unchanged.
