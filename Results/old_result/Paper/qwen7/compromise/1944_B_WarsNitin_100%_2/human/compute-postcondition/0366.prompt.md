Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `k` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and `ans2` contains a list of elements where each element appears twice, provided they are consecutive in the original list `c`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The loop breaks when `k` reaches 0 or becomes negative. Since `k` starts as `req` (which is equal to `c[0]`), and each iteration reduces `k` by 2 if `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`, `k` will eventually become 0 or less. The list `ans2` will contain pairs of consecutive equal elements from the list `c`, starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, unless `k` becomes 0 before reaching the end of the list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0; `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l`; `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0; `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l` appended with the element at index 1 of `l`; `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l` appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `k` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans1` contains the element `l[1]`, `ans2` contains the element `l[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
