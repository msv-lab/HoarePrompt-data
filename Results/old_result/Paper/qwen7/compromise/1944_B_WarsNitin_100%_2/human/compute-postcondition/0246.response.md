Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `ans1` includes the elements at indices 0 to `n-3` of `l`
- `ans2` includes the elements at indices 1 to `n-2` of `l` twice each

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(*ans2)` executes.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `ans2`:**
   - `ans2` contains the elements from indices 1 to `n-2` of `l`, but each element appears twice.
   - If `l` is a list with `n` elements, then `ans2` will contain the elements `l[1]` to `l[n-2]`, each appearing twice.

2. **Printing `ans2`:**
   - The `*` operator in front of `ans2` unpacks the list, so `print(*ans2)` will print each element of `ans2` on the same line, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be the elements from `l[1]` to `l[n-2]`, each repeated twice, printed on a single line.

Output: **l[1] l[1] l[2] l[2] ... l[n-3] l[n-3] l[n-2] l[n-2]**
