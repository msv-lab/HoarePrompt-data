Based on the initial state and the explanation provided:

- `k` is set to `-n` after the loop has executed `n` times.
- `i` is set to `2 * n - 1` after the loop has executed `n` times.
- `ans1` accumulates all elements from `l` up to the point where the loop terminated.
- `ans2` accumulates all pairs of consecutive elements from `l` that meet the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]`.

Given these details, the `print(*ans1)` statement will print all elements from `l` that were accumulated during the loop execution.

Output: **all elements from l**
