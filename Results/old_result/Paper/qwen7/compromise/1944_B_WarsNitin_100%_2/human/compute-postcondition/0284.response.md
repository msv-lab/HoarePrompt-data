Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is equal to 0, and either `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is added to list `l` and `b[i + 1]` (which is `b[2]`) is not equal to `b[i]`, or `i` is 2, `b[i]` (which is `b[2]`) is equal to `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[1]`), and `ans1` contains the elements `b[1]` and `b[2]`.
