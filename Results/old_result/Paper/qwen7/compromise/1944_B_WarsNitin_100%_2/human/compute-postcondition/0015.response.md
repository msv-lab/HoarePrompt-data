Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements with the first two elements being unequal, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`, `b` and `c` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the first element of `b` to the list `l`. Since `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements with the first two elements being unequal, appending the first element of `b` to `l` does not affect the other variables. The value of `l` changes to contain the first element of `b`.
