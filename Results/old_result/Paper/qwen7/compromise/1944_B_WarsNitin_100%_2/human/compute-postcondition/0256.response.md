Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `t`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the elements from index `n` to the end of `a`, `c` is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `k` by 2, changing its value to twice the original value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
