Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k` minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements with the first two elements being equal, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is a list containing the first element of `b` followed by `b[n - 1]` with the last element appended, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= 2` decreases the value of `k` by 2. Since `k` was originally twice its original value, it is now twice the original value minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
