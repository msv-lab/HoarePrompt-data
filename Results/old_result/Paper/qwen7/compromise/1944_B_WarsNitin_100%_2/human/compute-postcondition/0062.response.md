Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 1, `l` is a list with the element `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 1, `b[i]` is `b[1]`. Since `k` is 0, the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is met, and thus `k` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` now contains the element `b[1]`.
