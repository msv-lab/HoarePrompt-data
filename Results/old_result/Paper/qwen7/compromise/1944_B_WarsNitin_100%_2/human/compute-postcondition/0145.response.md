Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range specified as `range(1, n - 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 1 until `i < n - 1`, the initial value of `i` must be 1 for the loop to start executing.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`b`, `c`, `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l`) do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information. They remain in their current states.

Given these points, we can summarize the required adjustments:

**State:**
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
