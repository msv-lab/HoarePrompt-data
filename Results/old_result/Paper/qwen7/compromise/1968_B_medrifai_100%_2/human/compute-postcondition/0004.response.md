Output State: **The program returns -1**

The code simply returns the value `-1` without any conditions or further calculations. Given the initial state where `index` is `-1`, `a` and `b` are binary strings, and `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing current indices in strings `a` and `b`, the return statement directly provides the value `-1`.
