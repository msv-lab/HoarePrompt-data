Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `x + 2`.
   - `x` is an integer entered by the user.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `x` is a non-negative integer (since `range(x)` generates numbers from 0 to `x-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `x + 2`, its value is dependent on `x`. However, the loop itself does not depend on `i` directly; it depends on `x`.
   - The variable `s` is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `k` is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `x` and `i`.

State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is x + 2, x must be a non-negative integer**
