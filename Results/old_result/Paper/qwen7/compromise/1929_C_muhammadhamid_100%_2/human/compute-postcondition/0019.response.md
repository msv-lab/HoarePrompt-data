Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - `k` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `x` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `i` is initially set to `x + 1`.
   - `s` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1` plus 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Determine the changes at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, if the loop just finished its previous iteration, `i` would be `x + 2`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - Since `i` is now `x + 2`, it is not less than `x`, so the loop will not execute again unless `x` is adjusted.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `x + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `x` must be at least `x + 3` (since `i` needs to be less than `x`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer that must be at least x + 3, `i` is x + 2, `s` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `s` by k-1 plus 1**
