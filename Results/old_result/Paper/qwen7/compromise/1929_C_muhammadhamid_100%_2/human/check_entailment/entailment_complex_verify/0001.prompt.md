You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `k` retains its final value as determined by the loop's conditions, `x` also retains its final value as determined by the loop's conditions, and `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `i` is set to `x + 1` because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`, making `i` equal to `x` after all iterations. The variable `s` is updated through the loop to include the sum of `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`. Given the operations `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` starting from `s = 1`, `s` will be the sum of 1 plus the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration, which ultimately results in `s` being `x + 1`.
    #
    #To summarize, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:
    #- `k`: The integer value entered by the user.
    #- `x`: The integer value entered by the user.
    #- `a`: The integer value entered by the user, unchanged.
    #- `i`: Equal to `x`.
    #- `s`: The sum of 1 plus the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`, resulting in `s = x + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). For each input, it calculates a value \( s \) starting from 1 and updating it through a loop where \( s \) is incremented by \( s // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x \) iterations. After the loop, it prints 'Yes' if \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( s \), otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 1. This variable is intended to represent the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can achieve any number of coins `n`.

3. **Loop Calculation**:
   - A loop runs from `0` to `x-1` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - `s // (k - 1)` calculates how many times the current value of `s` can be divided by `(k - 1)`.
     - Adding 1 to this result means adding one more unit to the sum.
     - This operation essentially simulates the growth of Sasha's coins based on the betting strategy.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Reasoning

The key idea here is to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n` starting from `a` coins, given the constraints on the number of consecutive losses (`x`) and the multiplier `k`.

#### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Strategy Validity**:
   - The strategy used in the loop seems to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins assuming he wins every bet after a loss. However, this might not cover all possible sequences of wins and losses.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is a simplified way to estimate the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee winning any number of coins. It assumes Sasha always wins after a loss, which might not be accurate for all scenarios.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the initial number of coins `a` is too small compared to the calculated `s`.

### Conclusion

Upon closer inspection, the program does not correctly simulate all possible sequences of wins and losses. Specifically, it assumes Sasha always wins after a loss, which might not be the case. The program might fail for certain inputs where Sasha cannot guarantee winning any number of coins due to the constraints on consecutive losses.

Therefore, the given program is **not correct**.
