Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates `s` based on the number of consecutive losses (`x`) but does not account for the actual betting and winning/losing process. 

To illustrate, let's consider the first test case from the example input: `2 1 7`. According to the problem description, Sasha can achieve any number of coins by placing bets strategically. However, the program's logic does not reflect this. Instead, it calculates `s` as follows:

```python
s = 1
for i in range(x):
    s += s // (k - 1) + 1
```

This calculation does not simulate the actual betting and winning/losing process. For instance, with `k=2`, `x=1`, and `a=7`, the program calculates `s` as:

```python
s = 1
s += 1 // 1 + 1  # s becomes 3
```

So, `s` is 3, and the program prints "Yes" because `a >= s`. However, this does not reflect the actual strategy needed to ensure Sasha can achieve any number of coins. The correct strategy involves placing bets based on the outcomes of previous bets, which the program does not implement.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case, leading to a false result.
