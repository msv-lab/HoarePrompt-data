Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. Since `ans` was previously updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, setting `cnt` to 0 means `ans` will remain unchanged (as 0 is the minimum value it can take). The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while `n`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
