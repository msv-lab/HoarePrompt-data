Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This updates the value of `cnt` from its previous state, which was either 1 (if `a[0] == tmp`) or 0 (if `a[0] != tmp`). Now, `cnt` is explicitly set to 0. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `n`) remain in their previous states.
