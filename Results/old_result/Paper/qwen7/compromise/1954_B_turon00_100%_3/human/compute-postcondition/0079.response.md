Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` remains unchanged, meaning its value before the loop starts is irrelevant for the loop condition.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Initial values before the loop**:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `ans` is `n`.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `i` remains unchanged (its initial value is irrelevant).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `tmp` is `a[0]`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting point) and `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
