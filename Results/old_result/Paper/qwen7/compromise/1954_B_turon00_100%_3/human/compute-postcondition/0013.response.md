Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (`ans`) and the value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` is 0 initially, `ans` will remain equal to `n` because `n` is specified to be greater than 0 and initially equal to `ans`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.
