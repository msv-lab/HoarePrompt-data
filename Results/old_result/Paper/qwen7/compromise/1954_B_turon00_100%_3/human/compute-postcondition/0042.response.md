Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input; `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`; `cnt` is 0; either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`; `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`; `_` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `tmp` has been updated to the first element of the list `a`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
