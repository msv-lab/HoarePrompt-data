Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list (i + 1), `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans`) remain in their original conditions relative to each other, but `cnt` is now one more than its previous value.
