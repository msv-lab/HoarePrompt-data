Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
