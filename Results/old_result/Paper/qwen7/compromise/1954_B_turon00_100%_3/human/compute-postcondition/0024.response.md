Output State: **`cnt` is updated by adding 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.**

This means that the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, and `i` has also been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states. The `ans` variable now holds the minimum value between its previous value and the new value of `cnt`.
