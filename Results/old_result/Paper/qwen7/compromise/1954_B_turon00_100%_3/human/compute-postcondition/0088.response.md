Output State: **`cnt` is either 2 (if `a[0] == tmp`) or 1 (if `a[0] != tmp`).**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `a[0] == tmp`, then `cnt` was initially 1, and now it becomes 2. If `a[0] != tmp`, then `cnt` was initially 0, and now it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
