Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found during the loop, `cnt` is 0, and `n` and `tmp` retain their original values.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have incremented to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `ans` will hold the minimum count of consecutive elements that were equal to `tmp` encountered during the loop's execution. The variable `cnt` will be reset to 0 at the end of the loop since it is set to 0 whenever `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`. The values of `n` and `tmp` do not change as they are not modified within the loop.
