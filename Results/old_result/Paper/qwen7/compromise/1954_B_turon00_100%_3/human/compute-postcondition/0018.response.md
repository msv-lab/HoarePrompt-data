Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `a` is the same, `tmp` is the same, and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, cnt)` if `a[i]` did not equal `tmp`, otherwise `ans` remains `n`.**

This means that `cnt` has been incremented by 1, while `i` is now `i + 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states, unless `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`, in which case `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
