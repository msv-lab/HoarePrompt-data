Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `cnt` is set to 0, while `n`, `a`, and `tmp` retain their original values.
