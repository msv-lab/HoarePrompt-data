Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. Since `n` is an input integer, `ans` will also be that same integer. The other variables (`cnt`, `a`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
