Output State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is 1**

The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (since it's not defined in the initial state, we assume it to be 0 for calculation purposes). Given that `i` remains unchanged, its value stays at 2. Since `n` must be greater than 0 and no operation involving `n` is performed, the condition on `n` remains valid.
