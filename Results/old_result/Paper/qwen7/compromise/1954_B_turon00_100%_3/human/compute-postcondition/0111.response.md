Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then finds the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements in the array `a`. If `n` is 1 or the minimum length is equal to `n`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the minimum length. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
