Output State: **`t` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `tmp` is `a[0]`**.

This means that the variable `tmp` is now assigned the value of the first element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
