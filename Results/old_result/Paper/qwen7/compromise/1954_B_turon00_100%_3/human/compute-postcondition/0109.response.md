Output State: `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the entire loop execution, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains the same as the initial input, `a` remains the same list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, and `cnt` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. If `n == 1` or `ans == n`, then the condition `print(-1)` will be executed. Otherwise, `print(ans)` will be executed, where `ans` is the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements found in the list `a`.
