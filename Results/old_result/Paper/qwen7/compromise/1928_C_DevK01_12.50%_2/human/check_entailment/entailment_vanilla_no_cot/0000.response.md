Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, the logic inside the function is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:` is unnecessary and incorrect. Also, the loop for finding divisors should start from `x - 1` instead of `1`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the program tries to calculate the possible values of `k` using the function `func_1`. However, the approach to calculating the possible values of `k` is incorrect. The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but the subsequent logic to determine the possible values of `k` is not correctly implemented.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is very close to `3 * x - 2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        y //= 2
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            ans += len([i for i in range(x-1, y+1) if y % i == 0])
        ans += len([i for i in range(x-1, (n-x)//2 + 1) if (n-x) % i == 0])
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version directly calculates the possible values of `k` without relying on the incorrect `func_1` function. It iterates through the possible values of `k` and checks if they satisfy the conditions.
