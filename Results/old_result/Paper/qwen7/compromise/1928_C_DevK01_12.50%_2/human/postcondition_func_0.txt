The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` represents the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 100. For each test case, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The function calculates the integer part of the square root of `q` and checks if it meets certain conditions. If these conditions are satisfied, it adds the integer part of the square root or its divisors to the list `M`. Finally, the function returns an empty list `M`.
