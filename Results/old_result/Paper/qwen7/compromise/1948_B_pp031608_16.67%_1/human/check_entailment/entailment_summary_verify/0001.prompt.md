You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers (where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the list length is between 2 and 50) and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order or not.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Initial Analysis**: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and applying the specified operation to elements that are greater than or equal to 10. However, the implementation of the operation within the loop is flawed.

2. **Flawed Operation Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called with the updated list inside the loop.
   - The logic to split an element into its digits and insert them back into the list is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the code snippet `a = list1[p - 1]; list1.pop(p - 1); list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10); list1.insert(p, a % 10)` does not correctly handle the splitting of the number into digits.
   - The operation should split the number into its digits and insert them back into the list, but the current implementation only splits the number and inserts the quotient and remainder separately, which is incorrect.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The operation needs to be applied iteratively until no more operations can be performed or the array is sorted.
   - A helper function should be used to perform the digit splitting and insertion.
   - After each operation, check if the array is sorted. If it is, break the loop and return `Yes`. If not, continue the process.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the digit splitting and insertion.
   - The `func_1` function is not used effectively to check if the array is sorted after each operation.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the digit splitting and insertion logic.

Correctness: **False**
