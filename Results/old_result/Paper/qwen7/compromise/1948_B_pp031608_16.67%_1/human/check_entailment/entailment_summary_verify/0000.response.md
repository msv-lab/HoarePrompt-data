### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness.

#### Provided Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`list1`).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If `func_1(list1)` returns `False`, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - However, the function is not defined in the provided code, which means the program will raise a `NameError` when it tries to call `func_1`.

#### Function Summary Analysis

- The function `func_1` is supposed to return a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order.
- The function is not defined in the provided code, which is a significant issue.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`**:
   - The program calls `func_1` but does not define it, leading to a runtime error.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Numbers**:
   - The logic for splitting numbers and inserting digits back into the list is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.

3. **Incorrect Loop Condition and Logic**:
   - The loop condition and logic inside the loop do not correctly check and modify the list to ensure it becomes sorted. The program does not properly handle the insertion of digits and the sorting process.

#### Example Test Cases

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - The program should split the elements to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `[12, 28, 5]`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - The program should not be able to sort this list using the allowed operations.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `[0, 0]`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - The list is already sorted.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, and the function `func_1` is not defined, leading to a runtime error.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the undefined function `func_1` and the flawed logic for splitting and reinserting digits.
