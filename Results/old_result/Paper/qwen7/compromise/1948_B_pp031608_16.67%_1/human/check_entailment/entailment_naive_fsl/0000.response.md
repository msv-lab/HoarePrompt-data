Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the splitting of numbers that are at least 10 properly. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, and the logic inside the main loop is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is undefined**: The program calls `func_1` but does not define it. This would result in a runtime error.

2. **Incorrect logic for splitting numbers**: The program attempts to split numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the list. However, the logic for this is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.

3. **Incorrect loop condition and logic**: The loop condition and logic inside the loop do not correctly check and modify the list to ensure it becomes sorted. The program does not properly handle the insertion of digits and the sorting process.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output for the first and second test cases. Hereâ€™s why:

- **First Test Case**: The input `[12, 3, 45, 67]` should become `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` after splitting, which is sorted.
- **Second Test Case**: The input `[12, 28, 5]` cannot be made sorted using the allowed operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
