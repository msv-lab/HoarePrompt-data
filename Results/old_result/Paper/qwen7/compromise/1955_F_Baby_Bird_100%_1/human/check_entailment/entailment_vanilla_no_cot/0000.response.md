Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used in the program does not accurately determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to analyze the bitwise XOR of the sequence and how removing elements affects it. Specifically, we need to count the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s and use this information to determine the optimal moves for Bob to ensure he wins as many times as possible. The current implementation does not reflect this logic.
