You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each defined by four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts using a specific formula, then divides the result by 3 and prints the outcome. The function processes up to 10,000 test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
2. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero. Otherwise, Bob wins.
3. **Sequence Composition**: Each test case starts with a sequence of `p_1` ones, `p_2` twos, `p_3` threes, and `p_4` fours.
4. **Optimal Strategy**: Eve removes numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the sum function: `(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3))`
     - `x // 2`: Integer division by 2.
     - `x % 2`: Modulo operation to get the remainder when divided by 2.
     - `i < 3`: Checks if the index is less than 3 (i.e., for ones, twos, and threes).
   - The result of this expression is summed up for each count of numbers (ones, twos, threes, fours).

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The sum is then divided by 3 and converted to a string before joining into a single string with newline characters.

### Correctness Check
1. **Expression Purpose**:
   - The expression `(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3))` does not seem to directly relate to the XOR operation or the goal of maximizing Bob's wins.
   - It appears to be a misinterpretation of the problem requirements.

2. **Expected Solution**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, we need to ensure that the final XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - The optimal strategy involves removing numbers to balance the counts of odd and even XOR results.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Count the number of ones, twos, and threes since fours do not affect the XOR result.
   - Calculate the number of pairs of ones and twos that can be formed (each pair results in a zero XOR).
   - The remaining ones and twos (if any) will determine the final XOR result.
   - Bob wins if the final XOR is zero, which happens when the number of unpaired ones and twos is even.

### Correct Program
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p1, p2, p3, p4 = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of ones and twos
        pairs = min(p1, p2)
        # Remaining ones and twos
        remaining_ones = p1 - pairs
        remaining_twos = p2 - pairs
        # Total remaining numbers
        total_remaining = remaining_ones + remaining_twos + p3
        # Bob wins if the total remaining numbers is even
        bob_wins = total_remaining % 2 == 0
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```
