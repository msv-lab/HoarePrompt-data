Output State: **`c` is the first element of `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `c` is 0, ans is 1 if cnt[1] was greater than 0, else ans is 0.**

Given the initial state where `c` is the first element of `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `c` is 0, the code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Since `c` is 0, `cnt[c]` (which is `cnt[0]`) is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` is then updated based on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If `cnt[1]` was already greater than 0 before this operation, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.
