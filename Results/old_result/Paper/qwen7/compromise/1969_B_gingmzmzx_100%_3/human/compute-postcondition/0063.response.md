Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for c in s:`. The objects involved here are `c` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is updated to be the list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().strip())`.
   - `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, but this is not directly used in the loop.
   - `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the updated list `s`, but this is not directly used in the loop.
   - `ans` is 0, but this is not directly used in the loop.
   - `n` is `n-1`, but this is not directly used in the loop.

3. **Adjust the states of the objects involved in the loop**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `s`. Therefore, `c` will take on each value in `s` one by one.
   - For the loop to start, `s` must contain at least one element.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must be a non-empty list (i.e., it must contain at least one element).
- `c` will take on the values from `s` one by one during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `s` is a non-empty list, `c` is the first element of `s`**
