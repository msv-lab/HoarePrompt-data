Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list of integers; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `s` is a non-empty list of integers, its state remains unchanged. The only change is that the count of the element `c` in the dictionary `cnt` is incremented by 1.
