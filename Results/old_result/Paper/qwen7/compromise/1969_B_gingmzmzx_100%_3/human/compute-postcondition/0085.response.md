Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]` are incremented by 1 for the next elements `0` and `1` in `s`, respectively. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding the difference between the number of zeroes in `s` and the new value of `cnt[0]`.
