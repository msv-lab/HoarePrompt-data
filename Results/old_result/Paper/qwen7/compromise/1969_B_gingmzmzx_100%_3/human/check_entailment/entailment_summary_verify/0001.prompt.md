You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the counts of '0's and '1's in the string. Specifically, `ans` is determined by counting the number of positions where a '0' is followed by a '1' and subtracting the number of positions where a '1' is followed by a '0', considering the current counts of '0's and '1's in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to transform a binary string into a sorted (non-descending) order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring shifted.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It converts the string `s` into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and calculates the answer (`ans`) based on certain conditions.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The logic in the program seems to be attempting to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. However, the logic is flawed.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the cost can be calculated by counting the number of inversions (positions where a 0 should come after a 1) and adding the length of the substring between them. This is not the correct approach for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. Each cyclic shift of a substring can be thought of as moving the end of the substring to the beginning. The correct approach involves finding the smallest index where the string can be split into two parts such that the first part is all 0s and the second part is all 1s. The cost would be the length of the substring starting from this index to the end of the string plus the length of the substring from the start to this index minus 1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
