Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is updated based on the value of `i`: if `i` equals '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (which can be either 2 or 0), and if `i` does not equal '*', `thorn` remains 0.
