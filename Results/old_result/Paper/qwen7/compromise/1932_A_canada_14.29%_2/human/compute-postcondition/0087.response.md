Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `thorn` is incremented by 1, `ret` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `thorn += 1` increments the value of `thorn` by 1. Since `i` equals '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `thorn` is incremented by 1, while `s`, `i`, and `ret` retain their original states.
