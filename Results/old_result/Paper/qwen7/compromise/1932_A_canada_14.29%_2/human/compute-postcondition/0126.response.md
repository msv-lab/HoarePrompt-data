Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.
2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `s` has at least one element and `i` is not `'@'`.
   - If `i` equals `'*'`, `thorn` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `ret` remains `0` and `thorn` remains `0`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `thorn` is `0`.
   - `ret` is either `0` or `1`.
   - `s` is a list that must have at least one element.
   - `i` is an element of `s` and `i` is not `'@'`.

4. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - Since `i` is an element of `s` and `i` is not `'@'`, the loop can continue if `s` still has elements and `i` does not change to `'@'`.
   - If `i` equals `'*'`, `thorn` will be set to `1`. Otherwise, `ret` and `thorn` remain unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `thorn` remains `0` unless `i` equals `'*'`.
   - `ret` remains `0` or `1` unless `i` equals `'*'`.
   - `s` must still have at least one element.
   - `i` must be an element of `s` and not `'@'`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`thorn` is 0, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a list that must have at least one element, `i` is an element of `s` and `i` is not '@'**.
