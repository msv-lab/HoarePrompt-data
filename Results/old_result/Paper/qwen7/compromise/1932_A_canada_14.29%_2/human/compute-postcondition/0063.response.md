Output State: **`s` is a list of characters that must have at least one character, and `i` is '*', and `thorn` is 2.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, since there is no loop or match statement context provided, the variables `s`, `i`, and `thorn` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the same values as the initial state.
