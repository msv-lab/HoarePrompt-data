Postcondition: **`thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input; `s` is a list of characters with at least two characters remaining; `ret` is 0; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` equals '@' and `thorn` is 1, `thorn` remains 1. Otherwise, if `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `thorn` is set to 0.**
