Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `thorn` is incremented by 1, `ret` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. In this case, since no loop or conditional statement is specified, the only effect is that the execution exits the current block of code. Therefore, the values of `s`, `i`, `thorn`, and `ret` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
