Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, and `thorn` is set based on the value of `i`:
   - If `i` equals '*', `thorn` is 2.
   - If `i` does not equal '*', `thorn` is 0.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `thorn` is either 2 or 0 depending on the value of `i`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be the current character being processed.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `s` remains the same as it is a list of characters.
   - `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `s` is still a list of characters with at least one character.
- `i` is the next character in the list `s`.
- `thorn` is updated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is 2 if `i` equals '*', and `thorn` is 0 if `i` does not equal '*'**.
