Output State: **`thorn` is 1 or 2, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a list that must have at least one element, `i` is an element of `s` and `i` is not `'@'`.**

Explanation: The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. Since `thorn` was initially either 0 or 1, it will now be either 1 or 2. The values of `ret`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
