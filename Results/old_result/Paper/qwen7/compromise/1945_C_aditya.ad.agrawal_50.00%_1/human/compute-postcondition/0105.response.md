Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. Therefore, `i` will take on each value in `arr` sequentially.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the last element of `arr`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the second-to-last element of `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is the last element of `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be the second-to-last element of `arr`.
   - The length of `arr` does not change within the loop, so the number of elements in `arr` remains the same.
   - The other variables (`pos`, `o_r`, `z_r`, and `b_d`) are not directly affected by the loop itself and their values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second-to-last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is either 0 or -1, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, and `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.**
