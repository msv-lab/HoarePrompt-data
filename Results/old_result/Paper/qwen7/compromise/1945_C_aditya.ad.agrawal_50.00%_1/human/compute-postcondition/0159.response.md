Output State: **`arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is either equal to its original value plus 2 or increased by 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is equal to `pos`.**

The code assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the value of `ans` is now equal to the value of `pos`. All other variables remain in their respective states as described in the precondition.
