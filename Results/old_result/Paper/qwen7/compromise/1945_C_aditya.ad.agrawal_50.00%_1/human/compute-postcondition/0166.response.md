Output State: **`arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1, `o_l` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `z_l` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `z_r` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables retain their values from the previous iteration as per the initial state.
