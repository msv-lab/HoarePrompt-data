Postcondition: **`i` is the third element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 4, `z_r` is -1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + 1) / 2` is true, `b_d` is 3, `ans` is 4, and either `z_l` is increased by 1 or `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. Since the else part is not provided, we only consider the if part's postcondition as the overall postcondition for the entire if-else block.
