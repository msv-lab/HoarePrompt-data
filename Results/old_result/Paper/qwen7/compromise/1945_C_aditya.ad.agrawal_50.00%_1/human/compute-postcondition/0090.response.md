Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second last element of `arr`, `pos` is assigned to `ans`, `o_r` is 0, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0, and the condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)))` is true.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `o_r`, `z_r`, and the condition) remain unchanged from their initial states.
