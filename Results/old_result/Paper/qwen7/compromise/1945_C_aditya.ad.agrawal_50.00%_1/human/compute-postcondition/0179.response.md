Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables where `t` is an integer between 1 and 20000 (inclusive), and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 3 and 300000 (inclusive), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
