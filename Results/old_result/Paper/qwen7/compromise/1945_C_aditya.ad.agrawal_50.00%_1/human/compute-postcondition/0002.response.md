Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains in its initial state**.

Explanation: The variable `t` was initially assigned a value from `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer within the specified range. The code then takes another input and assigns it to `n`. The string `a` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
