Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr`.

3. **Analyze the given postconditions**:
   - `arr` must have at least one element.
   - `pos` is either 2 or increased by 1 to `o_l + 1`.
   - `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is decreased by 1.
   - The condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true.
   - The condition `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is true.
   - `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.
   - `ans` is equal to `pos`.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, `i` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `arr` will lose one element after this iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `arr` will have one less element than it had before.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `arr` will have one less element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` will be the next element in `arr`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only say that `i` will be the next element in `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`arr` must have at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`**, `pos` is either 2 or increased by 1 to `o_l + 1`, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is decreased by 1, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is true, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `ans` is equal to `pos`**.
