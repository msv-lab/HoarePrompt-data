Postcondition: `arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second last element of `arr`, `pos` is assigned to `ans`, `o_r` is 0, `z_r` is 1 (since `z_r` was decreased by 1 when `i` was 0), `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and the condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)))` is true.
