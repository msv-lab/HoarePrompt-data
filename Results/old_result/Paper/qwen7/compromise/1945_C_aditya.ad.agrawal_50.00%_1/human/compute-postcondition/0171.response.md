Output State: **`arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_l` may be increased by 1, `o_r` may be decreased by 1, and `ans` is equal to `pos`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the current value of `pos` to `ans`. The values of `arr`, `i`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and `o_r` remain unchanged from their previous states. `pos` is increased by 1 as per the precondition.
