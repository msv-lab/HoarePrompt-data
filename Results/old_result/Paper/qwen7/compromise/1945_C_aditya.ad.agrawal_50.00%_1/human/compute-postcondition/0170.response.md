Postcondition: `arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_l` may be increased by 1, `o_r` may be decreased by 1, and `z_l` is increased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.
