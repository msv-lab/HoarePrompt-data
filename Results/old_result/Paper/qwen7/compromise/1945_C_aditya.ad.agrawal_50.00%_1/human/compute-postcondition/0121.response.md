Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to the index where `ans` was last updated, `o_r` is the final count of 1s minus the final count of 0s seen so far, `z_r` is the final count of 0s minus the final count of 1s seen so far, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`, `o_l` and `z_l` are the cumulative counts of 1s and 0s seen throughout the entire execution of the loop, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `input_string` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `input_string = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `input_string`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, all the other variables retain their previous states.
