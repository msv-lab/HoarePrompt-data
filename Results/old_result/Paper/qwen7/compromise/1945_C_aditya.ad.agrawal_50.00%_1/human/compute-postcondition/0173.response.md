Postcondition: `arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_l` may be increased by 1, `o_r` may be decreased by 1, and `z_l` is increased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1; if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, then `ans` is equal to `pos`; otherwise, the values of `arr`, `i`, `pos`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `z_l` remain as they were after the if condition check.
