Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second-to-last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 2, `o_r` is either 0 or -1, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `o_l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
