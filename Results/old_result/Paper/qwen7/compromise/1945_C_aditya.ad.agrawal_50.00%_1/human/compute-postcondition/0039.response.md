Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + 1) / 2` is true, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. Since `z_l` was previously part of a condition that was true (`z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`), and now `z_l` has increased by 1, the condition remains true. The value of `ans` is updated from 1 to 2 because it is directly incremented by 1 due to the nature of the problem setup. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
