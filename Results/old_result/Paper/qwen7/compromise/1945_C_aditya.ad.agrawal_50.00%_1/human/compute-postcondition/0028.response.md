Output State: **`o_l` is increased by 1, `i` is the first element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

The code `o_r -= 1` decreases the value of `o_r` by 1. The other variables (`o_l`, `i`, and `pos`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
