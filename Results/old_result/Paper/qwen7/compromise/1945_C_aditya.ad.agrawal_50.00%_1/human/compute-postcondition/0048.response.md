Output State: **`i` is the third element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 4, `z_r` is -1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + 1) / 2` is true, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `ans` is 3, `b_d` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the conditions provided.
