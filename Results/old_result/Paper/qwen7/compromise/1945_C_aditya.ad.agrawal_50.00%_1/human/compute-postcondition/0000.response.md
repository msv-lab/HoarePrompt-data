Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. The variable `n` and string `a` remain in their initial state as defined in the precondition.**

This means that `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, and it is guaranteed to be within the specified range. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
