You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():

                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` will be equal to `t-1` (since the loop runs from `e` in range `t`), `l` is the length of the list `nums`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #- The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) as it was initially set.
    #- The variable `e` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `e` in the range `t`.
    #- The variable `l` is set to the length of the list `nums` when the loop starts.
    #- The variable `x` is updated during each iteration to hold the maximum value encountered in the list `nums`.
    #- The variable `y` is updated during each iteration to hold the minimum value encountered in the list `nums`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop, `x` will contain the highest value in the list `nums`, and `y` will contain the lowest value in the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of subsequent test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It finds the maximum and minimum values in the list of integers and prints the difference between these two values. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program is flawed because it simply finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and subtracts them, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array according to the given formula.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The program would output `1` because it finds the maximum value `4` and the minimum value `3`, and calculates `4 - 3 = 1`. However, the correct approach would be to rearrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. For the given input, the optimal arrangement is `[3, 4, 3]`, which results in a beauty of `(4-3) + (3-3) = 1`, but another possible optimal arrangement is `[3, 3, 4]`, which also results in a beauty of `(3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.

To correctly solve this problem, Sasha needs to sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting. This ensures that the differences are maximized.
