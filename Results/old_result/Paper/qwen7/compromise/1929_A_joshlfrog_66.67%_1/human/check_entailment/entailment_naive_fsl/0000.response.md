Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program is flawed because it simply finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and subtracts them, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array according to the given formula.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The program would output `1` because it finds the maximum value `4` and the minimum value `3`, and calculates `4 - 3 = 1`. However, the correct approach would be to rearrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. For the given input, the optimal arrangement is `[3, 4, 3]`, which results in a beauty of `(4-3) + (3-3) = 1`, but another possible optimal arrangement is `[3, 3, 4]`, which also results in a beauty of `(3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.

To correctly solve this problem, Sasha needs to sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting. This ensures that the differences are maximized.
