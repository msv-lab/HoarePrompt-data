Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the solution only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, l))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This solution sorts the array and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which maximizes the beauty of the array.
