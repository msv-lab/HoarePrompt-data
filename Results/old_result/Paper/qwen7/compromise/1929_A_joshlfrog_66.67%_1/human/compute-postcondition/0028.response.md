Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is the minimum value between the current `y` and `nums[i]`, and `y` is updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i] < y` or remains unchanged otherwise.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. This means `y` now holds the value of `nums[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for updating `x` is not directly affected by this line of code, but `y` is explicitly updated to `nums[i]`.
