Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the maximum value between the current `x` and `nums[i]` if `nums[i] < y`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged, and `y` is updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i] < y` or remains unchanged otherwise.
