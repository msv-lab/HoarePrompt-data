Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, and `y` is the minimum value between the original `y` and `nums[i]`; `y` is updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i] < y` or remains unchanged otherwise.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. This means that `y` is now set to the current value of `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` was less than the original value of `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. All other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, `x`) retain their previous values.
