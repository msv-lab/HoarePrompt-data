Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means it now holds the integer value entered by the user. The values of `t`, `e`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
