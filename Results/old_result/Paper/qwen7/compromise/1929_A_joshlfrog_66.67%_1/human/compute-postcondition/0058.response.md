Output State: **`l` is a positive integer and at least 1, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. The initial value of `i` is `i + 1`, so the updated value of `i` is `i + 1`. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `x` is now the value of `nums[i]`, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
