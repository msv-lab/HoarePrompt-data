Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `l`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration.
   - The variable `l` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial states:
- `l` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 100000000.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `l` for the loop to execute. Specifically:
- `i` should start at 0.
- `l` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` is 0.
- `l` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0**
