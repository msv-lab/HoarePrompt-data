Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is greater than 0, `y` is either the same as before or `nums[0]`, `x` is `nums[1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `nums[i]` to `x`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `x` is now set to `nums[1]`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
