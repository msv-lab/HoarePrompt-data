You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 2 * n - 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have incremented from 3 to `n + 2` (since the loop runs from 3 to `n` inclusive and increments `i` by 1 each time). Therefore, `i` will be `n + 2`, which can be rewritten as `2 * n - 1` since `i` starts at 3 and increases by 1 each iteration. The variable `n` must be at least 11 for the loop to run the maximum number of times required to reach `i = 2 * n - 1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). It prints a sequence of numbers starting with (1, 1) followed by (1, 2), and then a series of pairs (i, i) for `i` ranging from 3 to `n` (inclusive). After processing, the loop variable `i` equals `2 * n - 1`, and `n` must be at least 11 for the loop to run the maximum number of times. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - The program prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` initially.
   - Then, it prints coordinates of the form `(i, i)` for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of `n`**:
   - For \( n = 2 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 2, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 4, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 7, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 5 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     6 6
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 10, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 6 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     5 5
     6 6
     7 7
     ```
     This results in the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 13, which is correct.

4. **Conclusion**: The program correctly generates the required coordinates to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for different values of \( n \).

Correctness: **True**
