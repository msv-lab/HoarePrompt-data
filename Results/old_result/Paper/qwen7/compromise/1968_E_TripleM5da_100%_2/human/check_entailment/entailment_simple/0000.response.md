Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program always prints the same two points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` followed by a series of points `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n`. However, the goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. 

The given solution only works for very small values of `n` and does not provide a general strategy to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for larger values of `n`. For example, for `n = 3`, the provided solution would output:

```
1 1
1 2
3 3
3 3
```

This does not match the optimal solution provided in the problem statement, which includes points like `(2, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 1)`.

Therefore, the program is not correct for the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
