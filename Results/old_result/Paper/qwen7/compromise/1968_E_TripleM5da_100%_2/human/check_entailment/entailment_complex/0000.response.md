Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic needed to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Instead, it prints a fixed pattern of points regardless of the value of \(n\).
3. For \(n = 2\), the annotated program prints:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   3 3
   ```
   This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct for \(n = 2\). However, this pattern does not generalize to larger values of \(n\) to maximize \(\mathcal{H}\).
4. For \(n = 3\), the annotated program prints:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   3 3
   4 4
   ```
   This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is also correct for \(n = 3\). However, the general pattern does not maximize \(\mathcal{H}\) for larger \(n\).

Given the examples in the problem statement, the correct approach involves placing points in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances. The annotated program does not achieve this for \(n > 2\).

Therefore, the annotated program is not correct for \(n > 2\).

Correctness: **False**
