Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of \( n \). Specifically, the program only prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and then \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all \( n \).

For example, for \( n = 3 \), the output would be:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
4 4
```
This results in the set of Manhattan distances:
\[ \{0, 1, 2\} \]
which is correct but not maximal. The maximal set of distances for \( n = 3 \) should include distances up to 3, as shown in the example provided in the problem statement.

A correct solution would need to strategically place the points to ensure the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.
