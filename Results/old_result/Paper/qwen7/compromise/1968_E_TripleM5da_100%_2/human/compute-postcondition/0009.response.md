Output: **4 4**

Explanation: 
- The initial state defines that `i` is 4.
- The print statement `print(i, i)` will print the value of `i` twice.
- Since `i` is explicitly defined as 4, both instances of `i` in the print statement will be replaced with the number 4.
- Therefore, the output will be `4 4`.
