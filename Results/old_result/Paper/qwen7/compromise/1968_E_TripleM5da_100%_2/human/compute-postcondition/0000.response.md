Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the value obtained from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `int(input())` reads an integer input from the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `t` is given a specific range, but it doesn't directly affect the loop's execution. Instead, the loop's execution depends on the user input.
   - The loop will execute if and only if `int(input())` is a positive integer. Given the constraints, `int(input())` should be within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 50\) because `t` is constrained to this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be used in the loop, ensuring it falls within the valid range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and the input must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ input ≤ 50**
