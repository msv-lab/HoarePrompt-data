Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have incremented from 3 to 6 (since the loop runs from 3 to `n` inclusive and prints each value of `i`). The variable `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to run exactly 3 times. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
