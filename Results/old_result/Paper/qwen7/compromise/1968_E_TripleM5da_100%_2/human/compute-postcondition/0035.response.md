Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 9.
- `n` must be at least 9, but its exact value is not relevant for the print statement.

The print statement is `print(i, i)`. Since `i` is explicitly given as 9, both instances of `i` in the print statement will be 9.

Output: **9 9**
