Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 100, `n` must be at least 99.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have incremented from 3 to `n + 2`. Since the loop runs from 3 to `n` inclusive, if the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 2`. Given that the loop runs for `n - 2` iterations (from 3 to `n`), the maximum value of `i` will be when `n` is at its maximum possible value, which is \(10^3\) (1000). Therefore, `i` will be `1000 + 2 = 1001 - 2 = 99 + 2 = 100`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and stays within the range of 1 to 50 as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `n` must be at least 99 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.
