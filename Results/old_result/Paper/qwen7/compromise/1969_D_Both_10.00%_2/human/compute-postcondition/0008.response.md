Output State: `sub_summ'` is the sum of all elements `[val_a[0]]` in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sub_summ` will hold the sum of the first elements of all the sub-arrays (or lists) in `sec_arr`. The condition that `sec_arr` is a non-empty list remains true, and `val_a` will be the last sub-array processed in `sec_arr`.
