Output State: **`sub_summ'` is now `sub_summ' + val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the second element in `sec_arr`**

Explanation: The code `sub_summ += val_a[0]` adds the first element of the list `val_a` (which is the second element in `sec_arr`) to `sub_summ`. Since `sub_summ` was initially `0 + val_a[0]`, after executing the code, `sub_summ` becomes `sub_summ' + val_a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
