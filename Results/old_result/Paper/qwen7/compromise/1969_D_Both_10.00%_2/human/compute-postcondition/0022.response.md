Postcondition: `sub_summ` is either `0` (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] < 0`) or `0 + val_b[0] + val_b[1]` (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`), `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`, and `main_ar` must have at least one element left. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, then `sub_summ` is updated to `sub_summ + val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.
