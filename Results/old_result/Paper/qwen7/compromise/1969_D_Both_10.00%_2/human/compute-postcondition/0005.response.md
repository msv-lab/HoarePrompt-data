Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `sec_arr`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `sec_arr` must contain at least one more element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sub_summ'` is now `sub_summ' + val_a[0]`.
   - `sec_arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `val_a` is the second element in `sec_arr`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `val_a` is the second element in `sec_arr`, it means that `sec_arr` had at least two elements before this iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least one more element.
   - After the current iteration, `val_a` will be set to the next element in `sec_arr`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `sub_summ'` remains the same because the loop body is omitted, and there's no operation that modifies `sub_summ'` outside the loop.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.
   - `val_a` will be set to the next element in `sec_arr`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `sub_summ'` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `sec_arr` must have at least one more element.
- `val_a` will be set to the next element in `sec_arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`sub_summ'` is now `sub_summ' + val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list that must have at least one more element, `val_a` is the third element in `sec_arr`**
