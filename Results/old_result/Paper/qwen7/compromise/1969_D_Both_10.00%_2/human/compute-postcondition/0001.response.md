State: **`sub_summ'` is 0, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the first element in `sec_arr`**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head contains three variables: `val_a`, `sec_arr`, and the loop index (which is implicit in the `enumerate` function but not explicitly mentioned here).
2. **Determine Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `sec_arr` is a non-empty list. If `sec_arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. **Initial State Adjustment**: Before the loop starts, `sub_summ'` is 0. This variable is not directly related to the loop's execution condition but is part of the initial state.
4. **Loop Initialization**: For the loop to start, `sec_arr` must contain at least one element. The variable `val_a` will be set to the first element of `sec_arr` during the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `sec_arr` must be a non-empty list and `val_a` should be initialized to the first element of `sec_arr`.
