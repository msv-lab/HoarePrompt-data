### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correctly defined and parse the input as expected.
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to maximize Alice's profit by considering different scenarios based on the number of items Alice buys and the number of items Bob takes for free.
   - The program sorts the items based on their `b_i` values (Bob's price).
   - It uses a min heap (`k_arr`) to keep track of the top `k` items with the highest `b_i` values.
   - The program iterates through the sorted items and calculates the potential profit for different scenarios.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where Alice buys fewer than `k` items, allowing Bob to take all of them for free.
   - The program also correctly handles the scenario where Alice buys more than or exactly `k` items, allowing Bob to take `k` items for free and pay for the rest.
   - The logic for updating `sub_sum` and `max_value` is correct, ensuring that the maximum possible profit for Alice is calculated.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when Alice buys fewer than `k` items and when the sum of `a_i` and `b_i` is non-positive.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize Alice's profit under the given constraints and rules.
