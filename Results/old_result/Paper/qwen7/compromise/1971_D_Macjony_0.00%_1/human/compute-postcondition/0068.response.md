Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `s` is a new string input by the user with a length greater than or equal to 5, `count` is either 3 or 2, `flag` is True, `j` is either 5 or 4. If the character at position `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1`, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 2. If the characters are equal, `j` remains unchanged.
