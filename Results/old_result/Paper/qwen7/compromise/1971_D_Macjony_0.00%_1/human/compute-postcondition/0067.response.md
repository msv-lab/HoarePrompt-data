Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `s` is a new string input by the user with a length greater than or equal to 5, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `j` is 5. If the character at position `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1`, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 2.
