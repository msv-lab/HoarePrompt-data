Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables remain unchanged, and the only updated information is that `t` now holds the value of the input integer.
