Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `s` is the string input by the user and its length must be greater than 4, `count` is 4, `flag` is True, `j` is 4. If the substring `s[j]` (which is `s[4]`) is '0' and the next character `s[j + 1]` (which is `s[5]`) is '1', then `j` remains 4. Otherwise, `j` remains 4.
