You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from input. It then prints either `(x, y)` if `x` is less than `y`, or `(y, x)` otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results of each comparison.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x` from the first line.
2. **Loop Iteration**: It then iterates `x` times to handle each test case.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings. `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers.
4. **Finding Min and Max**: 
   - If `x < y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the requirement of printing the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value for each test case.

Given that the logic correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values and prints them in the required order, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
