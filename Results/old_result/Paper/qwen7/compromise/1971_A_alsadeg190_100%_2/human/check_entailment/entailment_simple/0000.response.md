Reasoning:
1. The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers `x` and `y` for each test case.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement this logic. It reads `x` at the beginning and then iterates `i` from `0` to `x-1`. However, `x` here should represent the number of test cases (`t`), not be used in the loop.
3. Inside the loop, the program correctly reads `x` and `y` for each test case and prints the minimum and maximum accordingly.
4. The issue is with the loop range, which should iterate `t` times, not `x` times.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it uses `x` incorrectly in the loop range.

Correctness: **False**
