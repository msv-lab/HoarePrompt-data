Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**: The program constructs a template by comparing characters of strings `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position are the same, it adds the character directly to the template. If they are different, it adds the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template. This ensures that both `a` and `b` will match the template since `a[i]` and `b[i]` are either the same or `a[i]` is different from the lowercase version of `b[i]`.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - It checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template. For lowercase letters in the template, both `a` and `b` should match. For uppercase letters, neither `a` nor `b` should match the lowercase version of the template character.
   - It then checks if `c` does not match the template. For lowercase letters in the template, `c` should not match. For uppercase letters, `c` should not match the lowercase version of the template character.

3. **Output Logic**: If both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `a` and `b` are identical and differ only in case from `c`.
   - The template construction logic ensures that the conditions for matching `a` and `b` are met while ensuring `c` does not match.

5. **Loop Iterations**: The program correctly iterates over each character of the strings for each test case, ensuring that the conditions are checked for all positions.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
