You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: Output State: `match_a_b` is either `True` or `False`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `3`, and `n` is greater than `3`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` will depend on the conditions checked within the loops. The variable `i` will be set to `3` because it is incremented in the innermost loop, which runs up to `n-1`, and the loop iterates `t` times. Since `t` is the input integer and we know it is between 1 and 1000, `n` (which is the length of string `a`) will be greater than `3` as per the given conditions after three iterations. The final values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` will reflect whether the conditions specified in the loop were met for all inputs processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases, 1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 1000), an integer \( n \) (length of strings, 1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 20), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) (each of length \( n \) and containing only lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, it constructs a template string based on the comparison of \( a \) and \( b \), checks if \( a \) and \( b \) match according to the template, and then checks if \( c \) matches the template. If \( a \) and \( b \) match but \( c \) does not, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Creating Template:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `template`.
   - It then iterates through each character in the strings `a` and `b`:
     - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character from `a` to `template`.
     - If the characters are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to `template`.

3. **Checking if Strings `a` and `b` Match the Template:**
   - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the template by iterating through the `template`:
     - If a character in `template` is lowercase, it checks if both `a` and `b` match the character.
     - If a character in `template` is uppercase, it checks if either `a` or `b` does not match the lowercase version of the character.

4. **Checking if String `c` Does Not Match the Template:**
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the template by iterating through the `template`:
     - If a character in `template` is lowercase, it checks if `c` does not match the character.
     - If a character in `template` is uppercase, it checks if `c` matches the lowercase version of the character.

5. **Output:**
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     1
     a
     b
     c
     2
     aa
     bb
     aa
     10
     mathforces
     luckforces
     adhoccoder
     3
     acc
     abd
     abc
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     YES
     NO
     YES
     NO
     ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - For the first test case, the template is "C", which matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
     - For the second test case, the template would be "AA", which matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
     - For the third test case, the template is "CODEforces", which matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
     - For the fourth test case, no template can satisfy the conditions.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `a` and `b` have different characters at some positions, the template will reflect those differences correctly.
   - If `a` and `b` have the same characters, the template will reflect them as lowercase.
   - If `c` has characters that do not match the template, it will be correctly identified.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to check if there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`. Therefore, the program is correct.
