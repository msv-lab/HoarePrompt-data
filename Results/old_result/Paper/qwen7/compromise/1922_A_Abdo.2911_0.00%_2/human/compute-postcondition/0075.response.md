Postcondition: `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is True, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase character. If the lowercase version of `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing changes.
