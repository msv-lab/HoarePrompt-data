Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in, but it does not change the values of the variables `match_a_b`, `i`, `n`, or `template[i]`. The conditions and values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
