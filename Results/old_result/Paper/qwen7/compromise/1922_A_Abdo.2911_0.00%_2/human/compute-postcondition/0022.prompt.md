Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `c` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `template` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `c` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `template` is a list containing one element which is either `a[0]` or `a[i]` in uppercase, `i` is 1, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` if the condition `a[i] == b[i]` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `c` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `template` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `a[0]` or `a[2]` in uppercase and the second element is `a[2]` in uppercase, `i` is 2, and `a[2]` is not equal to `b[2]` regardless of the if condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `template` is a list. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` has had the element `a[i]` appended to it. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `template` has had its last element appended with the uppercase version of `a[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
