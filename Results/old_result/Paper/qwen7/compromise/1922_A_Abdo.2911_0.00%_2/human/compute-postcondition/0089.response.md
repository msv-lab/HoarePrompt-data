Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i+2]` is not a lowercase character**

Explanation: The code sets `match_c` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `match_a_b` remains `False`, `match_c` is now `False`, `n` is still greater than 0, and `template[i+2]` is still not a lowercase character.
