Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: 
   - `match_a_b` is `False`.
   - `match_c` is `False`.
   - `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `template` is an empty list.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The loop can only execute if `n` is a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0).
   - The initial value of `i` is 0 because `range(n)` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the final state should be:
State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
