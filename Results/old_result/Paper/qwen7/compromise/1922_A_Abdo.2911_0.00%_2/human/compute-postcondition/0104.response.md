Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- `match_a_b` is `False`.
- `match_c` is `False`.
- `n` is the length of string `a`, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- The condition `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` evaluates to `False` because `match_a_b` is `False`.

Since the condition inside the print statement is not relevant to the output, the print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.
