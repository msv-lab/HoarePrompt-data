Postcondition: `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is True, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase character. If `template[i]` is a lowercase character, either `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]` (in which case we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement).
