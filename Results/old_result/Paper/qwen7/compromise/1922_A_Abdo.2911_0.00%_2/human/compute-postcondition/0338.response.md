Postcondition: `match_c` is either False or True, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then the function does not change the values of `match_c`, `i`, and `n`. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is also True, then the function does not change the values of `match_c`, `i`, and `n`.
