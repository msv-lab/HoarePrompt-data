Output State: **`i` is `4 * n`, `match_c` remains `False`, `match_a_b` is `True` if the if condition is met, otherwise `match_a_b` is `False`, `t` is reduced by 1, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` reads an input from the user and strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it. It assigns this stripped input to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `match_c`, `match_a_b`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is used in the calculation of `i`, which is `4 * n`.
