Output State: **`i` is 4 * `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than `n`, and a variable `template` has appended the element at index `i` of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `template`. However, the initial state of `i` being 4 * `n` and `i` being less than `n` is contradictory because `i` cannot be both 4 * `n` and less than `n` simultaneously unless `n` is 0, which contradicts the condition that `n` must be greater than 0. Since the problem specifies the conditions and does not provide the actual list `a`, we assume that the code execution did append the element at index `i` to `template`, but the initial state of `i` being 4 * `n` and `i` < `n` remains contradictory and thus is kept as part of the output state.
