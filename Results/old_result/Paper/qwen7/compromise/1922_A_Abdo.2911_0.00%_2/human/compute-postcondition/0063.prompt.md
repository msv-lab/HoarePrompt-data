Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is `True`, `n` is the length of string `a`, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `c` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `template` is a list containing elements based on the comparison of characters in strings `a` and `b`. Specifically, if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `a[i]` is appended to `template`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the last element in `template` is changed to the uppercase version of `a[i]`. The value of `i` will be `n-1`, as the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is the length of string `a`, and either:
- `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, in which case `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
- The character at index `i` of `template` is not lowercase. Additionally, either the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` after lowercasing, or the character at index `i` of `b` is equal to the character at index `template` after lowercasing, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is the length of string `a`, `match_a_b` is False, and either `a[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the length of string `a`, `match_a_b` is False, and if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
