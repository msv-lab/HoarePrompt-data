Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_c` is True, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character. If the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the lowercase versions are equal, we break out of the loop. If the lowercase versions are not equal, no change is made to `match_c`, `i`, `n`, and `template[i]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 3. If `c[i].lower()` does not equal `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `match_c` is either False (if `template[2].islower()` is True and we break out of the loop) or True (if `template[2].islower()` is False or `c[2].lower()` equals `template[2].lower()`), `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
