Output State: `i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `match_a_b` is `False`.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `2 * n + (n - 1)` because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, it will run `n` times, and `i` will be incremented `n` times, starting from `2 * n - 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 ensures that the loop runs at least once. Given that `match_a_b` was set to `False` after the third iteration and no subsequent conditions in the loop would change this value, `match_a_b` remains `False` after all iterations of the loop.
