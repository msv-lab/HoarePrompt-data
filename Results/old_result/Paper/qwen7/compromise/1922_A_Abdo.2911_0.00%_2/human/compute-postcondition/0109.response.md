Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `match_c` is `False`, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the input string (stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace) to the variable `b`. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
