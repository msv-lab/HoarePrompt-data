Output State: `match_a_b` is `False`, `match_c` is `True`, `n` is the length of string `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `match_a_b` remains `False` because the loop breaks whenever a mismatch is found, and there was no condition that could change `match_a_b` to `True`. The value of `match_c` remains `True` unless a mismatch is found during the loop's execution, which would set `match_c` to `False` and break the loop. Since the loop did not break (meaning no mismatches were found), `match_c` stays `True`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of string `a` and is not modified within the loop.
