Output State: **match_a_b is False, i is 3, n is greater than 3.**

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `match_a_b` remains `False` because it was set to `False` during one of the iterations (as indicated by the conditions provided for the first three iterations). The variable `i` is 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations up to the third index. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 3 since the loop ran at least four times to reach `i` being 3.
