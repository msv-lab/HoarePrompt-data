Output State: **`i` is `3 * n - 1`, `match_c` is `False`**

Explanation: The variable `match_c` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The value of `i` is calculated as `3 * n - 1` from the initial state, and since `n` must be greater than 0, this relationship remains unchanged. No other variables are affected by the given code snippet.
