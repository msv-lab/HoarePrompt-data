Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i+1]` is not a lowercase character.**

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement is associated with, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `n`, and `template[i+1]` remain unchanged.
