Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the character at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter, `match_c` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter, no change is made to `match_c` and the loop continues as normal. If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.
