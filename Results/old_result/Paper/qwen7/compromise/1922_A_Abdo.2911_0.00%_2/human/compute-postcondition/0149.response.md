Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `template[i]` is either a lowercase letter where the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` matches `template[i]`, or `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, `match_a_b` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken if the characters do not match. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, the program continues execution without changing the values of `i`, `n`, and `template[i]`.
