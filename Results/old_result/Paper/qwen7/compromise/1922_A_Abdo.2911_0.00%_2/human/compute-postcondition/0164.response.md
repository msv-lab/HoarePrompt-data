Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `match_a_b` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `i` or `n`, nor does it affect the condition on `n`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The value of `match_a_b` remains `False`.
