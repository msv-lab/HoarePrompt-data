State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Given that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the minimum value `t` can take is 1.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since the loop head only involves `t`, this is the only state that needs adjustment.
