Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing either `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `2 * n - 1`, or `2 * n`. For each line, the value depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` provided in the input. If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the output is `math.ceil(k / 2)`. If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n - 1`. If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`.
