Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `k` is close to but less than `4 * n - 2`. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - When `k <= 4 * n - 4`, the solution correctly prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - When `k == 4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`, which is correct.
   - When `k == 4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`, which is also correct.

2. **Missed Cases:**
   - For other values of `k` between `4 * n - 4` and `4 * n - 2`, the solution does not provide the optimal coloring strategy. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where fewer cells can be colored to meet the requirement.

### Example:
- For `n = 3` and `k = 5`, the solution will incorrectly print `3` instead of `2`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the solution considers all possible configurations and finds the minimum number of cells required. Hereâ€™s an improved version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        min_cells = float('inf')
        
        # Case when k <= 4*n - 4
        min_cells = min(min_cells, math.ceil(k / 2))
        
        # Case when k == 4*n - 3
        if k == 4 * n - 3:
            min_cells = min(min_cells, 2 * n - 1)
        
        # Case when k == 4*n - 2
        if k == 4 * n - 2:
            min_cells = min(min_cells, 2 * n)
        
        # General case: cover remaining cases
        if k > 4 * n - 4:
            min_cells = min(min_cells, n + math.ceil((k - (4 * n - 4)) / 2))
        
        print(min_cells)

func()
```

This version ensures that all cases are considered and the minimum number of cells required is calculated accurately.
