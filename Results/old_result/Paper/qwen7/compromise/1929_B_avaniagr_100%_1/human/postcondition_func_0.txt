Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). It reads these values from standard input, calculates a specific output based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \), and prints the result for each test case. Specifically, if \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \); if \( k = 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n - 1 \); and if \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \). The function does not return any value but outputs a series of lines, each containing one of the calculated results.
