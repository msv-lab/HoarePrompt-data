Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
- If the conditions for a stair are met, it prints 'STAIR'.
- If the conditions for a peak are met, it prints 'PEAK'.
- If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
- The program processes all test cases as described in the execution summary.

Given that the program follows the specified logic accurately and matches the expected behavior as described in the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
