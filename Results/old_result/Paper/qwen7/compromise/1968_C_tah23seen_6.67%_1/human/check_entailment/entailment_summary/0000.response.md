Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program and the execution summary to determine if the program correctly implements the required logic.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Construction**: The function `func_1` constructs the array `ans` based on the provided logic.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element `ans[i+1]`, it starts from `arr[i] + ans[i]` and keeps adding `ans[i]` until the value exceeds `arr[i+1]`.
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is computed as the sum of all previous elements plus `arr[-1]`.

3. **Modulo Condition**: The program does not directly check if the modulo condition holds for each `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. Instead, it constructs `a_i` such that the sequence grows exponentially, ensuring that the modulo condition will be satisfied due to the nature of the construction.

4. **Output**: The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_1`, the program should generate arrays `a` that satisfy the given conditions. The construction method ensures that each `a_i` is greater than `a_{i-1}`, and the exponential growth guarantees that the modulo condition will hold.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the provided execution summary and the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
