Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the function `func_1` correctly generates an array `a` such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

Let's analyze the logic of the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `ans[0]` is greater than `arr[0]`.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each index \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \):
     - `ans[i]` is initially set to the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i-1]`.
     - If `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, the loop continues to add `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` until `ans[i]` is no longer less than `arr[i]`. This ensures that `ans[i]` is the smallest value such that `ans[i] \bmod ans[i-1] = arr[i]`.

3. **Final element**:
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[-2]` plus `arr[-1]`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach should work as intended. Here's why:

- The initial value `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that the modulo operation will yield `arr[0]` when `arr[0]` is taken modulo `ans[0]`.
- The loop ensures that each subsequent `ans[i]` is chosen such that `ans[i] \bmod ans[i-1] = arr[i]`. By incrementing `ans[i]` in steps of `ans[i-1]`, we ensure that the condition holds true.
- The final element `ans[-1]` is constructed to satisfy the modulo condition with `arr[-1]`.

Since the function follows the required logic and constraints, and the problem description matches the implementation, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
