Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`**.

This means that the first element of the `ans` list, `ans[0]`, has been updated to be equal to `arr[0] + 1`. All other elements in the `ans` list remain 0, and the `arr` list remains unchanged with its original values.
