Output State: The final state of `ans` will be a list of \( n \) elements where each element is calculated based on the initial value of `ans[0]` and the values in `arr`. Specifically, `ans[i]` for \( 0 \leq i < n \) will be the sum of a geometric progression starting from `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`, doubling each step, until the sum either exceeds `arr[i + 1]` or the end of the loop is reached.

To break it down further:
- `ans[0]` starts as `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each subsequent `i` from 0 to \( n-2 \):
  - `ans[i + 1]` is initially set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
  - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, `ans[i + 1]` is incremented by `ans[i]` in a loop until it exceeds `arr[i + 1]`.

Thus, `ans[i + 1]` will be the maximum possible sum of a geometric series starting from `arr[0] + 1` and doubling each step, constrained by `arr[i + 1]`.
