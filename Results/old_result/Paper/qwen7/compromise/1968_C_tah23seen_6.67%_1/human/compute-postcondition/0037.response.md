Postcondition: `ans[i + 1]` is updated to the sum of all previous `ans[i]` values up to the last iteration where the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` was satisfied. Specifically, `ans[i + 1]` accumulates the sum of a geometric progression starting from `ans[0]`, doubling each step, until it either exceeds `arr[i + 1]` or the loop terminates.
