The function accepts a list `arr` of `n-1` integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `1 â‰¤ i < n`, `ans[i]` is the sum of a sequence starting from `arr[0] + 1` and doubling each step until the next term would exceed `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[-2]` plus `arr[-1]`.
