Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the same integer in the list `a` and prints `-1` if all elements are the same. However, this approach does not address the requirement to make the array non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the indices where the array can still be made beautiful by removing elements. Specifically, we should look for indices `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`. We need to count the minimum number of such indices that must be removed to break the condition for the array to be beautiful.

The current implementation does not account for these conditions and instead focuses on finding the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the same integer, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
