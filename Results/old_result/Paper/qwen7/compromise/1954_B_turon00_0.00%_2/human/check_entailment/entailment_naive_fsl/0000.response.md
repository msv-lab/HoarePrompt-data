Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the requirement that the array must be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. Instead, it checks if the first element is repeated and counts the maximum consecutive occurrences of that element, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program would output `1`, but the correct answer should be `1` because removing the first `1` makes the array `[2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is no longer beautiful. However, the program incorrectly counts the maximum consecutive `1`s and outputs `1` without considering the possibility of removing other elements to achieve the same result with fewer removals.

Another example is:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The program would output `3`, but the correct answer should be `3` because removing the first three `3`s makes the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is no longer beautiful. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple elements need to be removed to break the beauty condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
