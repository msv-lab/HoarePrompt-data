Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 2`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This updates the value of `cnt` but does not affect any other variables. The initial conditions for `a`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged except for `cnt`.
