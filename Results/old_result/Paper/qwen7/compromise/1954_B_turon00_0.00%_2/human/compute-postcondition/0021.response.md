Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated accordingly.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
