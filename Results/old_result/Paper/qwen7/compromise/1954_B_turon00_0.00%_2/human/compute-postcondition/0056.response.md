Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `i` is still equal to `n-1`, and `ans` is still the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`, which is now 0.
