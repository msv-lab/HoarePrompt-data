Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the current value of `cnt`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
