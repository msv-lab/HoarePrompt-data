Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, and `tmp` retains its initial value.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Given that `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be updated to either its current value or 0, whichever is smaller. The values of `i` and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not affected by this line of code.
