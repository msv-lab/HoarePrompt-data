Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
