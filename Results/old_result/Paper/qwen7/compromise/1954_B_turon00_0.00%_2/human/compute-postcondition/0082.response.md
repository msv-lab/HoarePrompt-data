Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `ans`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, and `a[0]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, or `a[0]`. The value of `ans` remains the minimum between `ans` and `cnt` before the assignment, which is `ans` since `cnt` was just set to 0.
