Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `tmp` is an integer, the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`.**

In this case, the code initializes `cnt` to 0. Since `cnt` was previously updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and now `cnt` is explicitly set to 0, `ans` will be set to 0 if `ans` was greater than 0. However, since the exact value of `ans` before this line is not specified, we only know that `cnt` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
