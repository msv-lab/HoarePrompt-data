Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `tmp` retains its initial value (though `tmp` is not used in the print statement).

Since `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, if `ans` was greater than 0 before this update, it would now be 0. If `ans` was already 0 or negative, it remains unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print(ans)
```

Given the information, the value of `ans` after the update will be 0 if it was greater than 0 initially, and will remain 0 if it was 0 or negative.

Output: **0**
