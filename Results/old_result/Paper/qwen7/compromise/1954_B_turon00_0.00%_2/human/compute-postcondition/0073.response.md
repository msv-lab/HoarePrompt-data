Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
- `cnt` is an input integer.
- `tmp` is now equal to `a[0]`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of unique integers.
- `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`. The values of `ans`, `cnt`, `tmp`, `a`, and `t` are not relevant to this particular print statement since it does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **-1**
