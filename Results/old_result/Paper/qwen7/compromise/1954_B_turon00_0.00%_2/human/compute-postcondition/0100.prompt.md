Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other preconditions remain valid.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    aa = set(a)
    if len(aa) == 1:
        print(-1)
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, `t` will be decremented by the number of iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `tmp` will be equal to the last element of the list `a`, `cnt` will be 0, and `aa` will still contain all elements of the list `a` as a set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, and `tmp` retains its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `tmp` is still equal to `a[0]`, `t` is still greater than 0, `a` is the same list of unique integers, `aa` is the same set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, and `cnt` is either the minimum count found during the loop or 0 if no match was found for `tmp` throughout the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
