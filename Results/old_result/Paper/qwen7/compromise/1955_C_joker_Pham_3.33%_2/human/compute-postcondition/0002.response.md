Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l <= r`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `sunks` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for it)
3. **Determine the requirement for the loop to execute the first time**: For the loop to execute, the condition `l <= r` must be true.
4. **Check the current values**:
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `n - 1`

Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `l <= r` is already satisfied as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `l` and `r`.

**Conclusion**: The loop can execute the first time without any adjustments to the given states.

**Answer**:
State: **`l` is 0, `r` is n - 1**
