Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an integer equal to `len(rev_val)`, meaning `x` is the length of the list `rev_val`.
- `rev_val` remains unchanged as a list.
- `rev_res` is an empty string initially.

The code snippet does not modify any of these variables and only contains a `print('Sasha')` statement.

Therefore, the `print` statement will simply output the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
