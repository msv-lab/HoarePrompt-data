Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer equal to 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `max_power` is less than or equal to 0, `list_len` is the first input value converted to an integer, `max_power` is the second input value converted to an integer, `operational_list` is a list created from the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is 0, `x_rev` is 0, and either `rev_res` is 0 or `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is either `x_rev` or 0 depending on whether the length of `str(x_rev)` equals the length of `x`. `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
