Postcondition: `rev_res` is a string that concatenates the integer representations of even-indexed elements from `rev_val` and the reversed versions of odd-indexed elements from `rev_val`, in the order they appear in `rev_val`. This holds true whether or not \(10^{int(max_power)}\) is less than `rev_res`.
