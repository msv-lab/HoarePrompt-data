Output State: **`rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string, `x` is incremented by 1, `val_in` is an integer extracted from `rev_val` at index `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value at index `x` of the list `rev_val` to the variable `val_in`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `rev_val` being a non-empty list, `rev_res` being a string, and `x` being incremented by 1.
