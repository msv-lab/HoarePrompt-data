Output State: **`rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and must not be empty, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer. This operation affects only the variable `x_rev`, which now holds the integer value of the reversed string `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
