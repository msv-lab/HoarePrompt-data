Based on the initial state provided:

- `rev_res` is a string that concatenates the integer representations of even-indexed elements from `rev_val` and the reversed versions of odd-indexed elements from `rev_val`, in the order they appear in `rev_val`.
- `max_power` is such that \(10^{int(max_power)}\) is less than `rev_res`.

The `print('Sasha')` statement simply prints the string "Sasha".

Output: **Sasha**
