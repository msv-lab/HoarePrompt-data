Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in operational_list:`. The variables involved here are `x`, `operational_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `rev_val` is an empty list.
   - `rev_res` is an empty string.
   - `list_len` is the length of the input string.
   - `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string.
   - `operational_list` is a list created from the split input.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `operational_list` is not empty. If `operational_list` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `operational_list` being non-empty, we need to ensure that `operational_list` is not empty at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `operational_list` must not be empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and must not be empty**
