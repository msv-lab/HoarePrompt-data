Output State: **`rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string matches the original string's length, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is an empty list after all elements have been processed, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x` for the current iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `rev_val` will contain the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original string. `rev_res` remains an empty string since no characters were appended to it throughout the loop. The `operational_list` becomes empty as all elements have been processed. `list_len`, `max_power`, and `x_rev` retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
