Output State: **`x` is an integer (x + 1), `rev_val` is a list, `rev_res` is a string with the additional character `val_in` appended, `val_in` is an integer equal to `rev_val[x]`**.

This means that the string `rev_res` has had the character corresponding to `val_in` (which is the value at index `x` in the list `rev_val`) appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
