Output State: **`x` is 0, `x_rev` is 0, `rev_res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x` (which is 0) to `rev_res`. Since both `x` and `rev_res` start as 0, adding 0 to `rev_res` does not change its value. Therefore, `rev_res` remains 0. The lengths of the string representations of `x_rev` and `x` remain equal, which they are, as both are 0.
