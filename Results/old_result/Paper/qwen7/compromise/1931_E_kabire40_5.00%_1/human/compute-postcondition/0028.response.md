Output State: **`len(rev_val)` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `rev_res` is a string containing the string representation of `val_in`, `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[0]`**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += str(val_in)` appends the string representation of `val_in` to the existing value of `rev_res`. Since `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[0]`, `rev_res` now includes this integer as a string. The length of `rev_val` remains unchanged, `x` is still 0, and `x` modulo 2 is still 0.
