Postcondition: `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is a string containing the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[0]`. If `x % 2 != 0`, then `rev_res` is equal to `val_in[::-1]`, where `val_in` is equal to `rev_val[0]`.
