Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `rev_val`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `val_in` (an integer extracted from `rev_val` at index `x`) to `rev_res`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise (`x % 2 != 0`), `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the value at index `x-1` in `rev_val` to `rev_res`, and `x` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `x` will be the current value of `x` plus 1.
   - The condition `x % 2` will determine how `rev_res` is updated, but the key point is that `rev_val` remains unchanged within the loop body.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- The variable `x` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- The variable `rev_val` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- The variable `rev_res` will depend on the value of `x % 2` and the operations performed inside the loop, but since we are asked to adjust the states before the loop starts, we don't need to specify the exact value of `rev_res` yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string, `x` is incremented by 1**.
