Postcondition: `x` is an integer equal to `len(rev_val)`, `rev_val` remains unchanged as a list, and `rev_res` is a string. For each index `i` in `rev_val`:
- If `i` is even, the string representation of `rev_val[i]` is appended to `rev_res`.
- If `i` is odd, the reverse of `rev_val[i]` is concatenated to `rev_res`.

This means that regardless of the condition `(10 ** int(max_power)) < int(rev_res)`, the final state of `x`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` will always follow the described rules for concatenating elements based on their index being even or odd.
