Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `operational_list`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`.
   - If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is updated by adding `x` to it.
   - Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `operational_list`, the variable `x` will be set to the next element in `operational_list`.
   - There is no direct modification of `operational_list` within the loop, so its state remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `x` will be the next element in `operational_list`.
   - The other variables (`x_rev`, `rev_res`, `rev_val`) will be reset to their initial conditions for the new value of `x`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in `operational_list` being processed.

**State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` is empty, `rev_val` is an empty list**.
