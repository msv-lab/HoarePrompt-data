Output State: **`x` is an integer (x + 1), `rev_val` is a list, `rev_res` is a string, `val_in` is an integer equal to `rev_val[x]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `rev_val[x]` to the variable `val_in`. Since `x` is an integer (x + 1), `val_in` will be an integer that corresponds to the element in the list `rev_val` at the index `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
