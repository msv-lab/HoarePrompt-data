Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0; `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. The values of `j`, `n`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` remain unchanged from their initial states.
