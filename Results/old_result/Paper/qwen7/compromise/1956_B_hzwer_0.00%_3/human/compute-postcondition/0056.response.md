Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `cards.count(j + 1)` is either 0 or 1, but now it is explicitly set to `dp[i + 1][j]` since the code only updates `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now specifically set to `dp[i + 1][j]`, while the conditions for updating `dp[i][j]` based on `cards.count(j + 1)` are preserved. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
