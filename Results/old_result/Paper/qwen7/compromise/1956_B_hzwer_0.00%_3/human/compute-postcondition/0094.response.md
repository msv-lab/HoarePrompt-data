Output State: The final state of `dp[i][j]` after the loop executes all its iterations will be determined based on the maximum value among the following conditions for each `j` in the specified range:

- If `j + 1` does not exist in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If `j + 1` exists in `cards` exactly once, then `dp[i][j]` will be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If `j + 1` exists in `cards` more than once, then `dp[i][j]` will be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

This final state reflects the maximum possible value that can be achieved for `dp[i][j]` after considering all possible updates from the loop's iterations, starting from the last iteration and moving backward.
