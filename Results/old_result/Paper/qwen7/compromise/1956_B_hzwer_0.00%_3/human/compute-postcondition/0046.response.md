Postcondition: `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `dp[i][j]` is calculated as follows: if the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 1, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is greater than 1, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
