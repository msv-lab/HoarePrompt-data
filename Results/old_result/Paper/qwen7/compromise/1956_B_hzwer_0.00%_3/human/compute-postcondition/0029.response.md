Output State: **`cards` is a list of integers, `dp[i][1]` is updated based on the following rules: if there is no occurrence of `2` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i][1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][1]`, `dp[i + 2][0] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][2]` if `cards.count(2) == 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i][1]` based on the presence of `2` in the list `cards`. If `2` does not exist in `cards`, `dp[i][1]` is set to `dp[i + 1][1]`. If `2` exists and its count is exactly 1, `dp[i][1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][1]`, `dp[i + 2][0] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][2]`. The initial conditions and the structure of `dp` remain unchanged except for the specific update rule applied to `dp[i][1]`.
