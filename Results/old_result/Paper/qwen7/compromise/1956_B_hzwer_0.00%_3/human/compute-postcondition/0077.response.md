Postcondition: `cards` is a list of integers. If `j + 1` does not exist in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` remains unchanged and is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` exists in `cards` at least once, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` (if there is exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`), and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` (if there is more than one occurrence of `j + 1`).
