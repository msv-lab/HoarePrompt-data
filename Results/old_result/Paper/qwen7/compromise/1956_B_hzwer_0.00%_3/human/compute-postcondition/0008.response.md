Output State: **`cards` is a list of integers; the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0; `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`**.

The code updates `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `dp`, so we only know that `dp[i][j]` now holds the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. The list `cards` and its condition remain unchanged.
