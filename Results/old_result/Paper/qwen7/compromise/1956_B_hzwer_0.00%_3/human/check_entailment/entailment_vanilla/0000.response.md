Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a card game where two players (you and Nene) take turns placing cards on a table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. We need to calculate the maximum number of points you can get.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to solve the problem.
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score you can achieve when you have `i` cards left and Nene has `j` points.
   - The outer loop iterates backward from `n-3` to `0`, representing the remaining cards in your hand.
   - The inner loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`, representing the possible points Nene could have after your current turn.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - If a card value `j+1` is not in your hand (`cards.count(j + 1) == 0`), the next state is simply the previous state (`dp[i + 1][j]`).
   - If a card value `j+1` is in your hand once (`cards.count(j + 1) == 1`), you have two choices:
     - Skip the card and let Nene potentially gain a point (`dp[i + 1][j]`).
     - Use the card and force Nene to lose a point (`dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`).
   - If a card value `j+1` is in your hand twice (`cards.count(j + 1) == 2`), you have three choices:
     - Skip the card and let Nene potentially gain a point (`dp[i + 1][j]`).
     - Use one card and force Nene to lose a point (`dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`).
     - Use both cards and force Nene to lose two points (`dp[i + 1][j + 1]`).

4. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[n - 1][0] = 0` and `dp[n - 2][0] = 0` handle the base cases where you have only one or two cards left and Nene has zero points.

5. **Final Result**:
   - `dp[0][0]` gives the maximum score you can achieve when all cards are played.

6. **Optimality**:
   - The logic ensures that Nene plays optimally by considering the worst-case scenario for you while maximizing her own score.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to find the maximum number of points you can get under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
