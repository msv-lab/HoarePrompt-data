Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `results` is a list containing 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration. Specifically, if `n` (an integer input) is even, 'no' is appended; otherwise, if the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended; otherwise, 'no' is appended.
