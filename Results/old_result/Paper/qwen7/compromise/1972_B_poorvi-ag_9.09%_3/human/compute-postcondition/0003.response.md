Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `results` is a list containing 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration. Specifically, if `n` (the input integer for each iteration) is even, the result is 'no'. If `n` is odd and the string `arr` contains more 'U's than 'D's, the result is 'yes'; otherwise, the result is 'no'.
