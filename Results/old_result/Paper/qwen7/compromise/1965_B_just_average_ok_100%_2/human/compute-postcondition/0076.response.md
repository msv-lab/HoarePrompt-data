Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 19, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, k + 1].**

The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Since `k` is greater than 0, `k + 1` will be a positive integer greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
