Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `i` is 2, `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the list `nums` and increments `i` for each iteration. The loop breaks when it finds an element in `nums` that is greater than `k`. Based on the provided information, the loop breaks when `i` is 2 (since `nums[2]` is 64, which could be greater than `k`), setting `idx` to `i - 1`, which is 1. After the loop completes, `i` remains 2 and `idx` remains 1, unless `nums[2]` is not greater than `k`, in which case `i` would still be 2 but `idx` would remain -1. However, since the problem indicates that `idx` is set to `i - 1` upon breaking, `idx` will be 1 regardless of whether `nums[2]` is greater than `k` or not.
