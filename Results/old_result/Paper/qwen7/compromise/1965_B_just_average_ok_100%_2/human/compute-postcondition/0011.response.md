The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(nums)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `idx` is -1. The loop condition for the `for` loop is `i < len(nums)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 1.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is 1. We need to check if `i` is still within the bounds of `len(nums)` to determine if the loop should continue. However, the state of `idx` does not change within the loop head, and it is not directly affected by the loop itself. Thus, we do not need to adjust `idx`.

State: **`i` is 1, `idx` is -1**
