Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 19, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]**.

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since the initial state of `idx` was set to `i - 1`, which is 20, and the code simply contains a `break` statement, `idx` is updated to 19 (as per the initial condition), and no other changes occur to the variables.
