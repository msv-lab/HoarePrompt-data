Postcondition: `i` is 21, `idx` is 20, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `nums[i]` is not greater than `k`, no specific action is taken, and the variables retain their original values.
