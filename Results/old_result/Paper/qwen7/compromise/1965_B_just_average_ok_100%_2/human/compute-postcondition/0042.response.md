Output State: **`i` is either `idx + 2` where `idx` is `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `i` remains unchanged and we do not break out of the loop or if statement because `nums[i] <= k`; `idx` is `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = i - 1` assigns the value of `i - 1` to the variable `idx`. This does not affect the value of `i` itself, which remains either `idx + 2` (where `idx` is `i - 1`) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `i` remains unchanged and we do not break out of the loop or if statement because `nums[i] <= k`. Therefore, `idx` is updated to `i - 1`.
