Output State: `i` is 20, `idx` is 19, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.

This output state occurs when the loop iterates through all elements in the list `nums`. Since the loop increments `i` from 0 to 20 (as `len(nums)` is 21), it checks each element against `k`. If any `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, the loop breaks, setting `idx` to `i - 1`. In this case, the loop does not break until the last iteration, meaning `i` reaches the end of the list (`len(nums) - 1`), and `idx` is set to the last index before the break condition was met.
