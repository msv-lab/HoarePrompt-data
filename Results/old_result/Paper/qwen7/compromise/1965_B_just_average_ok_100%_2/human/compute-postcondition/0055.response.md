Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 21, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged, and `k` must still be greater than 0 as per the initial condition. The exact values of `n` and `k` depend on the user's input, but they are now stored in these variables.
