Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `idx` is -1, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `nums[i] > k`.**
