Output State: **`i` is 2, `idx` is 1, `nums` is a list with elements [2, k - nums[1], k + 1]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Initially, `nums` contains `[2, k - nums[1]]`. After appending `k + 1`, `nums` becomes `[2, k - nums[1], k + 1]`. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged.
