Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find a sequence `a` of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All numbers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The code generates a list `nums` containing powers of 2 from \(2^{0}\) to \(2^{20}\).
   - It then appends three specific values related to `k`: `k - 2^{idx}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{idx} + 1`, and removes `2^{idx}`.
   - The list `nums` is then printed along with its length.

3. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**: The constructed list `nums` does not include `k`. Since the only way to get `k` would be through the combination of the appended values, which do not directly form `k`, this condition is satisfied.
   - **Subsequences Summing to All Numbers Except `k`**: The list `nums` includes all necessary powers of 2, allowing for the construction of any sum from 1 to `n` except `k`. The appended values ensure that the missing `k` can be compensated by other combinations.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the maximum possible value for `n` (up to \(10^6\)) and ensures the sequence length is within the limit of 25.

5. **Execution Summary**:
   - The provided execution summary correctly describes the steps taken by the function, confirming that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
