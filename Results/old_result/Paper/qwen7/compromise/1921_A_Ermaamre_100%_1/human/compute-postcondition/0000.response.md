Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This integer is stored in the variable `t`. The initial values of `x_i` and `y_i` for each test case are not yet known as they will be read in subsequent lines within each test case. However, it is mentioned that the coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, which remains a precondition. The value of `t` is updated to reflect the number of test cases, and no other variables are affected by this line of code.
