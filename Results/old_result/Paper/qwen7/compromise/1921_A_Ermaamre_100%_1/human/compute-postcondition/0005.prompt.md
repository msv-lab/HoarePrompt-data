You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. It is guaranteed that these points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, a 4x2 matrix `a` is read from input, and `dx` is calculated as the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the first column of `a`. The result `dx * dx` is printed for each iteration. After all iterations, the final value of `t` remains unchanged, but the printed output consists of the computed `dx * dx` values for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It returns whether the given points form a valid square with a positive area.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
