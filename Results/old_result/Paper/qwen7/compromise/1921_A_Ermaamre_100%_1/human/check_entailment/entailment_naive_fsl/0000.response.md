Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The logic to find the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and compute the difference (which represents the side length of the square) and then squaring this difference to get the area is sound. Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem description, the program will work correctly for all valid inputs. There are no edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to fail based on the provided problem statement and examples.
