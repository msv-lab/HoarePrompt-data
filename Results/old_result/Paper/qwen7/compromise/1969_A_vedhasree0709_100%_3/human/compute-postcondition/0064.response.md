Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is set to 3.
   - `p` is assigned the value of `l[3]`.
   - `q` is assigned the value of `l[1]`.
   - `q` is then updated to `l[l[3] - 1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

From the initial state:
- `i = 3`.
- `p = l[3]`.
- `q = l[1]`.
- After updating, `q = l[l[3] - 1]`, which means `q = l[3 - 1] = l[2]`.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer 2.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **2**
