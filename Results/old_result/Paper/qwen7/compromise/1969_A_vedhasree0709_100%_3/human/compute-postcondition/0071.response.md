Output State: `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[p - 1]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have incremented until it reaches `n`. Since the loop breaks when `q` equals `i + 1`, `j` is set to 1 and the loop terminates. The values of `p` and `q` will be based on the final value of `i`, which is `n - 1`. Therefore, `p` will be `l[n-1]` and `q` will be `l[p - 1]`, which is `l[n-2]`. However, since the exact values of `p` and `q` are not required to be specified unless they change due to the loop's execution, we can simply state that `p` is `l[n-1]` and `q` is `l[p - 1]`.
