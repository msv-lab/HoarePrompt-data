Output State: **`i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[1]`; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the implied innermost structure.
