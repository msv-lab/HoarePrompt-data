Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 2 of list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`, `q` is assigned the value of the element at index `p - 1` in list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `q = l[p - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `p - 1` in list `l` to variable `q`. Since `p` is the integer at index 2 of list `l`, `q` is now assigned the value of the element at index `2 - 1` (which is index 1) of list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
