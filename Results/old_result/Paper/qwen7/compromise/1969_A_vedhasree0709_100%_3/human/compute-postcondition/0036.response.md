Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 4.
- `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- `j` is 1.
- `p` is the integer at index 3 of list `l`.
- `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`.
- If `q == i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- The condition `j == 0` is true.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print(3)` statement:

1. The value of `j` is explicitly stated as 1, which does not satisfy the condition `j == 0`.
2. Since `j` is not 0, the condition `if q == i + 1:` would not be checked because the `print(3)` statement is outside any conditional block involving `j`.

Therefore, the `print(3)` statement will execute and print the number 3.

Output: **3**
