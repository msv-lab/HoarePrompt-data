Output State: `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1]-1]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. Since the loop breaks when `j` is set to 1 and `q` equals `i + 1`, and given that the loop executes up to 3 times as per the provided states, we can infer that `j` will be set to 1 before `i` reaches `n`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `j` will remain 1, `p` will be `l[n-1]`, and `q` will be `l[l[n-1]-1]`.
