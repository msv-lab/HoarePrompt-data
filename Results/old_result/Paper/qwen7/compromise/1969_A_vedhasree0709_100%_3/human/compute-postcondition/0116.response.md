Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that the element at index `p[i]` minus one equals `i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and stops processing further test cases. If no such index is found after checking all elements, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.**
