Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1]-1]`.**

Explanation: Given the if condition `j == 0` does not hold (since `j` remains 1 after the loop), the else part does not execute. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition, where `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-1]`, and `q` is `l[l[n-1]-1]`.
