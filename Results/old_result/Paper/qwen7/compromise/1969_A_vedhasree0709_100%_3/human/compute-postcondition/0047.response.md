Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is the integer at index 0 of list `l`.
- `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`.
- `q` is equal to `i + 1`.

The `print(2)` statement directly prints the integer 2 without referencing any of the other variables or their values.

Output: **2**
