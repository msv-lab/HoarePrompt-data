Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and then converts each element to an integer. The resulting list of integers is stored in the variable `l`. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial state as an input integer.
