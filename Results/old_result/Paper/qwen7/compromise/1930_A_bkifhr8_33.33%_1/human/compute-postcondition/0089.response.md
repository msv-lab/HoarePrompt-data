Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is the original `ans` plus the minimum of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and `lst` has had its second element (index 1) removed.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `1 * 2`, which is index 2, from the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still less than `n * 2`, `n` is still an input integer, `ans` is still the original `ans` plus the minimum of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and `lst` now has its second element removed.
