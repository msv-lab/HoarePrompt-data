Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive); `ans_f` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans_f` contains the last computed value of `ans`, and `ans` is the sum of all minimum values between pairs of elements taken from the list `lst`, until the list `lst` has less than 2 elements left or the loop completes all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `2 * n`, `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans`, and `ans` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from the list `lst` until the list cannot be split into pairs or the loop has completed its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans_f` contains the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs from the list `lst`, and `i` is equal to `n * 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
