Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is either the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1]) - 1`, or `0 + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, depending on whether the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `i` remains 0 and `n` remains a positive integer. If the length of `lst` is 2, `i` remains 0 and `n` remains a positive integer, with `ans` being updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is either the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1]) - 1`, or `0 + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, depending on whether the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is further adjusted by adding `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. Additionally, if `i` is 0, and `lst` has lost its second element, `ans` is further incremented by `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. If `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, `ans` remains as previously calculated, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` remains the same as the previous iteration, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` (converted to integers), and `lst` is modified by removing the element at index 0, unless the length of `lst` is 2, in which case `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
