Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` added to its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the second element of `lst` has been removed at index 1.
