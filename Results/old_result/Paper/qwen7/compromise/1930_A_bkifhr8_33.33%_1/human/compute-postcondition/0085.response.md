Postcondition: `i` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is increased by the minimum value between the elements of `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has one element less and the first element at index 0 is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.
