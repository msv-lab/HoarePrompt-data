Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < t`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `ans_f` contains the last computed value of `ans`.
   - `ans` is the sum of all minimum values between pairs of elements taken from the list `lst`, until the list `lst` has less than 2 elements left or the loop completes all iterations.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `t` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`. The new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. 

Since no other information about `t` is provided, we assume it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `ans_f` contains the last computed value of `ans`.
- `ans` is the sum of all minimum values between pairs of elements taken from the list `lst`, until the list `lst` has less than 2 elements left or the loop completes all iterations.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `t` remains the same.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`ans_f` contains the last computed value of `ans`, `ans` is the sum of all minimum values between pairs of elements taken from the list `lst`, until the list `lst` has less than 2 elements left or the loop completes all iterations, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` remains the same**.
