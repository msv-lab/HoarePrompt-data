Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans_f` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is equal to another element in `ans_f`.

The print statement `print(i)` will print the value of `i`, which is an element in `ans_f`.

Since `ans_f` contains at least one element and `i` is set to be equal to one of these elements, `i` could be any one of those elements. However, without knowing the specific value of `i`, we can only say that `i` is an element from `ans_f`.

Output: **an element from ans_f**
