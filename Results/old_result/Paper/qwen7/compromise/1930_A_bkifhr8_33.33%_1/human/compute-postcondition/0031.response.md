Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` remains the same as the previous iteration; `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
