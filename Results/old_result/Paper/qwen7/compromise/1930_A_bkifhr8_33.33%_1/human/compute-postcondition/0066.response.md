Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `ans`. The initial conditions and the expression for `ans` remain unchanged.
