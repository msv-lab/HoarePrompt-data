Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is either the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1]) - 1`, or `0 + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, depending on whether the length of `lst` is not 2.
   - If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is further adjusted by adding `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
   - If `i` is 0, and `lst` has lost its second element, `ans` is further incremented by `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
   - If `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, `ans` remains as previously calculated, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n * 2):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`
   - `n`

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n * 2`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is the variable that controls the loop, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

6. **Calculating the New Values:**
   - If `i` was 0 before the loop started, after one iteration, `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

7. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` remains the same as the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is either the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1]) - 1`, or `0 + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, depending on whether the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is further adjusted by adding `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. Additionally, if `i` is 0, and `lst` has lost its second element, `ans` is further incremented by `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. If `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, `ans` remains as previously calculated, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `i` is 1, `n` is the same as the previous iteration.**
