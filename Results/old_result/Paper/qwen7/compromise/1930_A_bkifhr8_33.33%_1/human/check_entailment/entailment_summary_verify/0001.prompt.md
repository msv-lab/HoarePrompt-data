You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t (number of test cases) and an integer n (number of pairs of integers), along with 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs from the list of integers and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum from the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an empty list `ans_f` to store the results for each test case.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0 for each test case to accumulate the score.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the list of integers as a string and splits it into individual integers.
   - It then iterates through the list to perform the operations:
     - If there are still at least 2 elements in the list, it adds the minimum of the first two elements to the score (`ans`).
     - It removes the first two elements from the list.
     - If there are less than 2 elements left, it breaks out of the loop since no more pairs can be formed.
   - After processing all pairs, it appends the final score (`ans`) to `ans_f`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the scores for each test case.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect List Removal Logic:**
   - The logic for removing the first two elements from the list is flawed. The current implementation uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which will remove the same element twice and then try to remove an invalid index, leading to incorrect behavior.

2. **Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - The current logic does not handle the case where the list has an odd number of elements correctly. When the list length is odd, the last element should not be removed but used in the next pair formation.

### Corrected Implementation:

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the list is processed correctly and pairs are formed optimally. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = 0
        while len(lst) > 1:
            # Form the pair and add the minimum to the score
            ans += min(lst[0], lst[1])
            # Remove the used elements
            lst.pop(0)
            lst.pop(0)
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical errors in how it processes the list and removes elements. The corrected version ensures that pairs are formed optimally and the list is processed correctly.

Correctness: **False**
