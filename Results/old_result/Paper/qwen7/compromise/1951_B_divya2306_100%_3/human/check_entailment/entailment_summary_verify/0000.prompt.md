You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and finds the maximum number of elements in `a` that are greater than the `k-th` smallest element in `a`. If swapping the `k-th` smallest element with another element in the list increases the count of such elements, it considers this swap. The function then prints the maximum possible count of elements greater than the `k-th` smallest element, either before or after a potential swap, and returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of wins for cow `k` is flawed.

Let's analyze the provided solution:

1. The program attempts to calculate the initial number of wins (`wins`) for cow `k` without any swaps.
2. If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `wins - 1`.
3. Otherwise, it calculates `win_with_swap`, which is supposed to represent the number of wins if a swap is made, but this calculation is incorrect.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

### Issue 1: Incorrect Calculation of Initial Wins
The program calculates the initial number of wins by iterating through the list and counting how many elements are less than `a[k-1]`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the cow at position `i` will play against the cow at position `i+1` if it wins.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Calculation of Wins After Swap
The program tries to calculate the number of wins if a swap is made, but it does not handle the scenario correctly. Specifically, it should consider the position of the cow with the highest rating among the cows that could potentially be swapped into position `k`.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Identify the cow with the highest rating among the cows that could potentially be swapped into position `k`.
2. Determine the number of wins if no swap is made.
3. Determine the number of wins if a swap is made, considering the new position of the cow with the highest rating.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Find the cow with the highest rating among the cows that could potentially be swapped into position k
    max_rating = max(a[:k-1] + a[k:])
    max_index = a.index(max_rating)

    # Calculate the initial number of wins without any swap
    wins_without_swap = 0
    for i in range(k-1):
        if a[i] > a[k-1]:
            break
        wins_without_swap += 1

    # Calculate the number of wins if a swap is made
    wins_with_swap = 0
    for i in range(k-1, n-1):
        if a[i] > a[k-1]:
            break
        wins_with_swap += 1

    # Determine the maximum number of wins
    max_wins = max(wins_without_swap, wins_with_swap + (max_index < k-1))

    print(max_wins)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of wins for cow `k` by considering both the scenario without any swap and the scenario with a swap.
