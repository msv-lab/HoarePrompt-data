Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 7, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 3, 5]`, `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 7)]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(x / i)` to `output2`. Given that `i` is 7, `output2` now contains the integer division of `x` by 7. Since `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), the value of `int(x / 7)` will depend on the specific value of `x`, but it will be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
