Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `output2` as an empty list. Since `output1` was already an empty list in the initial state, and no other changes were made to `x` or `n`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, both `output1` and `output2` are now empty lists.
