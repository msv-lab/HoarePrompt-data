Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining how many possible values of \( k \) satisfy the given conditions for each test case. The key is to find all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) that are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It uses the `func_1` function to get all divisors of these values.
   - It filters these divisors to keep only those that are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - It ensures that each divisor is counted only once by converting the list to a set before getting its length.

3. **Review of `func_1` Function**:
   - The function correctly finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x`, checking for divisors and adding both the divisor and the quotient to the lists `output1` and `output2`.
   - It reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` to form the final list of divisors.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for filtering even divisors and ensuring they are greater than or equal to \( x \) is correct.
   - The use of sets to avoid duplicates is appropriate.
   - The overall approach to solving the problem is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
