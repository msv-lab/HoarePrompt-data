Postcondition: **`flag` is an integer, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is either '0' or '1'. If `flag` is 1, then the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', and either the character at index `i+1` is not '1' or `s[i+1]` does not exist. If `flag` is 0, then the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', and either the character at index `i+1` is '1' or `s[i+1]` exists.**
