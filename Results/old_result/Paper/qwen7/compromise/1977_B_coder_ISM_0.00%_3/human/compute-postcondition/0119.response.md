Output State: **`i` is 2, `30` is 30, `s` is a list containing '1'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Given the initial state where `s` is a list, after appending `'1'` to it, `s` becomes a list containing `'1'`. The values of `i` and `30` remain unchanged.
