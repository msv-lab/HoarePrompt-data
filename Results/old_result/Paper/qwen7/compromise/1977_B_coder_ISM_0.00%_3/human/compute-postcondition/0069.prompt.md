Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `flag` is 0, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `t` retains its initial value, `nalla` retains its initial value, and the list `s` contains 30 elements where each element is determined by the bitwise AND operation between `x` and \(2^i\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to 29.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `flag` is an integer, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is either '0' or '1'. If `flag` is 1, then the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', and either the character at index `i+1` is not '1' or `s[i+1]` does not exist. If `flag` is 0, then the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', and either the character at index `i+1` is '1' or `s[i+1]` exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `flag` is an integer, `i` is 29, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is either '0' or remains undefined. If `flag` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` remains unchanged. If `flag` is non-zero and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', the character at index `i` of string `s` is set to '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `flag` is an integer, `i` is 29, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is either '0' or '1'. If `flag` is 0 and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', the character remains '1'. If `flag` is 1, the character at index `i` of string `s` is set to '0'. If `flag` is non-zero and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', the character is set to '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
