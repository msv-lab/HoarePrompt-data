Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `t` retains its initial value, `nalla` retains its initial value, and the list `s` contains 30 elements where each element is determined by the bitwise AND operation between `x` and \(2^i\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to 29.**

Explanation: The variable `flag` is explicitly set to 0. The loop that constructs the list `s` has completed its iterations, setting `i` to 29. The variables `length`, `t`, and `nalla` are not affected by the code snippet provided, so they retain their initial values. The list `s` is constructed based on the given conditions, but the exact values within `s` are not specified in the provided code snippet.
