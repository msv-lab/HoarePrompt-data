Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means `t` now holds the number of test cases. The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified in the input yet, so they remain unchanged in terms of their range (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9), but their specific values are not known.
