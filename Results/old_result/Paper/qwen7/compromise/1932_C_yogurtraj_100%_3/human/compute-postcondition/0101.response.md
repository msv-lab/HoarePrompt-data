Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `q1`, `q2`, `k`, and `y` are undefined.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `q1`, `q2`, `k`, and `y` remain unchanged.
