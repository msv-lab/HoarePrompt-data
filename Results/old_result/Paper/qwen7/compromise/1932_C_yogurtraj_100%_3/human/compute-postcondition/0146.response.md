Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is -1.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `k` is the final value after all iterations based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `y` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - Each element from index `0` to `n-2` (inclusive) is updated to the value of `k` after each iteration.
   - `q1` and `q2` are adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop for each iteration.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*y)
   ```

Given that `y` is initially a list of `n` zeros and each element from index `0` to `n-2` is updated to the value of `k` after each iteration, let's determine the final state of `y`.

- Since `i` starts at -1 and `n > 2`, the loop will run until `i` reaches `n-1`.
- During each iteration, `k` is assigned a new value, and the elements from index `0` to `n-2` of `y` are updated to this new value of `k`.

After all iterations, `y` will have:
- The first `n-1` elements set to the final value of `k`.
- The last element (index `n-1`) remaining as 0 (since it is not updated).

Therefore, the final state of `y` will be a list with the first `n-1` elements being the same value (the final value of `k`) and the last element being 0.

Output: **[k, k, ..., k, 0]** (where `k` is the final value after all iterations and there are `n-1` elements with the value `k`)
