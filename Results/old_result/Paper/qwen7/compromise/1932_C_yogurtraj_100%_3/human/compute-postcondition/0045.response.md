Output State: **`k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`, `q1` is decreased by 1, `i` is `i-1` and must be greater than or equal to `0`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 2, the condition `t[i+1] == 'R'` is still false.**

This means that the value of `q1` has been decreased by 1, while the values of `k`, `y[i]`, `i`, `n`, and the condition `t[i+1] == 'R'` remain as they were before, except that `k` is now updated to `k * a[q1] % m`.
