Output State: **`k` is `a[l - 1] % m` and `q1` is `l - 2` if `t[-1] == 'L'`, otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and `q1` is `l - 1`; `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, and the last element of `y` is set to `k`**.

This means that the last element of the list `y` (i.e., `y[-1]`) is now equal to the value of `k`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
