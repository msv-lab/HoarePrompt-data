Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `-1` in reverse order. This means `i` starts at `n-2` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the state changes at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is updated based on the values of `a[q2]` or `a[q1]`.
   - `q2` is incremented by 1.
   - `q1` is decreased by 1.
   - `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
   - The condition `t[i] == 'R'` is still false.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` (one less than its current value).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `q2` is incremented by 1.
   - `q1` is decreased by 1.
   - `y[i+1]` will be assigned the value of `k` (which was updated in the previous iteration).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (one less than its current value).
   - `q2` will be `q2 + 1`.
   - `q1` will be `q1 - 1`.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
   - The condition `t[i+1] == 'R'` is still false.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `k` is updated to the value of `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `k` is updated to the value of `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1.
- `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
- The condition `t[i] == 'R'` is still false.

For the next iteration, the state should be:
- `i` is one less than its current value.
- `q2` is incremented by 1.
- `q1` is decreased by 1.
- `y[i+1]` is assigned the value of `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`k` is updated to the value of `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `k` is updated to the value of `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1; `y[i+1]` is assigned the value of `k`; `n` remains greater than or equal to 2; the condition `t[i+1] == 'R'` is still false.**
