Output State: **`i` is either `n-6` or `n-7`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m`, `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements `q1` by 1. The values of `i`, `k`, `y[i]`, and `a[q1]` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` is still either `n-6` or `n-7`, `k` is still updated as `k * a[q1] % m`, `y[i]` is still assigned the value of `k * a[q1] % m`, and `q1` is now one less than its previous value.
