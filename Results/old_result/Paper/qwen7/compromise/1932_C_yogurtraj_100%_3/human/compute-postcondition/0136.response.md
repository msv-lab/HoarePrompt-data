Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `n-2` to `-1` (inclusive). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1.

3. **Update the state of `i`**: Since the loop is iterating from `n-2` to `-1` in reverse order, at the end of the current iteration, `i` is either `n-4` or `n-5`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `n-6` or `n-7` respectively.

4. **Determine the new state of `k` and `y[i]`**: The values of `k` and `y[i]` depend on the value of `t[i]` and the conditions given. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we don't need to change `k` and `y[i]` unless explicitly stated by the problem constraints. In this case, no explicit changes are needed for `k` and `y[i]` as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is either `n-6` or `n-7`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'` and `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m` otherwise, `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`**
