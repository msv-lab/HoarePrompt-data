Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `t` is the next line of input, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`.**

Explanation: The code `l = t.count('L')` counts the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t` and assigns the result to the variable `l`. The values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged.
