Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 2, -1, -1` for the `range` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being `n - 2` and decrements `i` until `i` reaches `-1`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `n - 2` at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the value of `n`**: Since `i` is initialized to `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute. If `n` is 2 or less, the loop will not execute because `range(n - 2, -1, -1)` would not produce any values.

4. **Check other variables**: The variables `k`, `q1`, `q2`, `y`, `a`, `m`, and `t` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop executes. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` must be greater than 2

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 2**
