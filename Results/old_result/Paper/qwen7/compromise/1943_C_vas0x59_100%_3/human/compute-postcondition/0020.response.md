Output State: The loop will execute `n-1` times. After all iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `u` will be the first integer input decreased by `n-1`, `v` will be the second integer input decreased by `n-1`, and `u2vs[u]` will contain all vertices `v` that are connected to vertex `u` through an edge, and vice versa. This means `u2vs` will represent an undirected graph where each element in the list corresponds to the neighbors of the respective vertex.
