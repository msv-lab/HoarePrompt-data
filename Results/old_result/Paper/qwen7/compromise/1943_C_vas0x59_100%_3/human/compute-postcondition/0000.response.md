Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^3\) remains valid. The list `u2vs` is not modified by this code, so its state remains unchanged.
