Output State: **`n` is equal to the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block it was in, but it does not change the value of `n`. Therefore, `n` remains equal to the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.
