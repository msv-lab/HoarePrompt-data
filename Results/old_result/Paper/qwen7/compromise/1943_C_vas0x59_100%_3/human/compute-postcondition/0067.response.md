Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 4, `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than 4, `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 4)` and `(c2, 4)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 4, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c2, 4)`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
