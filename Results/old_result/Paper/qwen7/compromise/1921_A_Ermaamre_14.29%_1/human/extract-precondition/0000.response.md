Precondition: **The input is a series of test cases, each containing four lines with pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. Each coordinate pair (x_i, y_i) satisfies -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
