### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine if it correctly calculates the area of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.

2. **Identifying Opposite Sides**:
   - The program checks if the points form opposite sides of the square by comparing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
   - Specifically, it checks three conditions:
     - If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, it means the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x3, y3)` are on one vertical side, and `(x2, y2)` and `(x4, y4)` are on the other vertical side.
     - If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, it means the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are on one vertical side, and `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` are on the other vertical side.
     - If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, it means the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x4, y4)` are on one vertical side, and `(x2, y2)` and `(x3, y3)` are on the other vertical side.

3. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - For each condition, it calculates the absolute difference in the y-coordinates if the points are on the same vertical side, or the x-coordinates if the points are on the same horizontal side.
   - This approach correctly identifies the side length of the square.

4. **Area Calculation**:
   - The side length is then squared to get the area of the square.
   - This part of the code is correct if the side length is correctly determined.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    1 2
    4 5
    1 5
    4 2
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies the side length as 3 (which is the distance between y1 and y3 or x1 and x2), leading to the correct area of 9.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input:
    ```
    -1 1
    1 -1
    1 1
    -1 -1
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies the side length as 2 (distance between x1 and x2 or y1 and y2), leading to the correct area of 4.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input:
    ```
    45 11
    45 39
    17 11
    17 39
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies the side length as 28 (which is the distance between y1 and y3 or x1 and x2), leading to the correct area of 784.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly identifies the side length of the square in all cases due to the correct logic used to determine the side length. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
