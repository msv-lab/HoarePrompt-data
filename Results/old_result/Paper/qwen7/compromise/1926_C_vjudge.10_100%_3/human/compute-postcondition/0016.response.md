Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in str(i):`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Loop Head Variables**:
   - The state before the loop starts is given as `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`, and `sum_value_digits` is 0.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.
   - The loop variable `x` takes the value of each character in the string `str(i)`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on the string representation of `i`, the initial value of `i` needs to be considered.
   - The variable `sum_value_digits` is used in the initial state but is not directly involved in the loop itself. It is part of the initial condition and does not need to be adjusted within the loop context.
   - The state of `values` is not directly relevant to the loop itself, as it is not modified or referenced within the loop head.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is a non-empty string (since an empty string would result in no iterations).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i` to ensure it is a non-empty string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be a non-empty string**
