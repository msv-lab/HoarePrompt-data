Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `x` and `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Therefore, the loop continues as long as `i` is a non-empty string.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` must be a non-empty string.
   - `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of `i` (converted to integers) plus the integer value of `x`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is a string, and the loop iterates over each character, `i` will lose one character after each iteration until it becomes an empty string.
   - `x` in this context represents the current character being processed in the loop.
   - `sum_value_digits` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since no such modification is mentioned, it stays the same.

5. **Determine the New State**:
   - After processing one character from `i`, `i` will become a string with one less character.
   - `sum_value_digits` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now a string with one less character, and `sum_value_digits` remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be a non-empty string with one less character, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of `i` (converted to integers) plus the integer value of `x`.**
