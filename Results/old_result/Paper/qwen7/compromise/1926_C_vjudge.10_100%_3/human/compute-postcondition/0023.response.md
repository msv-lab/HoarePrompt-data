Output State: **The final value of `i` must be an empty string, and `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of the original `i` (converted to integers).**

Explanation: The loop continues to iterate as long as `i` is a non-empty string. Each iteration of the loop processes one character of `i` by adding its integer value to `sum_value_digits`. As the loop progresses, `i` loses one character each time until it becomes an empty string. At this point, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be an empty string, and `sum_value_digits` will hold the total sum of the digits of the original `i` (each digit converted to an integer).
