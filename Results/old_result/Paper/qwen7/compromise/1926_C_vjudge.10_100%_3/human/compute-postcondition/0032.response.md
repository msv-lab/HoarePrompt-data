Output State: **`i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is 3, `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Given that `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, since no specific value for `x` is provided, we assume it is intended to be added as is. If `x` was previously set to 2 (as a common example), then `sum_value_digits` would become 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
