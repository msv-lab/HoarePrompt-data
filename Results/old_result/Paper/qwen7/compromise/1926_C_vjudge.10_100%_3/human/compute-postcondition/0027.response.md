Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in str(i):`. The variables involved here are `x` and `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial state given is `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is initially 1, `str(i)` is "1". Therefore, the loop will iterate once with `x` being '1'.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute with the given initial state. The key variable here is `i`, and we need to ensure that `i` is such that its string representation allows the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `sum_value_digits` is 0 (though this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition)
- `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`

Since the loop depends on the string representation of `i`, and `i` is already set to 1, the loop can execute as expected.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`**
