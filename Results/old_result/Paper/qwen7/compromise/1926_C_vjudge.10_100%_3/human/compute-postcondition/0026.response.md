Output State: **`i` is 1; `sum_value_digits` is 0; `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`**

Explanation: The line `sum_value_digits = 0` sets the value of `sum_value_digits` to 0. Since `i` was initially 1, and `sum_value_digits` was the sum of the digits of the original `i`, which is 1, setting `sum_value_digits` to 0 overrides this. The relationship for `values[i]` remains as `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`. Given `i` is 1, `values[1]` would be `values[0] + 0`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `values[0]`, we keep it as `values[0]` in the output state.
