Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (as specified in `range(1, inf)`).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue executing**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `inf` (which is 200001).

4. **Identify other relevant variables**: Other variables like `t`, `n`, `inf`, and `values` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i` to ensure the loop starts correctly and can execute.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `inf` is 200001**
