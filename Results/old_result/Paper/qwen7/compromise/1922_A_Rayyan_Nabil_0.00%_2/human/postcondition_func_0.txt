The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases to follow, and for each test case, three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) of equal length \( n \). It checks whether for every position \( i \) in the strings, either \( a[i] \) equals \( c[i] \) or \( b[i] \) equals \( c[i] \). If this condition holds for all positions in any test case, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
