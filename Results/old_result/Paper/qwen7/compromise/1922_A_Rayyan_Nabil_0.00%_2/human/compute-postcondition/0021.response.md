Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed (which is the same as the value of `n` provided initially), `i` is `n-1`, and `l` is 'YES' if for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, both `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]`. If there exists any index `j` where either `a[j]` equals `c[j]` or `b[j]` equals `c[j]`, then `l` remains 'NO'.
