Output State: `i` is `n`, `t` is `n-2`, `l` is 'YES', `b` is an input from the user, `c` is an input from the user.

This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `t` remains `n-2` because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `l` is set to 'YES' if any element in the array satisfies the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` during the loop's execution. Since the loop does not change `l` once it is set to 'YES', `l` will remain 'YES' if the condition was met at least once. The variables `b` and `c` remain unchanged as they are inputs and not modified by the loop.
