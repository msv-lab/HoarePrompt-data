Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `0`, `l` is 'YES', `b` is an input from the user, `c` is an input from the user.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `t` will be `0` because it is decremented by `1` in each iteration of the outer loop until it reaches `0`. The variable `l` will be 'YES' if any element in the array satisfies the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` during the loop's execution. Since the loop does not change `l` once it is set to 'YES', `l` will remain 'YES' if the condition was met at least once. The variables `b` and `c` remain unchanged as they are inputs and not modified by the loop.
