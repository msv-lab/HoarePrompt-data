Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `n-2`, `l` is 'YES', `b` is an input from the user, `c` is an input from the user**

The code `l = 'YES'` simply reassigns the variable `l` to the string `'YES'`. Since the initial state already had `l` as `'YES'`, there is no change in the value of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
