Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers representing the array. After processing, the function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, where each element in `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration, with the last `i` elements removed from the original `elements` list for each iteration.**
