Output State: **`pos` is an empty list, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers representing the array.**

In this code, the variable `pos` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged from their initial state.
