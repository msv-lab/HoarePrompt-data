Output State: **`pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers representing the array; `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `s2` as the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the `elements` list. The other variables (`pos`, `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
