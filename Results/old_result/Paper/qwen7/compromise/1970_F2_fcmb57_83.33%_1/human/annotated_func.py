#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a 2D list representing the field, where each element is a string of length 2. b is an integer representing the number of steps in the game.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing the sum of the first elements of lists `a` and `b` as the first element, and the sum of the second elements of lists `a` and `b` as the second element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list `a` where each element is a string of length 2, and an integer `b`. It returns a tuple where the first element is the sum of the first characters of the strings in list `a` and the integer `b`, and the second element is the sum of the second characters of the strings in list `a` and the integer `b`.
