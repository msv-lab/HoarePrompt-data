Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically, for each pair (a, b) entered, if both a and b are odd, or if a/2 equals b or b/2 equals a, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed. The number of 'YES' and 'NO' outputs will depend on the input values of a and b for each iteration from 0 to n-1.
