Reasoning:
The provided program logic needs to be analyzed to determine if it correctly identifies whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions \(a \times b\).

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` checks if both dimensions are odd. If both dimensions are odd, no matter how you cut the rectangle, you will end up with smaller odd dimensions, which cannot form a new distinct rectangle (since the problem states that rotations are considered the same). Therefore, this part is correct.

2. **Special Case Check**: The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other. In this case, cutting the rectangle along the larger dimension results in two identical smaller rectangles, which cannot form a new distinct rectangle. This part is also correct.

3. **General Case**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'YES', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed. However, the program does not actually check if the resulting rectangles can form a new distinct rectangle. It only checks the initial dimensions and certain special cases. This means the program might incorrectly print 'YES' for some cases where a new distinct rectangle cannot be formed.

For example, consider the test case \(2 \times 6\):
- Cutting it into \(2 \times 3\) and \(2 \times 3\) can indeed form a new rectangle \(4 \times 3\).
- But the program would also incorrectly print 'YES' for \(3 \times 3\) and \(3 \times 3\) (which are the result of cutting an odd-by-odd rectangle), even though no new distinct rectangle can be formed.

Given the problem statement and the need to ensure that a new distinct rectangle can be formed, the current logic is insufficient. The program should include a more comprehensive check to ensure that the resulting rectangles can indeed form a new distinct rectangle.

Correctness: **False**
