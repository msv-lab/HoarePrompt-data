Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 1, `x` is 50000000, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000 and 99999999**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 using integer division. Given that `x` must not be 1 and must not be a value that would make it 1 in the next step, and considering its initial value was a large number (100000000), dividing it by 2 results in 50000000. All other variables remain unchanged.
