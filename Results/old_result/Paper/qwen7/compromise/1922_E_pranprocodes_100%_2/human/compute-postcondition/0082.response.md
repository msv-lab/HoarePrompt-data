Output State: `i` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. In each iteration, if `x` is even, `max` is decremented and `x` is halved; if `x` is odd, `min` is incremented and `x` is decremented. The loop terminates when `x` becomes 1. Given the initial conditions and the operations within the loop, `max` will eventually reach 99999997 (after being decremented from its initial value of 100000000) and `min` will stay at -100000000. The list `ans` will contain alternating values of `max` and `min` until `x` reaches 1.
