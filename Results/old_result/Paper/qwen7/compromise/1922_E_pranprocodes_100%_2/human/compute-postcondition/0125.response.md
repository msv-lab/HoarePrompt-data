Output State: `i` is 2, `t` is 100000000, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 repeated 50000000 times and -100000000 repeated 50000000 times.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Given the initial value of `x` is 2, the loop will run until `x` becomes 1 through the operations `x = x // 2` when `x` is even, and `x -= 1` when `x` is odd. Since `x` starts at 2 and is always even when it enters the loop (until it reaches 1), it will halve each time until it reaches 1. This means the loop will run exactly 31 times (since \(2^{31} = 2147483648\) and we start from 2, so it takes 31 divisions to reach 1).

For each iteration, the maximum value (`max`) decreases by 1 and the minimum value (`min`) increases by 1, with these values being appended to the list `ans`. After 31 iterations, `max` will be reduced by 31, making it -100000000, and `min` will increase by 31, making it 100000000. The list `ans` will contain 100000000 repeated 15 times and -100000000 repeated 15 times because the loop runs 31 times, and the values are alternated between appending `max` and `min`.

However, since the problem specifies the loop should run until `x` is 1, and given the constraints provided, the loop would theoretically continue indefinitely under normal circumstances without reaching 1. But based on the provided output states, it seems the loop is designed to run a fixed number of iterations, which is 100000000 in this case. Thus, after 100000000 iterations, `x` would be 1, `max` would be -100000000, `min` would be 100000000, and `ans` would contain 100000000 repeated 50000000 times and -100000000 repeated 50000000 times due to the alternating pattern.
