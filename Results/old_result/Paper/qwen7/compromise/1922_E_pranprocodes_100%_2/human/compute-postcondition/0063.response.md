Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 1, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with 100000000 appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `max` could be either 99999999 or 100000000, after decrementing by 1, it becomes either 99999998 or 99999999 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
