Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1. Since `x` is already 1, `t` must be 0 because no iterations are needed for `x` to become 1.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is calculated as `100000000 - t`. Given `t` is 0, `max` is `100000000 - 0 = 100000000`.
   - `min` is calculated as `-100000000 + t`. Given `t` is 0, `min` is `-100000000 + 0 = -100000000`.
   - `ans` is a list containing integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`, and it is reversed. Since `t` is 0, `ans` is a list from 100000000 to 100000000, which is just the single element `[100000000]`. Reversing this list still gives `[100000000]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(t)`.
   - Since `t` is 0, the print statement will output `0`.

Output: **0**
