Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1. Since `x` is already 1, `t` must be 0.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is 100000000 - `t`. Given `t` is 0, `max` is 100000000.
   - `min` is -100000000 + `t`. Given `t` is 0, `min` is -100000000.
   - `ans` is a list containing integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`. Since `t` is 0, `ans` is a list containing a single integer 100000000.
   - `ans` is reversed. Reversing a list with a single element does not change it.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

Given the above breakdown, the list `ans` contains a single element, which is 100000000. When `print(*ans)` is executed, it will print the elements of `ans` separated by a space.

Output: **100000000**
