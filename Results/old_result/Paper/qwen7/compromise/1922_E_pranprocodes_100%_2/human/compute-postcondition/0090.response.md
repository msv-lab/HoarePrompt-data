Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as an empty list, which means all elements of `ans` are removed, making it an empty list. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
