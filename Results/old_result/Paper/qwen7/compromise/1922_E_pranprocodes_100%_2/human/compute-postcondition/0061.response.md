The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is not equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` must still not be equal to 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `x` remains not equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 1, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000**
