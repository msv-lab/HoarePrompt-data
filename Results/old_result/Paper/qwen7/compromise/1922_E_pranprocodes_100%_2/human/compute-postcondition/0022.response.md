Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 1, `x` must not be 1 and must not be a value that would make it 1 in the next step, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000 and -99999999**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(min)` appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `min` is -99999999. After appending, the list `ans` now contains both 100000000 and -99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
