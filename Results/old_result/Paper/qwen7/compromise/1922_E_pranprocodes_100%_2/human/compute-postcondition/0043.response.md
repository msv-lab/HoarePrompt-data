Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, `ans` is a list containing integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`, and it is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `x`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
