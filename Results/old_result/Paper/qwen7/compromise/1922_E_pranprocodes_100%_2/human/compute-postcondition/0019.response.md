Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 1, `x` must not be 1 and must not be a value that would make it 1 in the next step, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000 and 99999999**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` (which is 99999999) to the list `ans`. The list `ans` originally contains the value 100000000. After appending, `ans` will contain both 100000000 and 99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
