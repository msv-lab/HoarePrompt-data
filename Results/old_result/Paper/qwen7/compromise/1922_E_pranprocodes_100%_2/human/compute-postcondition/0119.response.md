Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 2, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999997, `ans` is a list containing either -100000000, 100000000 or -99999999, 100000000**

Explanation: The code `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Since `min` was either -100000000 or -99999999, after incrementing by 1, it becomes either -99999999 or -99999998. All other variables remain unchanged.
