Output: **-100000000 -100000000 -100000000 ... -100000000 100000000 100000000 ... 100000000** (where the list `ans` contains -100000000 repeated 50000000 times followed by 100000000 repeated 50000000 times)

Explanation:
- `i` is 2.
- `t` is 100000000.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is -100000000.
- `min` is 100000000.
- `ans` is a list containing -100000000 repeated 50000000 times and 100000000 repeated 50000000 times.

When the `print(*ans)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces. Since `ans` contains -100000000 repeated 50000000 times followed by 100000000 repeated 50000000 times, the output will be as described.
