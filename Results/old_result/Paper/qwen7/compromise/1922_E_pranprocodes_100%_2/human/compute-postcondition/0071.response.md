The loop condition is `x != 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not be equal to 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is either 0 or 0.5. Since both 0 and 0.5 are not equal to 1, the loop can execute again without needing to adjust any other states.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 0.5, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with either 100000000 or -99999998 appended to it**
