Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 0.5, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with 99999998 appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Since `max` can be either 99999998 or 99999999, `ans` will contain either [100000000, 99999998] or [-100000000, 99999998]. The values of `i`, `t`, `x`, `min`, and `max` remain unchanged.
