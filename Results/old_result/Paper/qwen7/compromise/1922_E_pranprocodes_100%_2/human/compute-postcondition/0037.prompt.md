Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `t` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `t` is 1, `x` is either `x // 2` (if `x` is even) or `x - 1` (if `x is odd but not 1), `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 0, `t` is 2, `x` is either 50000000 or 99999999, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000 and either 99999999 or -99999999.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 0, `t` is 3, `x` is either 25000000, 49999999, 49999999, or 99999998, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999, -99999998, -99999998, or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000, 99999999, -99999999, or 99999999.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
