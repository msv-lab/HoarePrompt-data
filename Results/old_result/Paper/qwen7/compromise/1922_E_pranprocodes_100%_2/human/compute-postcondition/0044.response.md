Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, `ans` is a list containing integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`, and it is reversed.**

Explanation: The line `max = 100000000` updates the value of `max` to 100000000. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
