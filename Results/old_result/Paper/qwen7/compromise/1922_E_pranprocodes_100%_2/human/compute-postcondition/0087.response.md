Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of 99999997 and -100000000 and is reversed.**

The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
