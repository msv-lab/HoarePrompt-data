Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of 99999997 and -100000000. The list `ans` is reversed.**

Explanation: The loop has already terminated with `x` becoming 1, so the values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. The values of `max` and `min` also remain unchanged. The list `ans` contains alternating values of `max` and `min`, which means it starts with 100000000, followed by -100000000, and so on, until `x` becomes 1. After reversing the list, the order of elements in `ans` is reversed, so it now starts with 99999997, followed by -100000000, and so on.
