You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the number of steps (`t`) required to reduce an integer `x` (with constraints 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18) to 1 by either dividing it by 2 if even or decrementing it by 1 if odd. It also constructs a list `ans` containing alternating values of a maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) integer initialized to 100000000 and -100000000 respectively, and prints both `t` and `ans`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the total number of steps and the constructed list for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The program attempts to construct this array using a binary-like approach where each element is either the maximum or minimum possible value within the specified range.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - The program initializes `max` and `min` to represent the upper and lower bounds of the allowed values for the array elements.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly halve `x` (which represents the target number of increasing subsequences) until `x` becomes 1.
   - For each iteration, if `x` is even, it appends the current `max` value to the answer list and decrements `max`. If `x` is odd, it appends the current `min` value and increments `min`.
   - This process effectively constructs a binary-like sequence where each bit represents whether to use the maximum or minimum value.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `x` is 1, the program should output an array of length 1 with the middle value (0) since there's only one way to have exactly 1 increasing subsequence.
   - If `x` cannot be reduced to 1 through the described process, the program should output `-1`.

4. **Testing the Program**:
   - For `X = 2`, the program should output `[0]` because there's only one way to have exactly 2 increasing subsequences (an empty subsequence and a single-element subsequence).
   - For `X = 5`, the program should output `[0, 1, 0]` because it can be verified that this array has exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
   - For `X = 13`, the program should output `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` which indeed has 13 increasing subsequences.
   - For `X = 37`, the program should output a valid array of length 7 with the correct number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case when `x` is 1.
   - The logic for appending `max` or `min` values is sound and ensures that the resulting array has the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - The reversal of the list before printing is necessary to maintain the correct order of elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
