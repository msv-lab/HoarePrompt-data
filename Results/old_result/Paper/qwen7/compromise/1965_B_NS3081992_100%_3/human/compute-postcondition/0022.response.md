Output State: **`ans` is [1, 2, 4, k + 1], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k + 1)` appends the value of `k + 1` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state of `ans` is `[1, 2, 4]`, after appending `k + 1`, the updated list is `[1, 2, 4, k + 1]`. The values of `b`, `k`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
