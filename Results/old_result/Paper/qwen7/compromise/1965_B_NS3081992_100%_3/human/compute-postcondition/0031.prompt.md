You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, and `n` is not equal to 2.
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`.
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `ans` is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 2`. For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Therefore, if `lk` is 3 (for example, if `k` is 2), the loop will run twice, appending `2 ** 0` and `2 ** 1` to `ans`, resulting in `[1, 2]`. However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `lk`, the general form is provided as `[1, 2, 4]` assuming `lk` is 3.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `ans` is [1, 2, 4, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** lk, 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.
        #
        #In this output state, the list `ans` has been extended with additional elements. Specifically, starting from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    #State: Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` equals 1, then `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, `ans` is extended to include elements from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns the length of ans followed by its elements separated by spaces. The length and elements depend on the conditions given for k and the binary representation of n and k.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or the length of a list followed by its elements separated by spaces. The specific return value depends on the conditions given for k and the binary representation of n.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns the length of ans followed by its elements separated by spaces. The length and elements depend on the conditions given for k and the binary representation of n and k.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
