Output State: **`ans` is [1, 2, 4, k + 1, 2 * k + 1], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.**

Explanation: The code appends `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. Since `k` is already defined, `2 * k + 1` is calculated and appended to the existing list `[1, 2, 4, k + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
