Output State: `ans` is [1, 2, 4, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** lk, 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.

In this output state, the list `ans` has been extended with additional elements. Specifically, starting from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
