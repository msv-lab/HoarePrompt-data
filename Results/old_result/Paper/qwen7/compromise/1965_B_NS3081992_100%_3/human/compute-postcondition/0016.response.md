Output State: **`ans` is an empty list, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, and `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `k` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. None of the other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`, `bk`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
