Output State: `ans` is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 2`. For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Therefore, if `lk` is 3 (for example, if `k` is 2), the loop will run twice, appending `2 ** 0` and `2 ** 1` to `ans`, resulting in `[1, 2]`. However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `lk`, the general form is provided as `[1, 2, 4]` assuming `lk` is 3.
