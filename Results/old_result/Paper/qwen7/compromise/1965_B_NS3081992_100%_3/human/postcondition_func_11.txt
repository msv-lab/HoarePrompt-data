The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the maximum value in any list within `d`, an integer `da` which is a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum possible value of `da`. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1. Otherwise, it recursively updates the `processing` list and calculates the minimum value between the initial `tmp` (1000000000) and the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns this value.
