Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the provided code simply sorts the array and prints it. This does not maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition.

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. Specifically, we should place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end, and then alternate placing the next smallest and next largest elements in between. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        arr.sort()
        
        # Initialize the result
        max_beauty = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum beauty
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_beauty += abs(arr[i] - arr[i-1])
        
        print(max_beauty)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
