You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer \( n \) indicating the number of integers in the list. It then reads \( n \) integers for each test case, sorts them in ascending order, converts each integer to a string, and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string on a new line for each test case. The function implicitly accepts input through standard input and outputs results through standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and prints it, but this does not maximize the beauty of the array according to the given formula. 

To maximize the beauty, we need to arrange the array such that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are maximized. Sorting the array and simply printing it does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
3
100 54 80
```

Sorting the array gives us `[54, 80, 100]`, and the beauty calculated as \( (80 - 54) + (100 - 80) = 26 + 20 = 46 \).

However, the optimal arrangement would be `[100, 54, 80]`, which gives the beauty \( (100 - 54) + (80 - 100) = 46 + (-20) = 26 \). This shows that sorting alone does not achieve the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
