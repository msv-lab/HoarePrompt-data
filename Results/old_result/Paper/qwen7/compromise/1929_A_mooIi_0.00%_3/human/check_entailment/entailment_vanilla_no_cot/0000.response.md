Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to sort the array and then prints it, but this approach does not maximize the beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The beauty of the array is maximized by ensuring the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \) are maximized. Sorting the array and printing it does not achieve this.

To solve the problem correctly, you should rearrange the elements such that the largest element is paired with the smallest element to maximize positive differences and minimize negative ones. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Sort the array to easily pick the smallest and largest values
        ar.sort()
        # Calculate the maximum beauty
        max_beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(max_beauty)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements, which ensures the maximum possible beauty.
