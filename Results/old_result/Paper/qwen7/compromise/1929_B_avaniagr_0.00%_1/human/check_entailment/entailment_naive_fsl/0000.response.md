Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the program does not handle the case where `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`. According to the problem description, if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, Sasha needs to color all cells in the grid to ensure that all diagonals have at least one colored cell. However, the program incorrectly calculates this case.

For example, consider the following input:
- Input: `4 7`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Program Output: `4`

This case works correctly. However, consider the following input:
- Input: `4 8`
- Expected Output: `8` (all cells need to be colored)
- Program Output: `8` (which is correct in this specific case but the logic is flawed as it does not handle the boundary condition properly)

To correctly handle the boundary condition, the program should check if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2` and return `2 * n` in that case. The current implementation does not correctly handle this edge case, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
