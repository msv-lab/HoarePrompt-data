The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if \( k < 4n - 3 \), it prints \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \); if \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n \); and if \( k = 4n - 2 \), it also prints \( 2n \). The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated values for each test case.
