Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, considering Nene's strategy of maximizing her score while minimizing yours. However, the provided program simply counts the number of elements that appear at least three times in the input and divides this count by 3. This approach does not account for the strategic behavior of Nene or the distribution of cards between you and Nene.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  4
  1 1 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program will output `0` because there are no elements that appear at least three times in the input.

This example clearly shows that the program does not work as expected, as it fails to calculate the maximum number of points you can get based on the strategic behavior of Nene. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
