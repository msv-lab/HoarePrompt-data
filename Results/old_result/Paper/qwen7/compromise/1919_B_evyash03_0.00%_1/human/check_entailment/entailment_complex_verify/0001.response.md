### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the penalty calculation. Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to confirm this conclusion.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using the character `'-'` as a delimiter.
   - This means each part is a contiguous segment of `+` characters separated by `'-'`.

3. **Calculating Result Length:**
   - The variable `result_length` is set to the sum of the lengths of these parts.
   - This is a placeholder for the actual calculation of the minimum penalty, which is not used in the current implementation.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the `expression` and `result_length` as arguments.
   - However, the `result_length` parameter is not used within the function, which suggests it might be a mistake or an unused variable.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` counter to keep track of the net sum of `+` and `-` characters.
   - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` and resets the `balance` to zero.
   - Finally, it returns the `count` plus one if the `balance` is positive at the end.

### Detailed Analysis

Let's break down the function `func_1` more carefully:

```python
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
    return count + (balance > 0)
```

- **Balance Calculation:**
  - The `balance` starts at 0.
  - For each `+`, `balance` increases by 1.
  - For each `-`, `balance` decreases by 1.
  - If `balance` becomes negative, it means the current segment has more `-` than `+`, and we increment the `count`.

- **Counting Segments:**
  - The `count` keeps track of how many times the `balance` becomes negative.
  - After each negative `balance`, `balance` is reset to 0.

- **Final Adjustment:**
  - If the final `balance` is positive, it means the last segment has more `+` than `-`, and we add 1 to the `count`.

### Correct Penalty Calculation

The correct approach should involve calculating the penalty for each segment and summing them up. The penalty for a segment is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(expression):
    segments = expression.split('-')
    penalty = 0
    for segment in segments:
        sum_segment = sum(1 if char == '+' else -1 for char in segment)
        penalty += abs(sum_segment) * len(segment)
    return penalty
```

### Conclusion

The original function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the penalty. It only counts the number of times the balance becomes negative, which is not the same as the actual penalty calculation. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the penalty calculation.
