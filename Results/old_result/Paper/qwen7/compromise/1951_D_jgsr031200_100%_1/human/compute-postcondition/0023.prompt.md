You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns k (or n, since n equals k) as both are positive integers equal to each other and within the range of 1 to 10^18.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is greater than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, `n` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `costs`. The first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`. In each iteration, `curr` is set to `n` divided by the current element in `costs`, then `h` is incremented by `curr`, and `n` is decreased by `i * curr`. After the first iteration (`i = n - k + 1`), `n` becomes 0 because `n // (n - k + 1)` will be at most 1 (if `n` is just slightly larger than `k-1`) and subtracting `(n - k + 1) * 1` from `n` will make it zero. In the second iteration (`i = 1`), `curr` will be `n // 1`, which is 0 since `n` is now 0, so no changes are made to `h` or `n`. Therefore, `h` becomes the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, and `n` remains 0.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: 'NO'
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: Output:
    #State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, and `n` is 0. Regardless of whether `h` is less than `k` or greater than or equal to `k`, the final values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns `k` (or `n`). Otherwise, the function returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns k (or n, since n equals k) as both are positive integers equal to each other and within the range of 1 to 10^18.

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
