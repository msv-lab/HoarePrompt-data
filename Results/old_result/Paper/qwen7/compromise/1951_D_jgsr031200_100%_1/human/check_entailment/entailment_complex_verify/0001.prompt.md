You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `costs`. The first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`. In each iteration, `curr` is set to `n` divided by the current element in `costs`, then `h` is incremented by `curr`, and `n` is decreased by `i * curr`. After the first iteration (`i = n - k + 1`), `n` becomes 0 because `n // (n - k + 1)` will be at most 1 (if `n` is just slightly larger than `k-1`) and subtracting `(n - k + 1) * 1` from `n` will make it zero. In the second iteration (`i = 1`), `curr` will be `n // 1`, which is 0 since `n` is now 0, so no changes are made to `h` or `n`. Therefore, `h` becomes the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, and `n` remains 0.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: 'NO'
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: Output:
    #State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, and `n` is 0. Regardless of whether `h` is less than `k` or greater than or equal to `k`, the final values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1, then returns `k` (or `n`). If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, stores these values in `h` and `n`, respectively, and prints 'YES', 2, and the values of `costs`. Finally, it returns `None` if `h` is less than `k`, otherwise, it returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires setting up stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall in sequence until she cannot afford any more jewels in the next stall.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is defined to handle the logic for determining if it's possible to achieve `k` jewels.
   
3. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", 1, and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins and each jewel costs 1 coin, she can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is also correct because if Alice has fewer coins than needed to buy even one jewel, it's impossible.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost array `costs` and checks if the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from these stalls is at least `k`. If so, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls and the cost array. If not, it prints "NO".

4. **Stall Setup and Pricing**:
   - The program attempts to use only 2 stalls, which might not always be sufficient. However, the problem statement allows for up to 60 stalls, but the solution only uses 2 stalls.
   - The logic to determine if it's possible to achieve `k` jewels with 2 stalls is correct, but it doesn't explore other potential solutions involving more stalls.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the basic cases correctly but does not cover all edge cases, especially when more than 2 stalls are needed. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is close to `n`, the program might fail to find a solution with just 2 stalls.

### Conclusion:

The program is partially correct but incomplete. It only considers the simplest scenario of using 2 stalls and does not explore other possibilities. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.
