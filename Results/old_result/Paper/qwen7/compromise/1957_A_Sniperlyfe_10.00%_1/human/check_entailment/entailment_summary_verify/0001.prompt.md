You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates the frequency of each stick length in the list and returns the sum of these frequencies divided by 4.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into an array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(arr)` is defined to calculate the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr` and updates the frequency count for each stick length.

3. **Polygon Formation:**
   - To form a regular polygon, each polygon requires at least 3 sides of equal length.
   - The code calculates the number of complete polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon has 4 sides).
   - The `sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))` expression sums up the integer division results for all stick lengths, effectively counting how many complete polygons can be formed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where there are not enough sticks to form even a triangle (3 sides), which is correctly represented by the integer division result being zero.
   - However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks of the same length, which would also prevent forming a polygon.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `func_1` is sound for determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
- The code correctly counts the number of complete polygons by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4.
- The code does not explicitly check if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length before performing the division, but this is implicitly handled by the integer division operation itself (i.e., if there are fewer than 3 sticks, the division will result in 0).

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code appears to be correct. It accurately calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
