You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a stick length from the original list `arr`, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that stick length in the list.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where each frequency is the value associated with a stick length in the dictionary `freq`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates the frequency of each stick length in the list and returns the sum of these frequencies divided by 4.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where multiple polygons can be formed with different side lengths. For example, consider the input:

```
4
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```

According to the problem description, we can form a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4. However, the current implementation only counts the maximum possible number of polygons with the smallest side length (which is 2 in this case), and does not account for forming multiple polygons with different side lengths.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible side lengths and count the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with each side length, then return the maximum count among them.
