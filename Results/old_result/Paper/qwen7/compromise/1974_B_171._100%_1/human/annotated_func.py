#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is a unique character from `unique_chars` mapped to the corresponding character from the end of the list towards the start.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is created by mapping each character in `encoded` to its corresponding character in `char_map` from the end of the list towards the start.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded`. This is achieved by creating a mapping of each unique character in `encoded` to another character, specifically the one positioned at the opposite end of the sorted unique character list. The `decoded` string is then generated by applying this reverse mapping to each character in the original `encoded` string.
