Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to decode an encoded string based on the specified algorithm.
3. The function first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
4. It then maps each character in this list to its corresponding character from the end of the list.
5. Finally, it generates the decoded string by applying this reverse mapping to each character in the encoded string.
6. The logic within the function accurately implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
