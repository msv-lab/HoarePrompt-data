Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The `func_1` function:
   - Constructs a list of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - Creates a dictionary (`char_map`) that maps each unique character to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted list.
   - Uses this dictionary to decode the encoded string by replacing each character with its mapped value.
3. The logic in `func_1` accurately reflects the decoding process described in the problem statement.
4. The program handles multiple test cases as required.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
