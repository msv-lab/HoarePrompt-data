The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns the string `decoded`, which is created by mapping each character in `encoded` to its corresponding character in `char_map` from the end of the list towards the start.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a string `decoded` by mapping each character in `encoded` to its corresponding character in `char_map` starting from the end of the list.**
