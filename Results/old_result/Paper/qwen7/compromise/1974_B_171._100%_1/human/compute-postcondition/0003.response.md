Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len_unique`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, which starts at 0 in the first iteration.
   - `len_unique` is the length of the list `unique_chars`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len_unique`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, it needs to be set to 0.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len_unique` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len_unique`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len_unique` must be greater than 0**
