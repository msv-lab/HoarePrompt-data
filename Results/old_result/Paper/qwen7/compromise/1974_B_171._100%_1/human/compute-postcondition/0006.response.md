Output State: **`decoded` is a string created by mapping each character in `encoded` to its corresponding character in `char_map` from the end of the list towards the start, `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is a unique character from `unique_chars` mapped to the corresponding character from the end of the list towards the start.**

Explanation: The code creates a new string `decoded` by mapping each character in `encoded` to its corresponding character in `char_map`. This mapping is done from the end of the list `unique_chars` towards the start. The values of `len_unique`, `unique_chars`, and `char_map` remain unchanged.
