Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` creates a set from the string `encoded` to remove duplicate characters and then sorts this set. Since sets only contain unique elements, the resulting `unique_chars` will be a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted in ascending order. The length of `encoded` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
