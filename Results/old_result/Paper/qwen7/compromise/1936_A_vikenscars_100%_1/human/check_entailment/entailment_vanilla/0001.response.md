### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing \((p_a \mid p_b)\) with \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Approach Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly prints a query and reads the response.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the index with the highest single bit (most significant bit) set. This is done by iterating through indices and comparing \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
     - If \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i) < (p_i \mid p_i)\), update `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
   - **Step 2**: Find the index \(j\) that maximizes \(p_{max\_item\_idx} \oplus p_j\).
     - Compare \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx})\) with \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i)\) for each \(i\).
       - If \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx}) < (p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i)\), update `pair_idx` to \(i\).
       - If \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx}) = (p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i)\), further compare \((p_{pair\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) to decide the better candidate.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The approach in `func_2` might not always find the optimal pair of indices. Specifically, it only considers the most significant bit and does not fully explore the bitwise properties.
   - The logic for updating `pair_idx` might miss some optimal pairs if the bitwise properties are more complex.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided solution does not guarantee finding the optimal pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\). It focuses on the most significant bit but does not consider other bits or more complex bitwise operations.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure finding the optimal pair of indices that maximize the bitwise XOR operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: **False**
