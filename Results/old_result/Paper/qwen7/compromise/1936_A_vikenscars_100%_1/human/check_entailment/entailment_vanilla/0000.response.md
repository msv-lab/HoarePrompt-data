### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. We can ask up to \(3n\) queries to compare the results of bitwise OR operations.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The goal is to maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).
   - A key insight is that the maximum XOR value occurs when we have the highest bits set in both numbers.

3. **Strategy in the Code**:
   - `func_1` is used to make a query and get the result.
   - `func_2` is designed to find the index with the maximum value (using bitwise OR comparisons) and then find another index that maximizes the XOR with it.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function starts by finding the index `max_item_idx` with the maximum value using pairwise comparisons.
   - It then finds another index `pair_idx` that maximizes the XOR with `max_item_idx`.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The approach might not always correctly identify the pair with the maximum XOR. For example, if the permutation is such that the highest bits are not aligned in a way that maximizes XOR, the current logic might fail.
   - The logic assumes that the maximum value found initially will lead to the maximum XOR, but this is not necessarily true.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code does not guarantee that the pair found will indeed maximize the XOR. There could be permutations where the approach fails to find the optimal pair.
   - The code does not handle all edge cases and does not ensure that the maximum XOR is achieved.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not guarantee that it will find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
