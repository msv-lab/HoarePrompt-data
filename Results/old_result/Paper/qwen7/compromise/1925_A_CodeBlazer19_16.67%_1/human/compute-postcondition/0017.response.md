Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop condition).
   - `k` is 105.
   - `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
   - `j` is 106.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < t`, after one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < t` must still hold true. Since `i` is now 1, `t` must still be greater than 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 676\) but must be greater than 1.
- `i` becomes 1.
- `n`, `k`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `j` is 106**.
