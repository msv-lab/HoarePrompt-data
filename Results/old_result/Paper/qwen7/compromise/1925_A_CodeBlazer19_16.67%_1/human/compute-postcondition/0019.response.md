Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is an empty string, `j` is 106.**

Explanation: The line `s = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `s`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
