Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is 1.
- `s` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
- `j` is 106.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n * s)
```

Here, `n * s` means that the string `s` is repeated `n` times. Since the value of `n` is an input integer and no specific value for `n` is given, we will keep it as `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `s` repeated `n` times.

Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times**
