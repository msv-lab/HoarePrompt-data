Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'j', `j` is 107**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 107) to the string `s`. Since `s` initially contains the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 106 (which is 'j'), appending the character corresponding to 107 (which is 'k') results in the string 'jk'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged.
