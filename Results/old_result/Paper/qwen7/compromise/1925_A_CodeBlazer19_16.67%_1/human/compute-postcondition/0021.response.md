Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 106, `j` is 106**.

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 106) to the string `s`. Since `j` is 106, the character appended to `s` is the ASCII character for 106, which is the semicolon (';'). The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
