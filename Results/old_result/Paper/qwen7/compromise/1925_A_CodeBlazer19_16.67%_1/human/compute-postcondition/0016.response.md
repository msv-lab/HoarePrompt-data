Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `j` is 106.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Regardless of whether `k` is 1 or 105, the final values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `j` remain consistent as described.
