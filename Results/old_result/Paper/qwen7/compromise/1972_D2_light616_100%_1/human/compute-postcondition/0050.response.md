Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   \[
   (x + y) \times x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) \times y \leq m
   \]

2. **Current Values:**
   - \( x = 3 \)
   - \( y = 2 \)
   - \( n \geq 10 \)
   - \( m \geq 20 \)
   - \( cnt = 1 \)

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   Substitute the current values into the loop condition:
   \[
   (3 + 2) \times 3 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (3 + 2) \times 2 \leq m
   \]
   Simplify the expressions:
   \[
   5 \times 3 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 5 \times 2 \leq m
   \]
   Which simplifies to:
   \[
   15 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 10 \leq m
   \]

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - Since \( n \geq 10 \) and \( m \geq 20 \), both conditions \( 15 \leq n \) and \( 10 \leq m \) are satisfied.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute again.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - The loop can execute again because the current values of \( x \) and \( y \) still satisfy the loop condition.
   - We do not need to change the values of \( x \) and \( y \) since they are already within the required bounds.
   - We do not need to change \( n \) and \( m \) either since they are at least the required values.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop can certainly execute one more time with the current values, no adjustments are needed.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1**
