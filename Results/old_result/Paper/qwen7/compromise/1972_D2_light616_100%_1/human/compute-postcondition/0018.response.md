Output State: `x` is 1, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 5, `m` is at least 20, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` remains 1.

This output state is calculated based on the given loop and its conditions. The loop continues as long as \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\). Given that the loop has executed three times, we know \(x = 1\) and \(y\) starts from 2 and increases by 1 each iteration. After 3 iterations, \(y = 4\). For the fourth iteration, \(y\) would increment to 5. The conditions for the loop to continue also imply that \(n\) and \(m\) must be sufficiently large to satisfy the inequalities with \(x = 1\) and \(y = 5\). Specifically, \(n \geq 5\) and \(m \geq 20\) to ensure the loop can continue one more time with these values. Since the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` remains 1 throughout the loop, it will still be 1 after the loop completes.
