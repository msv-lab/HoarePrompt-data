Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 5, `m` is at least 20**.

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Initially, `x` is 1. After executing this line, `x` becomes 2. The values of `y`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this operation. Therefore, `y` is still 5, and the conditions for `n` and `m` (both being at least their initial values) still hold true.
