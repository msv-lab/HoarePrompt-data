Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `x` is 3
   - `y` is 1
   - `n` is at least 10
   - `m` is at least 20
   - `cnt` is 1 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition)

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with current values**:
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`: 
     \[
     (3 + 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12
     \]
   - Check if `12 <= n`: Since `n` is at least 10, this condition is satisfied.
   - Calculate `(x + y) * y`: 
     \[
     (3 + 1) * 1 = 4 * 1 = 4
     \]
   - Check if `4 <= m`: Since `m` is at least 20, this condition is also satisfied.

Since both conditions are already satisfied with the current values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 1, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20**
