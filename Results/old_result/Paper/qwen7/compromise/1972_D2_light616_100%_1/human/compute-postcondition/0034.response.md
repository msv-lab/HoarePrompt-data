To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head. The loop condition is:

\[
(x + y) * x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) * y \leq m
\]

Given the current state:
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( y = 3 \)
- \( n \) must be at least 5
- \( m \) must be at least 20
- \( cnt = 1 \)

Let's evaluate the loop condition with the given values:

1. Calculate \( x + y \):
   \[
   x + y = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]

2. Evaluate the first part of the condition \((x + y) * x \leq n\):
   \[
   (x + y) * x = 5 * 2 = 10
   \]
   Since \( n \) must be at least 5, this part of the condition is satisfied as long as \( n \geq 10 \).

3. Evaluate the second part of the condition \((x + y) * y \leq m\):
   \[
   (x + y) * y = 5 * 3 = 15
   \]
   Since \( m \) must be at least 20, this part of the condition is satisfied.

Since both parts of the condition are satisfied with the current values, the loop can execute one more time. However, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to maintain the conditions such that they remain true.

The variables involved in the loop condition are \( x \), \( y \), \( n \), and \( m \). We need to ensure that these variables' states allow the loop to continue executing.

- \( x \) and \( y \) are fixed at 2 and 3 respectively.
- \( n \) must be at least 10 to satisfy \((x + y) * x \leq n\).
- \( m \) must be at least 20 to satisfy \((x + y) * y \leq m\).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are \( n \) and \( m \) to ensure the loop condition remains true.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 20**
