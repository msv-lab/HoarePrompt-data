Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 1, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.**

The code `y = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `y`. All other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` is at least 10 and `m` is at least 20 is still valid.
