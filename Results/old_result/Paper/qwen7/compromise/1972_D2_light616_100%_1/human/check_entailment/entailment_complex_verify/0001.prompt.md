You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:

            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the product of n and m does not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is greater than or equal to 5, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will be incremented until the condition `x * x > n` is met. Since the loop stops when `x * x` exceeds `n`, and given that `x` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, `x` will be at least 5 when the loop terminates (as it was 4 after 3 iterations and would increment to 5 on the next iteration). The value of `y` remains 5 because the inner loop does not change it. The conditions for `n` and `m` ensure they are at least 10 and 20 respectively, as these were the minimum values required even after 3 iterations. The value of `cnt` remains 1 because the inner loop only increments `cnt` once, regardless of how many times the outer loop runs.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and \( n \times m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \). It then iterates over pairs of integers \( (x, y) \) starting from \( (1, 1) \) up to the point where \( x^2 > n \) and \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \). For each valid pair \( (x, y) \) where \( \text{gcd}(x, y) = 1 \), it increments a counter \( cnt \) by the minimum of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \). Finally, it prints the value of \( cnt \), which is guaranteed to be 1 based on the given constraints and logic. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and t equals 1 after all iterations of the loop have been executed, and func_1() has been called t times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then calls `func_1()` exactly `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Provided Code:
```python
import math

# Function 1: Main logic
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

# Function 2: Wrapper function to handle multiple test cases
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Calling the wrapper function
func_2()
```

#### Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it checks whether \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). This is done by checking if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is divisible by \(a + b\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Testing the Logic:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\): No pairs \((a, b)\) exist, so the output should be 0.
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\): The only pair \((1, 1)\) satisfies the condition, so the output should be 1.
   - For \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\): The pair \((1, 1)\) satisfies the condition, so the output should be 1.
   - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\): The pairs \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), and \((8, 8)\) satisfy the condition, so the output should be 6.

2. **General Case**:
   - The logic correctly checks for pairs \((a, b)\) where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) and ensures that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The use of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` ensures that the count does not exceed the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and testing the edge cases, we can conclude that the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
