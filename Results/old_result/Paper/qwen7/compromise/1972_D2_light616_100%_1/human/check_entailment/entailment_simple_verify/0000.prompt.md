You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the product of n and m does not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is greater than or equal to 5, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will be incremented until the condition `x * x > n` is met. Since the loop stops when `x * x` exceeds `n`, and given that `x` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, `x` will be at least 5 when the loop terminates (as it was 4 after 3 iterations and would increment to 5 on the next iteration). The value of `y` remains 5 because the inner loop does not change it. The conditions for `n` and `m` ensure they are at least 10 and 20 respectively, as these were the minimum values required even after 3 iterations. The value of `cnt` remains 1 because the inner loop only increments `cnt` once, regardless of how many times the outer loop runs.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 1

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and t equals 1 after all iterations of the loop have been executed, and func_1() has been called t times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Here's a brief breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a single test case. It iterates over possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x \cdot x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \leq m \). For each valid pair, it checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1. If so, it increments the count by the minimum of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case. There are no apparent edge cases or logical errors in the provided code that would cause it to fail for any valid input within the specified constraints.
