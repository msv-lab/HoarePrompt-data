Output State: All variables will reach their final states based on the loop's execution logic.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions will be true:

- The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.
- The variable `k` will be 0.
- The variable `b` will be the result of applying the permutation `p` to itself `t` times, starting from the initial value of `b` and subtracting 1 after each application.
- The variable `s` will also be the result of applying the permutation `p` to itself `t` times, starting from the initial value of `s` and subtracting 1 after each application.
- The variable `bm` will hold the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration of the inner loop.
- The variable `sm` will hold the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration of the inner loop.
- The variable `sp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after all iterations of the inner loop.
- The variable `bp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after all iterations of the inner loop.
- The final output will depend on the comparison between `bm` and `sm`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the output will be 'Bodya'. If `sm` is greater than `bm`, the output will be 'Sasha'. If they are equal, the output will be 'Draw'.

All other variables and their states will reflect the cumulative effects of the operations performed within the loop, particularly focusing on the permutations applied to `b` and `s`, and the calculations involving `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`.
