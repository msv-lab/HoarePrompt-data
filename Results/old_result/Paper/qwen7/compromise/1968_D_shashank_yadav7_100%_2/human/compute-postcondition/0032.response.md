Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp + a[b]`, `sp` is `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Since `k` is 0, `a[b] * k + bp` simplifies to just `bp`, so `bm` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `bp + a[b]`. The value of `sp` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
