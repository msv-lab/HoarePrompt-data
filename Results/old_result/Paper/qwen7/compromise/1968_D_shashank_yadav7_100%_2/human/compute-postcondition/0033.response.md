Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `k` is 0 (not part of the loop head)
   - `b` is `p[b] - 1` (not part of the loop head)
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1` (not part of the loop head)
   - `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp + a[b]` (not part of the loop head)
   - `sp` is `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]` (not part of the loop head)

4. **Adjust the states of the loop head variables**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now 2
   - `n` must still be greater than 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
