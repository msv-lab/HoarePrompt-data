Output State: **`k` is an integer, `b` is `p[b]` - 1, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
