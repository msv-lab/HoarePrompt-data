Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `p`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
