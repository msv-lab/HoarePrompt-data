Output State: **`bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `i` is 2, `k` is 0, `sm` is `p[s] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s]`**.

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Given the initial state, `s` is equal to `p[s] - 1`, so `sp` is updated to `a[p[s] - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
