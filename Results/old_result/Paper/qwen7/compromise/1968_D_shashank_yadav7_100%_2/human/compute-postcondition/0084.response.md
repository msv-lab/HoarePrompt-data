Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, and `b` is `p[b] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` adds the value of `a[s]` to `sp`. Since `sp` was previously `sp + a[s]`, adding `a[s]` again means `sp` is now `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `sp + 2 * a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
