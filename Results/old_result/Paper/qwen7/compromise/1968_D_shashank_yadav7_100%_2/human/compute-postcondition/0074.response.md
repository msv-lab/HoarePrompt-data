Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]**.

Explanation: The variable `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
