Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `k` is `n` - 1**

Explanation: The initial state is that `n` must be greater than 0. The code `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. Since `k` was originally equal to `n`, after decrementing, `k` becomes `n - 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 still holds true, so we express `n` as being greater than 1 (since it was originally greater than 0 and we just subtracted 1 from `k`, which means `n` must now be at least 1).
