Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `k` is 0, `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `s` is the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration, `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration, `b` is the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration, and `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. If `bm < sm`, then the condition remains true. If `bm >= sm`, then the condition remains unchanged.**
