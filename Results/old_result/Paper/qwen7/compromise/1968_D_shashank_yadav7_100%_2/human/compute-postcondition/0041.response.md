Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial state, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, and `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`. The value of `sm` is updated based on the new value of `k` and the value of `sp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
