Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the necessary inputs including the permutation `p`, the array `a`, and the starting positions `b` and `s`.

2. **Position and Score Calculation**: The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by simulating the game for `k` turns. It updates the positions and scores based on the rules provided.

3. **Max Score Calculation**: For each turn, the program updates the maximum possible scores (`bm` for Bodya and `sm` for Sasha) by considering the current position and the potential move to the new position indicated by the permutation `p`.

4. **Output Determination**: After calculating the final scores, the program compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

The logic implemented in the program matches the problem requirements accurately, and the code handles all the specified constraints and edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
