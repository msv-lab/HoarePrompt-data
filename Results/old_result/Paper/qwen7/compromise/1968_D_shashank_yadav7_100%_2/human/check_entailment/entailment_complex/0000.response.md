Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to zero-based indices (`b` and `s`).
3. It initializes `sp` and `bp` with the initial scores at positions `s` and `b`, respectively.
4. The main loop iterates up to `k` times, updating the positions of `b` and `s` according to the permutation `p` and recalculating the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm`.
5. After the loop, it compares `bm` and `sm` and prints the appropriate outcome ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements and correctly determines the winner of the game for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
