Based on the initial state provided, the variables `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and the sum of `a` and `b` is odd. 

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('alice')
```

Since the print statement is printing a string literal 'alice', and there are no variables or expressions evaluated within the print statement, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **alice**
