### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets. They can also choose to swap wallets at any point during their turn. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The key insight here is that the game is essentially about parity (even or odd). If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because:
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves (if Alice removes a coin, Bob can remove a coin from his own wallet, and vice versa), ensuring he will be the last to make a move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by mirroring his moves until she is the one to make the last move.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input string `s` and converts the first and second elements to integers `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if `(a + b)` is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The code handles multiple test cases as expected.
   - The implementation matches the optimal strategy described above.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
