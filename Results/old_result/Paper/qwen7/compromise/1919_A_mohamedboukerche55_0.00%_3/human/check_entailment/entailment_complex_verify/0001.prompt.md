You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, with their final values determined by the last input received during the loop's execution.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. If the sum of a and b is even, the sum remains even. If the sum of a and b is odd, the sum remains odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads pairs of non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) from standard input until the end of input is reached. It then checks if the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob'. If the sum is odd, it prints 'alice'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output stream by printing 'bob' or 'alice' based on the condition.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. Both players take turns, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains two space-separated integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It splits the string into two parts and converts them to integers.
   - It checks if the sum of these integers is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of checking the parity of the sum is correct.
   - The program correctly handles the input and outputs the expected results based on the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
