You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, where each line is determined by the values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) for each test case. Specifically:
    #
    #- If \(B \times 2 < C\), the output will be \(A \times B\).
    #- If \(A\) is even, the output will be \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
    #- If \(A\) is odd, the output will first print \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) (integer division), followed by \(X \times C + B\).
    #
    #Each test case's output is independent of others, and the total output will be the concatenation of outputs from all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\):
- If \(2b < c\), it prints \(a \times b\).
- If \(a\) is even, it prints \(\frac{a \times c}{2}\).
- If \(a\) is odd, it first prints \(\frac{a}{2}\) (integer division), followed by \(\frac{a}{2} \times c + b\).

After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of lines, each corresponding to the output of a single test case, without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the case where `n` is odd and `B * 2 >= C`. In such a scenario, the program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) followed by `X * C + B`, which is not the minimum cost.

For example, in the test case `3 5 11`, the correct output should be `15` because Maxim can buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and 1 yogurt at the regular price (5 burles), totaling 16 burles. However, the program prints `15` followed by `11`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should calculate the minimum cost directly without printing intermediate values. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b * 2 <= a:
            print(n * b)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)

func()
```

This version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for all cases.
