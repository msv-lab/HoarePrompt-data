Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the case where `n` is odd and `B * 2 >= C`. In such a scenario, the program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) followed by `X * C + B`, which is not the minimum cost.

For example, in the test case `3 5 11`, the correct output should be `15` because Maxim can buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and 1 yogurt at the regular price (5 burles), totaling 16 burles. However, the program prints `15` followed by `11`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should calculate the minimum cost directly without printing intermediate values. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b * 2 <= a:
            print(n * b)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)

func()
```

This version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for all cases.
