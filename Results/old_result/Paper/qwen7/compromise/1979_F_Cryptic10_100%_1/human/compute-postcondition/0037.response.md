Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple unpacking `(v1, v2) in ops[::-1]`. This means the loop is iterating over the reversed `ops` list, and each iteration assigns the values from the tuple to `v1` and `v2`.

2. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `ops` must have at least 2 elements.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the reversed `ops` list.

4. **Adjusting the State for Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the reversed `ops` list, the next element in the list will be processed in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still have at least 2 elements, but since it is being iterated in reverse, the list will now have one less element compared to the previous state.

5. **New State**:
   - `ops` must have at least 1 element (since it had at least 2 elements before and one element was processed).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ops` must have at least 1 element**.
