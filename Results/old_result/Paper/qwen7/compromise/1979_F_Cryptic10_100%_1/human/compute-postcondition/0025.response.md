Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `v1` is no longer in `vx`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing the tuples (`v1`, `v2`).**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Since `v2` is the new second last element of `vx` after `v1` is removed, the updated list `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. The precondition that `vx` has at least 2 elements and `v1` is removed from `vx` remains valid.
