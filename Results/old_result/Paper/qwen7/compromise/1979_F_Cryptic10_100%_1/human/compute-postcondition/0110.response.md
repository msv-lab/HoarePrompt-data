Output State: **`vx` has at least 1 element, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is now the element at index len(`vx`) - 1, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(v1, v2)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The value of `v1` is removed from `vx`, and `v2` is now the last element of `vx`. The length of `vx` decreases by 1, and `ops` contains the new tuple.
