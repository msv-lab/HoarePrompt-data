Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`. `ops` is a list containing tuples derived from the operations performed during each iteration.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the set `vx` will contain only the last two elements from the original set of integers from 1 to `n`. The list `ops` will contain all the tuples generated during each iteration of the loop, following the rules specified in the loop body. Specifically, if `v2` (the second last element removed in each iteration) is greater than 0, it will add tuples like `(v1, v2)` and `(v2, v2)` to `ops`. If `v2` is not greater than 0, it will add tuples like `(0, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to `ops`.
