Output State: **`ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list; `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.**

Explanation: The code snippet modifies the last tuple in the `ops` list by appending `v1` to its first element. The values of `v1` and `v2` are updated to be the first and second elements of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, respectively. All other variables and the rest of the `ops` list remain unchanged.
