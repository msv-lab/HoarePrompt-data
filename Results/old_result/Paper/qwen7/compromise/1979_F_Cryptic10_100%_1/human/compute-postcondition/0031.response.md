Output State: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers originally in the set before the loop started. `ops` is a list containing a series of tuples that were added during each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. Specifically, if `v2` was greater than 0 during any iteration, the corresponding tuple `(v1, v2)` or `(v2, v2)` was added to `ops`; otherwise, tuples like `(0, 0)` or `(v1, 0)` were added.

This means that after all iterations, `vx` will contain only the two smallest numbers from the original set (since larger numbers are progressively removed), and `ops` will contain a sequence of operations reflecting the removal process as described.
