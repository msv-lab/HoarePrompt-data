Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`.
   - `p1` is a list containing the first element of `vx` and an empty list.
   - `p2` is a list containing all the elements from `ops` that were appended based on the condition (`p2` if `p1[-1] == v2 else `p1`).append(`v1`).

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The exact operations inside the loop are omitted, but we know that the loop modifies `p2` based on some condition involving `p1` and `v1` (and possibly `v2`).

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - The only variables that can be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are those mentioned in the loop head: `_` (which is just a placeholder for the loop index) and the variables that are being updated inside the loop.

Given that the loop runs for a number of times specified by user input, the key variables that need to be adjusted are:
- The number of iterations left, which is represented by the loop index `_`.
- The state of `p2` after the previous iteration, which accumulates the elements based on the condition.

Since the loop index `_` is a placeholder and does not change the actual state of the variables `vx`, `p1`, and `p2`, the only thing that changes is the state of `p2`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `p2` will contain all the elements that were appended in the previous iterations plus the new elements that will be appended based on the current iteration's condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`; `p1` is a list containing the first element of `vx` and an empty list; `p2` is a list containing all the elements from `ops` that were appended based on the condition in the previous iteration.**
