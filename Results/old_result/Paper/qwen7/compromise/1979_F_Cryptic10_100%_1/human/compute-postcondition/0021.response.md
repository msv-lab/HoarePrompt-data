Postcondition: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2 excluding `v1`, `v1` is now `v2`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing two tuples. If `v2` is greater than 0, then the tuples are (`v2`, `v2`) and (`v1`, `v2`). Otherwise, the tuples are (0, 0) and (v1, 0).**
