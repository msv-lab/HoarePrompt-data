Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is an empty set, `p2` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` where `v2 > 0` or two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` where `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, `p1` and `p2` are both empty sets, `v1` is the third last element of `vx`, and `v2` is the second last element of `vx`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` or three tuples `(v1, v2)`, `(v3, 0)`, and `(v1, 0)`, `p1` and `p2` are both empty sets, `v1` is the fourth last element of `vx`, and `v2` is the third last element of `vx`. If `v2 > 0`, `v3` is not included in `vx`; otherwise, `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and is removed from `vx`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `vx` has at least one element, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is now the element at index len(`vx`) - 1, `ops` is a list. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains one tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` has one less element than before, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is now the element at index len(`vx`) - 1, `v3` is the first element returned by function `q(0)`, and `vx` has removed `v3`, `ops` contains two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
