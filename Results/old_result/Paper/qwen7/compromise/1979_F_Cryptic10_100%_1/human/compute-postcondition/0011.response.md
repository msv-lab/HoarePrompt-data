Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2, `v1` is n-3, `v2` is n-3, `v3` is 0, `ops` is a list containing two tuples [(0, 0), (n-3, 0)]**.

Explanation: The code adds two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. Given that `v3` is 0 and `v1` is `n-3`, these tuples are added to `ops`. The sets and other variables remain unchanged.
