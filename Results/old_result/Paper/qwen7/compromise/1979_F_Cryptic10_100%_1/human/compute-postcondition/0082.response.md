Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list with at least two elements, `p2` is the first tuple in `ops` if the last element of the first tuple equals `v2`, otherwise the first tuple in `ops` appends `v1` to itself and `p1` remains unchanged, `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in the list `ops`.**

Explanation: The code checks if the last element of the first tuple in `ops` (`p1`) is equal to `v2`. If it is, then `p1` is assigned to `p2`. Otherwise, `p1` appends `v1` to itself, and `p2` is set to `p1`. The values of `vx` and `ops` remain unchanged from their initial state.
