Output State: `vx` will be an empty list, `ops` remains unchanged, `p1` contains the elements of the original `vx`, and `p2` remains an empty list.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the tuples in `ops` in reverse order, appending elements to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition. Since `vx` initially has exactly 2 elements, and the loop processes each tuple in `ops` by removing one element from `vx` per iteration, after processing all tuples in `ops`, `vx` will be completely emptied. The value of `ops` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `p1` and `p2`. After all iterations, `p1` will contain the elements originally in `vx` (in the order they were removed), and `p2` remains empty as it was initialized.
