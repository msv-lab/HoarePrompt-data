Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` where `v2 > 0` or two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` where `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, `p1` and `p2` are both empty sets, `v1` is now the fourth last element of `vx`, and `v2` is now the third last element of `vx`.**

Explanation: The code `vx.remove(v1)` removes the element `v1` from the list `vx`. Since `v1` was the third last element of `vx`, its removal means that `v1` is no longer the third last element but the fourth last element. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
