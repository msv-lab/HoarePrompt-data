Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list that must have at least one element, `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in `ops`, and (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) is appended with v1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)` checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If it is, then `p2` is used; otherwise, `p1` is used. The result of this conditional expression is then appended with `v1`. Since `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in `ops`, and `p1` and `p2` are parts of this tuple, the specific elements of `p1` and `p2` are not known, but the structure remains as described. The `vx` set remains unchanged, and `ops` is modified according to the condition.
