Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code creates a set `vx` containing integers from 1 to the positive integer input plus 1 (excluding the upper bound), and initializes an empty list `ops`. The input must be a positive integer, which is used to determine the range of the set `vx`. The variable `ops` remains an empty list as no operations have been performed on it yet.
