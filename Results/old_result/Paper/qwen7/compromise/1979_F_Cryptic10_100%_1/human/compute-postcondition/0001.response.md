Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python when you don't care about the value) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and its value is not significant for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `_`.
   - The expression `int(input())` is what determines how many times the loop will run. It reads an integer from the input, and this integer should be a positive integer because the loop runs for that many iterations.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). However, these values are not directly relevant to the loop condition since `t` is used for defining the number of test cases, and `n` is not used in the loop itself.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, the input read by `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Since the loop runs for the number of test cases defined by `t`, `t` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be a positive integer**
