Based on the initial state provided:

- `vx` is an empty set.
- `ops` is an empty list.
- `p1` is an empty set and an empty list.
- `p2` is the last tuple in `ops` if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` equals the second last element of `ops`, otherwise `p1` appends all `v1` values from `ops` to itself.

Given that `ops` is an empty list, there are no tuples in `ops`. Therefore, `p2` will be `p1` since the condition `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)` cannot be evaluated as there are no elements in `ops`.

Since `ops` is empty, `p1` remains an empty set and list, and `p2` also remains an empty set and list.

The print statement is:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

Since both `p1` and `p2` are empty, `p1[::-1] + p2` results in an empty list. Thus, `' '.join(map(str, []))` will result in an empty string.

Output: **! []**
