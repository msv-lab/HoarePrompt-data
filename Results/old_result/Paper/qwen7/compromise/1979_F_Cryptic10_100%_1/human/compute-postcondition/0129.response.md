Output State: **`vx` is an empty list, `ops` is a list of tuples, `p1` is an empty list, and `p2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `vx` will be an empty list since it starts with exactly 2 elements and one element is removed in each iteration until it is empty. The `ops` list will retain all the tuples that were appended during the loop's execution. Both `p1` and `p2` will be empty lists because `p1` starts as an empty list and only appends elements when the condition `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)` is met, but by the end of the loop, no elements are added to `p1`. Similarly, `p2` starts as an empty list and only accumulates elements from `ops` in reverse order, but since `vx` is empty by the end, no elements are added to `p2`.
