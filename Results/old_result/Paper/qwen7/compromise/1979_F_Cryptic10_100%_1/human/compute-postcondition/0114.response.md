Postcondition: `vx` has at least one element, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is now the element at index len(`vx`) - 1, `ops` is a list. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains one tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` has one fewer element than before, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is now the element at index len(`vx`) - 1, `v3` is the first element returned by function `q(0)`, and `vx` has removed `v3`, `ops` contains two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
