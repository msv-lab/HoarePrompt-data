Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`; `p1` is a list containing the first element of `vx` and an empty list; `p2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code assigns the elements of the set `vx` to the list `p1` and initializes an empty list `p2`. The set `vx` remains unchanged, and its elements are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`. Therefore, `p1` contains these two elements as a list, and `p2` is an empty list.
