Output State: **`vx` has at least one element less than before, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is now the element at index len(`vx`) - 1, `v3` is the first element returned by function `q(0)`, and `vx` has removed `v3`, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code adds two tuples to the `ops` list. The first tuple contains `v3` and `0`, and the second tuple contains `v1` and `0`. Since `v3` was removed from `vx` during the function call `q(0)`, and `v1` was already removed from `vx` before, the length of `vx` is reduced by one. `v2` remains the last element of `vx` after these operations.
