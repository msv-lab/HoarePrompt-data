The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each tuple, it calculates the count value based on the remainders of the numbers in the list when divided by `x` and `y`. It then appends these count values to a list `results`. After processing all tuples, the function returns the `results` list, which contains the count values for each test case. Additionally, the function maintains two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the overall frequencies of remainders when all numbers in the lists from all test cases are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
