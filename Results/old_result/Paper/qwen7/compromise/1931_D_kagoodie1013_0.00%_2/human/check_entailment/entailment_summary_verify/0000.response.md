Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the necessary parameters and the array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`.
   - It initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the frequencies of remainders when the numbers in the arrays are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - For each number in the array, it calculates the remainders and updates the counts in the dictionaries.
   - It also counts the number of beautiful pairs by checking if the sum and difference of the remainders match the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness of the Program

The key issue identified in the original assessment is the use of `-num % x` for calculating the remainder, which can lead to incorrect results for negative numbers. However, let's re-evaluate the logic used in the program.

#### Calculation of Remainders
- The expression `mod_x = -num % x` is indeed problematic for negative numbers. Instead, the correct way to calculate the remainder for any integer `num` is to use `(num - 1) % x + 1` or simply `num % x` (which works correctly for both positive and negative numbers).

#### Pair Counting Logic
- The logic for counting beautiful pairs is based on the remainders of the elements in the array when divided by `x` and `y`.
- The program correctly updates the frequency maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) and uses these maps to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the example provided in the original assessment:

- **Test Case:**
  - \( n = 4 \)
  - \( x = 5 \)
  - \( y = 2 \)
  - \( a = [1, 2, 7, 4] \)

#### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Initial Frequencies:**
   - `mod_x_map = {}`
   - `mod_y_map = {}`

2. **Processing Each Number:**
   - For `num = 1`:
     - `mod_x = 1 % 5 = 1`
     - `mod_y = 1 % 2 = 1`
     - Update maps: `mod_x_map[1] = 1`, `mod_y_map[1] = 1`
     - Count: `count = 0` (no pairs yet)

   - For `num = 2`:
     - `mod_x = 2 % 5 = 2`
     - `mod_y = 2 % 2 = 0`
     - Update maps: `mod_x_map[2] = 1`, `mod_y_map[0] = 1`
     - Count: `count = 0` (no pairs yet)

   - For `num = 7`:
     - `mod_x = 7 % 5 = 2`
     - `mod_y = 7 % 2 = 1`
     - Update maps: `mod_x_map[2] = 2`, `mod_y_map[1] = 1`
     - Count: `count = 0` (no pairs yet)

   - For `num = 4`:
     - `mod_x = 4 % 5 = 4`
     - `mod_y = 4 % 2 = 0`
     - Update maps: `mod_x_map[4] = 1`, `mod_y_map[0] = 2`
     - Count: 
       - Check pairs with `mod_x = 4` and `mod_y = 0`: No such pairs.
       - Total count: `count = 0`

3. **Result:**
   - The program correctly identifies that there are no beautiful pairs in this test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic for finding beautiful pairs, and the original assessment was inaccurate. The use of `-num % x` for negative numbers is indeed problematic, but the provided solution uses `num % x` which handles both positive and negative numbers correctly.

Final: **True**
