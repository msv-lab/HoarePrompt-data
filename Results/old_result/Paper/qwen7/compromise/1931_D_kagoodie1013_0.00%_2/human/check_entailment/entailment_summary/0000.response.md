Reasoning:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and then splits the input into manageable parts. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, the program extracts the necessary parameters (n, x, y, and the array) and processes them individually.

3. **Count Calculation**: The program uses two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the frequency of remainders when the elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. This helps in efficiently counting the number of beautiful pairs without having to compare every pair directly.

4. **Modulo Operations**: The program uses modulo operations to ensure that the conditions for a beautiful pair are met. Specifically, it checks if the sum of two elements is divisible by `x` and their difference is divisible by `y`.

5. **Result Collection**: The count of beautiful pairs for each test case is stored in the `results` list, which is returned at the end.

Given the detailed explanation and the structure of the code, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
