Output State: **`count` is 2, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is {'`num % x`': 1}, `mod_y_map` is {'`num % y`': 1}, `results` is [0], `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code assigns `num % y` to `mod_y_key`. Since `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, and the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged, the only change is that `mod_y_key` now holds the value of `num % y`. All other variables retain their initial states.
