Output State: **`count` is 3 + `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` + `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `-num % x`, `mod_x_map` is updated based on the new value of `-num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map` is updated based on the new value of `num % y`, `results` is [0]**.

This means that the `count` variable is updated by adding the values obtained from `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)` to its current value of 3. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, with `num` being the third element of `arr`, `mod_y` being `num % y`, `mod_x_key` being `-num % x`, `mod_y_key` being `num % y`, and `results` remaining as `[0]`. The maps `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are also updated based on the new values of `-num % x` and `num % y`, respectively.
