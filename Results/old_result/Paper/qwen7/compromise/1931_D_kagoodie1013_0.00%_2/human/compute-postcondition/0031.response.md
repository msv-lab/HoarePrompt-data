Output State: `arr` is an empty list, `num` is not defined (since the loop has completed and there are no more elements in `arr`), `mod_y_key` is not defined, `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` values accumulated over all iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % x` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appeared, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appeared.

This final state reflects that the loop has processed all elements in `arr`, updating the counts of remainders for both `x` and `y` divisions, and accumulating the total count in `count`.
