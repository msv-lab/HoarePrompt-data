Output State: **`count` is 2, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is {'`num % x`': 1}, `mod_y_map` is {'`num % y`': 1}, `results` is [0], `mod_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The line `mod_x_key = num % x` updates the value of `mod_x_key` to be the result of `num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
