Output State: **`results` is a list containing one more element than before, which is the current value of `count`; `count` is the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`; `mod_x_map` contains the frequency of each `mod_x_key` (i.e., `num % x`), `mod_y_map` contains the frequency of each `mod_y_key` (i.e., `num % y`).**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. Since `count` is the sum of the frequencies of the remainders when each number in `arr` is divided by `x` and `y`, appending this value to `results` increases the length of `results` by one, and the new value in `results` is the current value of `count`. The values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within this line of code.
