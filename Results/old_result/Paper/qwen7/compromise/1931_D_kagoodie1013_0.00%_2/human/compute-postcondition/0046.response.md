Output State: **`count` is 0, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `-num % x`, `mod_x_map` is {'-num % x': 1}, `mod_y_map` is {'num % y': 1}, `results` is [0]**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_x` to `-num % x`. Since the initial value of `mod_x_key` was `num % x`, it is now updated to `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
