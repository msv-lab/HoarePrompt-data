Output State: **`count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is `[0]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`**.

This means that the variable `mod_y` is now assigned the value of `num % y`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
