Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, count is 0, (n, x, y, arr) must be a valid tuple from test_cases.**

In this case, the code simply initializes the variable `count` to 0. Since `test_cases` and `results` are unchanged, they retain their initial state. The only new information is that `count` is now 0.
