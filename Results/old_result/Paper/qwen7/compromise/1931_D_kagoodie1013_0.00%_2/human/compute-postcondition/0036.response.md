Output State: **`count` is 0, `num` is not defined, `mod_y_key` is not defined, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `count`.**

Explanation: The code `mod_y_map = {}` initializes `mod_y_map` as an empty dictionary. This overrides the previous state where `mod_y_map` was a dictionary mapping remainders of `num % y` to their counts. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
