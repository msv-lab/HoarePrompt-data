Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is not defined initially.
   - `arr` is not defined initially.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `mod_y_key` is not defined.
   - `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `count`, so `results` is `[0]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `arr`. Once `arr` is exhausted, the loop will stop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` is not defined, it means `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to start.
   - `results` already contains `[0]` which is the initial value of `count`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must contain at least one element.
- `num` will be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `mod_y_key` is not defined, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is `[0]`**
