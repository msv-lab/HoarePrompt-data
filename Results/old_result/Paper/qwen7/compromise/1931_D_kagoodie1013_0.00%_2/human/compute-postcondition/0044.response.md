Output State: **`count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is {'num % x': 1}, `mod_y_map` is {'num % y': 1}, `results` is [0]**.

Explanation: The code updates the `mod_y_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of `mod_y_key` (which is `num % y`). Initially, `mod_y_map` was an empty dictionary `{}`, and now it contains the key `num % y` with a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
