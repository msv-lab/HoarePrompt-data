Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr`. The key variables involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the last element of `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` is the last element of `arr`, removing `num` from `arr` will leave us with the new `arr` (which now has one less element).
   - For the loop to execute again, `arr` must still have at least one element.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `arr` must have at least one element remaining after removing the last element `num`.
- `num` will be the new last element of the updated `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the last element of `arr`**
