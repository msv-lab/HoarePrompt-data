Output State: **`count` is 3 + `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` + `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is updated based on the new value of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map` is updated based on the new value of `num % y`, `results` is [0]**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_x_key` to `num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `count` is dependent on the initial state and does not get updated by this line of code.
