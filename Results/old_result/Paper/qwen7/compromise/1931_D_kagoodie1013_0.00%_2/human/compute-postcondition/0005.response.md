Output State: **`mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `mod_y_map = {}` creates a new empty dictionary named `mod_y_map`. This initializes `mod_y_map` as an empty dictionary, while the other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `count`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
