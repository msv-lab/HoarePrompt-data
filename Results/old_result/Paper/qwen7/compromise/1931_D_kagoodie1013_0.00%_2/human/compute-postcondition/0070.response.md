Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.**

Explanation: The code `mod_y = num % y` calculates the modulus of `num` (which is the last element of `arr`) divided by `y` and assigns the result to `mod_y`. The values of `arr` and `num` remain unchanged, but now `mod_y` holds the remainder of the division operation.
