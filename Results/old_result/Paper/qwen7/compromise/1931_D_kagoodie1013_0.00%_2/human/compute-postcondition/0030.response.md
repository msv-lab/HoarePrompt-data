Output State: `arr` is an empty list, `num` is not defined, `mod_y_key` is not defined, `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` for each element in the original `arr`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is `num % x` for each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is `num % y` for each element in `arr` and the value is the count of occurrences of that remainder.

This means that after the loop has executed for all elements in `arr`, `arr` will be empty, `num` and `mod_y_key` will no longer be defined since the loop has completed, `count` will hold the total sum of occurrences of each remainder when divided by `x` and `y` across all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` will contain the frequency of each possible remainder when dividing by `x`, and `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each possible remainder when dividing by `y`.
