Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), the amount received back if it wins is \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \).
   - We need to find a distribution \( \text{bet}_1, \text{bet}_2, \ldots, \text{bet}_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^n \text{bet}_i < k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) for all \( i \).

2. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \).
   - `func_2(numbers)`: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers. It iteratively applies `func_1` to pairs of numbers in the list.

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - The goal is to find a set of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any outcome.
   - The key insight is that we can use the LCM of the multipliers \( k_i \) to ensure that the total bet is sufficiently small compared to the payouts.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly computes the LCM of the list of multipliers.
   - However, the main logic to determine the bets is missing from the given code. The LCM calculation alone does not provide the necessary bets.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided functions do not directly solve the problem as stated. They only compute the LCM, which is a part of the solution but not the entire solution.
   - To solve the problem, we need to:
     - Compute the LCM of the multipliers.
     - Distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM value.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not fully solve the problem as it lacks the logic to distribute the bets correctly. Therefore, the program is incomplete and cannot be considered correct based on the problem statement.

**Correctness: **False**
