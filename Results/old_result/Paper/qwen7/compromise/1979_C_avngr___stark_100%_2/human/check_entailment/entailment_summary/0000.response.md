Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This requires finding a distribution where the sum of the bets is less than the minimum product of the bet and the corresponding multiplier.

2. **Key Functions Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the absolute value of the product of \(a\) and \(b\) divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). This is used to find a common factor between two numbers.
   - **func_2(numbers)**: This function takes a list of multipliers and uses `func_1` to compute a cumulative result. Essentially, it finds the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers because the LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set.

3. **Main Logic in the Program**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then divides this LCM by each multiplier to get the corresponding bet amount.
   - If the sum of these bet amounts is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

4. **Verification**:
   - The LCM calculation ensures that the bet amounts are distributed in a way that minimizes the total bet while ensuring the condition is met.
   - The division step ensures that the bet amounts are integer values within the specified range.
   - The check at the end ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM, which guarantees coming out ahead in any winning scenario.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
