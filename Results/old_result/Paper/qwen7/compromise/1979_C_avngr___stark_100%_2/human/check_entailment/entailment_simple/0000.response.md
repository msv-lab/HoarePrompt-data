Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This involves finding a distribution that ensures the sum of bets is less than the minimum product of the bet and the corresponding multiplier for any outcome.

2. **Key Functions Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Given the constraints (2 <= a, b <= 20), this function simplifies the product of `a` and `b` to its simplest form.
   - **func_2(numbers)**: This function computes the cumulative result of applying `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the list `numbers`. Essentially, it finds the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list, which is crucial for determining the minimum bet that can satisfy the condition for all outcomes.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2(k)` to get the LCM of the multipliers.
   - It then calculates the bets using the LCM and prints the result if the sum of bets is less than the LCM; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of calculating the LCM using `func_2` is correct because the LCM ensures that the total bet is minimized while still being sufficient to cover the highest required payout.
   - The check `if sum(c) >= m:` correctly identifies whether the total bet exceeds the minimum required payout.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
