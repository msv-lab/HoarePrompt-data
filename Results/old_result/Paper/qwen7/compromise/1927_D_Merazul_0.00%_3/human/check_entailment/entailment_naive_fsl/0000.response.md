Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to set operations rather than finding pairs of different elements within a specified range of an array.

The program reads inputs and performs set operations to check for the existence of elements in different ranges but does not actually find pairs of different elements within the specified ranges. For instance, consider the following input:

```
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output would be:
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
2 3
```

However, the provided program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly handle the range queries and find pairs of different elements within those ranges. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
