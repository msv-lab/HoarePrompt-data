Output State: **`k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `t` is 0, `a` is a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()` except for the second element.**

Explanation: The code `a = {*R()}` creates a set `a` from the elements of the tuple returned by `R()`. Since `k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, it is not included in the set `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still 0.
