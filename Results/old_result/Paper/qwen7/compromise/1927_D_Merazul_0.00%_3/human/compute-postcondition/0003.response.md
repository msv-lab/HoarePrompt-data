Output State: **`t` is a positive integer reduced by 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= n, `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers.**

In this case, the variable `t` is decremented by 1, making it a positive integer reduced by 1 from its initial value. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
