Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `f` is `False`.
   - `i` is equal to `k`.
   - `k` is at least 3.
   - `u` is always `False` because `i` will eventually exceed the elements in `a`.
   - `v` is always `False` because `i` will eventually exceed the elements in `b`.
   - `m` is `0`.
   - `n` is `-k`.
   - `b` is not defined, but since it's not used in the print statement, we can ignore it.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`

3. **Evaluate Each Part:**
   - `f ^ 1`: This is `False ^ 1`, which evaluates to `True` because `False` XOR `1` is `True`.
   - `m | n < 0`: This is `0 | (-k) < 0`, which simplifies to `(-k) < 0`. Since `k` is at least 3, `-k` is definitely less than 0.
   - `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0`: This is `True or True`, which evaluates to `True`.

4. **String Slicing:**
   - `'YNEOS'[True::2]`: The string `'YNEOS'` is sliced with a step of 2 starting from the first character (index 0). The result is `'YN'`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The expression `'YNEOS'[True::2]` evaluates to `'YN'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **'YN'**
