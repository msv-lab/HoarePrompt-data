Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, k + 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1 (since the range function starts from 1).
   - `i` will take values from 1 to `k` inclusive.

3. **Check the Given States:**
   - `t` is True-1 (This variable is not needed for the loop to execute).
   - `f` is 1 (This variable is not needed for the loop to execute).
   - `i` is equal to `k` (This is an initial condition but not relevant for the loop execution).
   - `k` is at least 3 (This ensures the loop can run multiple times).
   - `u` is always False (This variable is not needed for the loop to execute).
   - `v` is always False (This variable is not needed for the loop to execute).
   - `m` is -3 (This variable is not needed for the loop to execute).
   - `n` is -3 (This variable is not needed for the loop to execute).
   - `b` is a set containing the elements returned by `R()` (This variable is not needed for the loop to execute).
   - `_` is the second element of `R()`'s return (This variable is not needed for the loop to execute).
   - `k` is the first element of `R()`'s return (This variable is not needed for the loop to execute).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, and given that `k` is at least 3, we can use `k` being at least 3 as the condition.
   - `i` will start from 1 and go up to `k`, so initially, `i` should be 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be at least 3.
- `i` must be 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 3**
