Output State: **`k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `t` is 0, `a` is a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()` except for the second element, `b` is a set containing all elements of the tuple returned by `R()`**.

Explanation: The code `b = {*R()}` creates a set `b` containing all elements of the tuple returned by `R()`. Since `k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, and `a` is a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()` except for the second element, the value of `k` remains unchanged, `t` remains 0, and `a` remains a set containing the elements of the tuple except for the second element. The new set `b` contains all elements of the tuple returned by `R()`.
