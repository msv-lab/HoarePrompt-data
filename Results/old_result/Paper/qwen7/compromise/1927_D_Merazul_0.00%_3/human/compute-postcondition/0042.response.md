Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 3, `u` is False, `v` is False, `f` is False, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n - (~False & False)` which simplifies to `n - 0` or simply `n**.

In natural language: `i` remains 1, `k` must still be at least 3, `u` and `v` remain False, `f` remains False, `m` remains unchanged, and `n` is reduced by 0, so `n` remains unchanged.
