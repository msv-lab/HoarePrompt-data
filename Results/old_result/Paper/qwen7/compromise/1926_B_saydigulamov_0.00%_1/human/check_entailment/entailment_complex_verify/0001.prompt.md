You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, with the size of the triangle or square being greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 2 ≤ a ≤ 10, `i` is 10, `k` is a list containing the total count of '1' in all input strings `b` where '1' was found for all iterations of the loop, and `b` is the final input string from the user. The first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it checks if the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square made up of '1's, where the size of the shape is greater than 1. If the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, it prints these counts. The function does not return any value but prints the counts if the condition is met.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine whether the `1`s in the grid form a square or a triangle.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes no arguments but reads from standard input.
   - It first reads an integer `a`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.
   - It then checks the count of `1`s in each row and appends these counts to the list `k`.
   - Finally, it prints the first element of `k`.

3. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The logic in the function does not correctly identify whether the `1`s form a square or a triangle.
   - The function only checks if the first two rows have the same number of `1`s, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.
   - The function does not check the pattern of `1`s across multiple rows to determine if they form a square or a triangle.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly identify the shape, we need to check the pattern of `1`s in the grid.
   - For a square, the number of `1`s in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the number of `1`s in each row should increase by 2 until reaching the middle row, then decrease symmetrically.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function does not implement the correct logic to determine the shape.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
