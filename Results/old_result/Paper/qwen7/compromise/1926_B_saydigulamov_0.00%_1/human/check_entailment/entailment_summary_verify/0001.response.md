### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine whether the `1`s in the grid form a square or a triangle.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes no arguments but reads from standard input.
   - It first reads an integer `a`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.
   - It then checks the count of `1`s in each row and appends these counts to the list `k`.
   - Finally, it prints the first element of `k`.

3. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The logic in the function does not correctly identify whether the `1`s form a square or a triangle.
   - The function only checks if the first two rows have the same number of `1`s, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.
   - The function does not check the pattern of `1`s across multiple rows to determine if they form a square or a triangle.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly identify the shape, we need to check the pattern of `1`s in the grid.
   - For a square, the number of `1`s in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the number of `1`s in each row should increase by 2 until reaching the middle row, then decrease symmetrically.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The provided function summary states that the function checks if the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are equal and prints these counts if they are. This is incorrect because it does not actually determine the shape of the grid.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function does not implement the correct logic to determine the shape.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
