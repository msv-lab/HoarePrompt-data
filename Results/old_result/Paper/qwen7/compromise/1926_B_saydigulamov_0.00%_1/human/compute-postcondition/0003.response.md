Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know the following from the initial state:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is an empty list.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Since `t` is already constrained to be between 1 and 100, it can be used directly as the input value. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value (which will be assigned to `int(input())`) is within the valid range.

4. **Formulate the Final State**: Given that `t` is already in the valid range, we can set `int(input())` to `t` to ensure the loop executes. The other variables (`a`, `i`, and `k`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute and can remain as they are.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, int(input()) is `t`**
