Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b`, `b` is a string from the user containing the character '1'**.

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends to the list `k` the count of the character '1' in the string `b`. Since `b` is given to be a string from the user containing the character '1', `b.count('1')` will be at least 1. Therefore, `k` will contain this count. All other variables remain unchanged.
