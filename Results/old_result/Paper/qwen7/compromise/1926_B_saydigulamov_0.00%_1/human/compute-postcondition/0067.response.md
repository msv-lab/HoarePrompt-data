Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is at least 1, `i` is 7, `k` is a list containing one additional element which is the count of '1' in the string `b`, `b` is the new input string from the user. If the string `b` contains the character '1', `k` will have an additional count of '1'. If the string `b` does not contain the character '1', `k` remains unchanged.
