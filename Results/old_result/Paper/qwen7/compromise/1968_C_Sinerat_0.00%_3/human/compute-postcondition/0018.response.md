Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 500**.

Explanation: The code `a[0] = 500` assigns the value 500 to the first element of the list `a`. All other elements of `a` remain as zeros since the list was initially filled with zeros. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
