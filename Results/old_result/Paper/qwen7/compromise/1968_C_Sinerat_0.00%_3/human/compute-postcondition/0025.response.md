Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is `a[2] + x[2]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[3]` by adding `x[2]` to `a[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` is still an input integer greater than 3, `a[1]` is still `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is still `a[1] + x[1]`, and `a[3]` is now `a[2] + x[2]`.
