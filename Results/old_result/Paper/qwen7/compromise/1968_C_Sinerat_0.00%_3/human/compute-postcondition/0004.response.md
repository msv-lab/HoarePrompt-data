Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 500**.

Explanation: The code sets the first element of list `a` to 500. All other elements of `a` remain as zeros, and the values of `n` and `x` are unchanged from their initial states.
