Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] + 1`; `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be equal to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is defined as `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] + 1`, which remains unchanged by the assignment to `a[i]`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is also preserved.
