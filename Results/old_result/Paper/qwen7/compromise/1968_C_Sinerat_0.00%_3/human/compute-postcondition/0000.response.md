Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder used in Python to indicate that the variable is not being used. It is typically used for iterating over a range without needing the index or value.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. The input should be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop will execute for each input provided, the state needs to reflect that the input will be a valid integer within the given range. The variables `t`, `n`, and `x` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input itself, which must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
