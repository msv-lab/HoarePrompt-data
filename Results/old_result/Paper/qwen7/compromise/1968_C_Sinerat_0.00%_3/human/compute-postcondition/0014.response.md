Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The first element `a[0]` is initialized to 500.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `n` and the input that determines how many times the loop will run. The loop runs `int(input())` times.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 1. This means that the loop has already executed at least once, and now it needs to determine if it should execute again based on the value of `n`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will terminate.

Given this information, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`. The value of `n` must be such that the loop can execute one more time, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
