Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program attempts to find the smallest number of consecutive identical elements in the list `ar` but this approach does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the problem asks for the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array is no longer beautiful, not just the length of the longest sequence of identical elements.

The program should identify positions where the condition for the array to be beautiful (i.e., `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`) holds true and count the necessary removals to break these conditions. Instead, the current implementation only counts the length of sequences of identical elements without considering the operations needed to make the array non-beautiful.

Therefore, the given program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
