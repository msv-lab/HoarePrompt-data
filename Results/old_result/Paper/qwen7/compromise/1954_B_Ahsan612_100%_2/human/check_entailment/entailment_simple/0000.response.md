Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and counting the maximum number of consecutive identical elements. However, the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. The function does not correctly identify the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition of the array.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the function is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The function calculates the minimum number of consecutive identical elements (`same`) but does not use this information to determine the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The variable `minn` is set to infinity initially and is updated only when a new sequence of identical elements is encountered. This does not account for the fact that removing some elements might break the beauty condition without necessarily reducing the length of the longest sequence of identical elements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**:
   - The function prints `-1` only if `minn` is infinity or equals the length of the array. This is not sufficient to determine whether the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements.
   - For example, in the second test case, the function correctly identifies that one removal is needed, but it does not handle this correctly because it relies solely on the length of the longest sequence of identical elements.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the second test case, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` should result in a minimum of 1 removal (removing the middle '2'). However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `-1` because it does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing fewer elements.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
