Output State: **`i` is 4, `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is equal to `ar[3]`, and `ar[3]` is equal to `num`, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and `same`. Since `same` is either 1 or 2, `minn` will take the smaller value between its original value and 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
