Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers using `input().split()`, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list `ar` from these integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was an input integer before the code execution. The value of `minn` is yet to be determined as the code to calculate it hasn't been provided, but it will be based on the consecutive occurrences of elements in the list `ar`.
