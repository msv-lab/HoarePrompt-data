Output State: **`same` is 3 or 1, `t` is as before, `n` is as before, `ar` is as before, `num` is as before, `minn` is 2 or unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**.

This means that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables (`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
