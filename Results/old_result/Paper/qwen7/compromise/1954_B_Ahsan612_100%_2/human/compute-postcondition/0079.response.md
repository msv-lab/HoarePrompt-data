Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `num` is equal to `ar[i]`; `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `minn` retain their initial values.**

The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. The value of `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is now one more than its previous value. The values of `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `minn` remain unchanged.
