The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 3 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` remains 1. Since the code only increments `i` by 1, regardless of the initial value of `i`, it will now be `i` is 4 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, and `i` is 2 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` must have more than 3 elements, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 4 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 2.**
