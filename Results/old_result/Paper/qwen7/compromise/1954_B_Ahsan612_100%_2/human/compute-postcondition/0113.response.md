The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is either 2 or 3.
- `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1.
- `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `same` is either 1 or 2.
- `num` is equal to `ar[i-1]`.
- `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be incremented and still satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`.

Since `i` is either 2 or 3, incrementing `i` by 1 would make it 3 or 4. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be 3 (since if `i` were 2, incrementing it to 3 would still satisfy the condition, but if it were already 3, incrementing it to 4 would not necessarily satisfy the condition unless `len(ar)` is greater than 4).

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 3. The other states do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`i` is 3, `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is equal to `ar[i-1]`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`**
