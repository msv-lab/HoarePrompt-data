Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1, `same` is equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num` is not specified.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` by setting it to the minimum value between its current value and `same`, which is set to 1 at the end of the loop. Therefore, `minn` will be the minimum value between its original value and 1. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
