To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < len(ar)`. This condition checks if the index `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `same` is 2,
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\),
- `n` is the integer inputted by the user,
- `ar` must have more than one element,
- `num` is the first element of the list `ar`,
- `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1,
- `i` is 3 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` remains 1.

We need to ensure that `i < len(ar)` for the loop to continue executing. Let's analyze the possible values of `i`:

1. If `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 3.
2. If `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, then `i` remains 1.

For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` can either be 1 or 3, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 3 (because if `len(ar)` is 3 or less, `i` cannot be less than `len(ar)`).

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ar` to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 3.

State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` must have more than 3 elements, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 3 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` remains 1.**
