Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `i = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. The value of `i` was originally equal to the length of the list `ar`, but since the code does not depend on the value of `ar` or any other variables, the only change is that `i` is now explicitly set to 1. All other variables retain their initial or calculated states.
