Output State: **`i` is equal to its original value plus 1; `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1; `num` is the integer at index `i` in the list `ar`; `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. The other variables (`i`, `ar`, and `num`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, they retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
