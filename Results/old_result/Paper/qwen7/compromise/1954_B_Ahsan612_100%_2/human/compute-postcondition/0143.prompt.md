You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`. If `minn` was infinity or equal to the length of `ar` at any point, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `minn` is the smallest value found during the loop execution. If no valid minimum consecutive occurrence was found, `minn` will be infinity, indicating that there were no repeating elements in the list `ar` that met the criteria. The final value of `minn` is either the smallest count of consecutive occurrences or infinity, depending on the input list `ar`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `minn` will hold the smallest number of consecutive identical elements found in the list `ar`, or it will be infinity if no such sequence exists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function then returns different outputs based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
