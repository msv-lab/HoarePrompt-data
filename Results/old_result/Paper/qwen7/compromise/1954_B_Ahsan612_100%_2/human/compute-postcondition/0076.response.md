Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` retain their initial values from the precondition.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `ar`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be such that it is still less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` was increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` was increased by 1, it means `i` was previously less than `len(ar)`, but now it must be ensured that `i + 1 < len(ar)`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is still within the bounds required for the loop to continue.

**State:**
- `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` retain their initial values from the precondition.
- `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` retain their initial values from the precondition; `i` must be less than `len(ar)`**
