Output State: **`same` is increased by 1, and `i` must be less than the length of `ar`, and `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. The conditions and values of the other variables and the list `ar` remain unchanged from the initial state.
