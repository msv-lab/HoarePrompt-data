Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive)
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1
   - `num` is the first element of the list `ar` or any subsequent element that matches `same`
   - `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`
   - `minn` is the smallest value between its original value and the current value of `same`, and `minn` is either `inf`, the length of `ar`, or a specific integer value found in `ar`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop will run.

Given that the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is the value of `int(input())`.

Since the loop is set to run based on user input, the new value of `int(input())` will determine if the loop continues. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `int(input())` is greater than 0.

**State: **`same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar` or any subsequent element that matches `same`, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is the smallest value between its original value and the current value of `same`, and `minn` is either `inf`, the length of `ar`, or a specific integer value found in `ar`, and `int(input())` is greater than 0.**
