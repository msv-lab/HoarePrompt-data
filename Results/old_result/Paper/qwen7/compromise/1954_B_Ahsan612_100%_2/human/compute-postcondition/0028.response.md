Output State: **`same` is 3 or 1, `t` is as before, `n` is as before, `ar` is as before, `num` is as before, `minn` is 2 or unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. The initial conditions for `same` and `i` indicate that `i` could be either 5 or 6 depending on the value of `same`. After incrementing `i`, it will be 6 if it was initially 5, or 7 if it was initially 6. However, since `minn` is only mentioned in the context where `same` is 1 and `i` is 6, and there's no indication that `minn` changes unless `same` is 1, `minn` remains 2 if `same` is 1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
