Postcondition: `same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` must have more than one element, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 2 if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`; otherwise, `same` is 2, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `ar` remains unchanged, `num` remains unchanged, `minn` remains unchanged, and `i` is 2.
