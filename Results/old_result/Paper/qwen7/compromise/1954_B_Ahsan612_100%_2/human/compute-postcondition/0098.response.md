Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `minn` is infinity, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` sets the variable `minn` to infinity (`inf`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
