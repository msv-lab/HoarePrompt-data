Postcondition: `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` retain their initial values from the precondition. If `ar[i] == num`, then `same` becomes 3, and `i` is 3 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` remains 1. If `ar[i] != num`, then `same` becomes 1, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 2, and `i` is 4 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 2.
