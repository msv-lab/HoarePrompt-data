Output State: **`same` is 4 or 2, `t` is as before, `n` is as before, `ar` is as before, `num` is as before, `minn` is 2 or unchanged, and `i + 1` is less than `len(ar)`**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Since `same` was initially either 3 or 1, after executing `same += 1`, `same` will now be either 4 (if it was initially 3) or 2 (if it was initially 1). The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and the condition involving `i` remain unchanged.
