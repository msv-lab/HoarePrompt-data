Output State: The loop has executed for all test cases provided. For each test case, `minn` contains the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`. If there are no such occurrences (i.e., `minn` is infinity or equals the length of `ar`), then `minn` remains `-1`. Otherwise, `minn` holds the smallest value between the minimum count of consecutive occurrences and the length of `ar`.

The final `minn` value for each test case will be printed as the output of the respective test case. If `minn` is still infinity or equals the length of `ar` after processing all elements, the output for that test case will be `-1`.
