### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

#### Calculation for Single Yogurt Purchase:
- If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a`, which is the price of one yogurt. This is correct because if only one yogurt is needed, there's no benefit from the promotion.

#### Calculation for Multiple Yogurts Purchase:
- If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
  - `ans1 = a * n`: This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price.
  - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This represents the cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
- The program then prints the minimum of these two values, which is the optimal cost for buying `n` yogurts.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing just `a`.
- The logic for calculating `ans2` ensures that the promotion is used optimally, considering both full pairs and any leftover single yogurt.

#### Output:
- The output matches the expected format and values as shown in the example.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Single Yogurt Purchase (`n = 1`)**:
   - The program correctly prints `a` when `n` is 1. This is because buying one yogurt at the regular price is the only option.

2. **Multiple Yogurts Purchase (`n > 1`)**:
   - The calculation `ans1 = a * n` is straightforward and correct.
   - The calculation `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is also correct. Here's why:
     - `n // 2` gives the number of full pairs that can be bought at the promotional price.
     - `n % 2` gives the number of remaining single yogurts that must be bought at the regular price.
   - The minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` is printed, ensuring the optimal cost is chosen.

3. **Promotion Logic**:
   - The program correctly uses the promotion by buying as many pairs as possible and then buying the remaining single yogurts at the regular price. This ensures the minimum cost is achieved.

4. **Test Case Validation**:
   - Let's validate with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1**: `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
       - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
       - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 5 = 14`
       - Minimum cost: `min(10, 14) = 9`
     - **Example 2**: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
       - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
       - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
       - Minimum cost: `min(15, 18) = 15`
     - **Example 3**: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
       - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
       - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 21`
       - Minimum cost: `min(15, 21) = 15`
     - **Example 4**: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
       - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
       - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 5 = 27`
       - Minimum cost: `min(20, 27) = 20`

All examples match the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the regular and promotional prices. It handles all given test cases accurately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
