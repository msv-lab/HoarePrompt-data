You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts either by buying them individually or in pairs, depending on which option is cheaper. It then prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where buying in pairs (using the promotion price) is more advantageous than buying individually, especially when `n` is odd. 

For example, in the third test case of the provided example (3 5 11), the program calculates the cost as follows:
- `ans1 = a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`
- `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`

However, the correct minimum cost should be 15, which is achieved by buying two yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and one yogurt at the regular price (5 burles). The program incorrectly calculates `ans2` because it does not handle the case where the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price is more beneficial.

To fix this, the program should adjust the calculation of `ans2` to ensure it correctly handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd.
