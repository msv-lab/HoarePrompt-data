Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`. The program handles both the scenario where the number of yogurts `n` is greater than 1 and the scenario where `n` is 1, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated accurately for all test cases.
