Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, where n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price for one yogurt, and b is the price for two yogurts on promotion.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of minimum costs for purchasing different numbers of yogurts based on the given conditions. For each test case, if buying more than one yogurt, the program calculates the cost of buying each yogurt individually (ans1) or buying them in pairs with a promotion (ans2), then prints the lower of the two costs. If buying just one yogurt, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt. The process repeats for each test case provided by the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts either by buying them individually or in pairs, depending on which option is cheaper. It then prints the minimum cost for each test case.
