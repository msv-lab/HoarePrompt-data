Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to verify if a password meets the specified criteria. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Separation of Characters**: The program correctly separates the characters in the password into two lists: one for letters and one for digits.
2. **Sorting Check**: It checks whether both the list of letters and the list of digits are sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function.
3. **Character Order Check**: It iterates through the password to ensure that no alphabetic character is followed immediately by a digit. This is done by checking if the current character is alphabetic and the next character is a digit, which would result in a return of 'NO' if true.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program logic aligns perfectly with the problem statement and the examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
