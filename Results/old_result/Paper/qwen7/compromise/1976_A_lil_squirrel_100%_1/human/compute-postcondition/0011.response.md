Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`. This means that `i` should be initialized to 0 and should increment until it reaches `len(password) - 2`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - The variable `i` should be set to 0 initially.
   - The condition `i < len(password) - 1` must hold true for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state of `i` to 0. The other variables (`letters` and `digits`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0**
