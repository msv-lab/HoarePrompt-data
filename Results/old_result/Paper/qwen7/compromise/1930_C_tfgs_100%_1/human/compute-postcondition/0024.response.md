Output State: **`ans` is a list containing two elements where the second element is `a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1`, `a` retains its original value, `j` is `j + 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, where `j` is updated to `j + 2`. Since `ans` originally contained one element, after appending, it now contains two elements. The first element remains unchanged, and the second element is the newly appended value. The variable `a` and the original value of `j` before the operation remain unchanged.
