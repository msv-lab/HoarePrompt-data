Output State: **`cur` is reduced by `adv`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv - counter[a[adv]]`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[adv - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)`, `a` remains unchanged, `j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) - adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `counter[a[i]] -= 1` decreases the value of `counter[a[i]]` by 1.
- All other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `a`, `j`, `adv`) remain unchanged according to their previous definitions or expressions.
- The value of `counter[a[i]]` is now one less than its previous value.
