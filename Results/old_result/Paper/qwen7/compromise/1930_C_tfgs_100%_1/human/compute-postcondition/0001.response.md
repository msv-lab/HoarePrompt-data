Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
