Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - j - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains an additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `j` is updated to `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - j - 1)`.
- The value of `adv` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified in the given code snippet.
- The list `ans` appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, which was calculated using the current values of `a[i - 1]` and `j`.
