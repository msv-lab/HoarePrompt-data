Output State: `adv` must be greater than 0, `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `n - 1` elements, and each element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`.

In this final output state, the loop has executed until it can no longer find a valid `adv` value that is greater than 0, given the current values of `cnt` and `cur`. The list `ans` is fully populated with `n - 1` elements, where each element represents the difference between `a[i - 1]` and its adjusted index based on the current value of `adv` and `j`.
