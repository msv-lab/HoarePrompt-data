Output State: **`cur` is reduced by `adv`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv - counter[a[adv]]`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[adv - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)`, `a` remains unchanged, `j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) - adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, and `ans` is appended with `a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet appends `a[i]` to `ans`.
- All other conditions and calculations remain the same as the initial postcondition.
- Therefore, the updated `ans` now contains one more element, which is `a[i]`.
