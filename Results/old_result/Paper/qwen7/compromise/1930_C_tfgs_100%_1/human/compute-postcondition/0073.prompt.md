Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains `n` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` contains `n` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`, and `ans` now has its last element decremented by 1, `counter` is an empty dictionary.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` now has `n` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`, and the last element is decremented by 1 again, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `ans` has its last element decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` now has `n` elements where the last element is `ans[0] - 1` and all other elements remain the same, `counter` is an empty dictionary.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
