Output State: **`cnt` is reduced by `adv` and `cur` is reduced by `adv`. `ans` contains `n - 2` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1`, `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `adv - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is decremented by the value of `adv`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
