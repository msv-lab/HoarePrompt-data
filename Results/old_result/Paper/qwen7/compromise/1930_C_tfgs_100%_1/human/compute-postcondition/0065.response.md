Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains `n` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be 0 because it starts from the initial value and gets updated by adding `counter[a[i]]` in each iteration, which eventually balances out any reduction due to `adv`. Similarly, `cnt` will be 0 as it gets reduced by `adv` in each iteration until it reaches 0. The list `ans` will contain `n` elements, each calculated based on the logic inside the loop, and `counter` will be an empty dictionary since all counts of elements in `a` are decremented to 0.
