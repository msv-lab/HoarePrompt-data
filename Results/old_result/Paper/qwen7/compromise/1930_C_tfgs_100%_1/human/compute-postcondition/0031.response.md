Output State: **`cur` is reduced by `adv` and `cnt` is reduced by `adv`; `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `adv - 1`; `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `counter[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i]` in the `counter` dictionary by 1. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
