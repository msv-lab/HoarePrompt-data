You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, each element `a[j]` (where \(0 \leq j < n\)) is increased by \(j + 1\) for every iteration \(j\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, each element `a[j]` in the list `a` will have been incremented by the sum of all integers from 1 to `j + 1`. In mathematical terms, the value of `a[j]` will be `a[j] + (j + 1)`, where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)

        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains `n` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be equal to 3, `ans` now has `n` elements where the last element is `ans[0] - 2` and all other elements remain the same, `counter` is an empty dictionary.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all 3 iterations, `cnt` will be 3. The loop body decrements the last element of `ans` in each iteration. Since the loop runs 3 times, the last element of `ans` will be decremented by 3 from its initial value, resulting in `ans[0] - 2`. All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: x y1 y2 ... yn-1 x-2



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Initial Conditions:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the array `a` itself.
   
2. **Modifying Array Elements:**
   - It modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1`, effectively performing the operation `a_i + i`.

3. **Using a Counter and Set:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified value.
   - It converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Result Array `b`:**
   - It iterates through the sorted list and constructs the result array `ans` by ensuring the maximum possible values are placed first.
   - It handles the case where there are remaining elements to add to the result array by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the constructed array `ans`.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Modification of Array Elements:**
   - The modification `a[i] += i + 1` is correctly implemented and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Using a `set` to remove duplicates ensures that each value in the set is unique, as required by the problem statement.

3. **Sorting and Constructing `b`:**
   - Sorting the set in descending order and constructing the result array `ans` in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order is correct. The logic for handling remaining elements and ensuring the maximum values are placed first is sound.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when there are remaining elements to add to the result array by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input, modifies the array elements, removes duplicates, sorts them, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` as required.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
