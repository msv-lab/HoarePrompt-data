Output State: **`extroverts` is decreased by the number of `universals`, `ret` is the result of the function call `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `extroverts` and `universals`. The function call returns a value which is assigned to the variable `ret`. The value of `extroverts` is decreased by the number of `universals`. The initial values of `introverts` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
