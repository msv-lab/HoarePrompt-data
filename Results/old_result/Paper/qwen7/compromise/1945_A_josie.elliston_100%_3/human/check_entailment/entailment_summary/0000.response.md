Reasoning:
1. Let's analyze the logic of `func_1`:
   - It checks if the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is divisible by 3.
   - If not, it further checks if adding the number of universals to the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 is still less than 3. If this condition is met, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

2. Now let's look at `func_2`:
   - It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and some universals in a way that satisfies the conditions, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` and returns this sum.

3. The overall logic seems to correctly handle the constraints:
   - Introverts need individual tents, so they are directly added to the count.
   - Extroverts require a tent with two others, and `func_1` correctly calculates how many such tents are needed.
   - Universals can be flexible, and `func_1` ensures they can fill in the remaining spots in the tents.

4. The example test cases provided also align with the logic of the functions:
   - For instance, in the first test case, 1 introvert needs 1 tent, and the remaining participants (2 extroverts and 3 universals) can be accommodated in 2 more tents, totaling 3 tents.
   - In the second test case, it fails because 4 extroverts cannot be paired with universals to form complete tents.

Given that the functions seem to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement and the examples provided also validate the logic, the given program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
