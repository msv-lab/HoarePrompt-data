Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - It then iterates over values of `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, and for each `b`, it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly represent the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This expression is overly simplistic and does not account for the actual gcd condition.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
     - The expected output is 14, but the program's logic would incorrectly compute a much smaller value due to the flawed calculation.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
