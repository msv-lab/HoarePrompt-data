Reasoning:
1. The given program aims to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. However, the program provided does not correctly implement the logic to solve this problem. Specifically, the program uses a loop to iterate through values of \(b\) from 2 to the minimum of \(n\) and \(m\), and it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each \(b\). This calculation does not align with the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the problem statement, the correct approach involves iterating through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition directly. The provided solution does not do this and instead uses an incorrect heuristic.

Correctness: **False**
