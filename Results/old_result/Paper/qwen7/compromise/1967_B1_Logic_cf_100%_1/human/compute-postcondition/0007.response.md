Output State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `n` must be such that min(n, m) is at least 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. However, since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we only know that `n` must be such that the minimum of `n` and `m` is at least 2. The value of `b` is also not specified, so it remains unchanged.
