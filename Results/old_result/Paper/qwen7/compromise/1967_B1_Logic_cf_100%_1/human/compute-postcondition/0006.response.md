Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `b`, `2`, `min(n, m)`, and `+1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `b` is the loop variable that starts from 2 and increments.
   - `2` is the starting value of `b`.
   - `min(n, m)` is the ending condition for the loop.
   - `+1` indicates that the loop runs until `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `b` must start from 2 and increment until it is less than `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - Therefore, `b` should start from 2, and `min(n, m)` must be at least 2 for the loop to run.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `b` starts from 2, no adjustment is needed for `b` itself.
   - We need to ensure that `min(n, m)` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
- `n` is an integer value converted from the original string input.
- `ans` is equal to `n` (not relevant to the loop).

The only relevant variables for the loop are `b`, `2`, `min(n, m)`, and `+1`. To ensure the loop can execute, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` must be such that min(n, m) is at least 2**
