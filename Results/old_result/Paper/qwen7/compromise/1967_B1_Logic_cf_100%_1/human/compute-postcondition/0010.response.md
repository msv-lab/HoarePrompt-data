Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `b` and the range it iterates over, which is from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`
   - `b` is updated to `b + 1`
   - `min(n, m)` remains the same

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `b` is within the range from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `b` is updated to `b + 1` at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `b` will be `b + 1`.
   - The value of `min(n, m)` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `b`.

Given the current state:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`
- `b` is updated to `b + 1`
- `min(n, m)` remains the same

For the next iteration, `b` will be `b + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `b` will be `b + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `b` (which is `b + 1`).
- `b` will be `b + 1`.
- `min(n, m)` remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + (n + (b + 1)) // ((b + 1) * (b + 1))`, `b` is `b + 1`, `min(n, m)` remains the same**
