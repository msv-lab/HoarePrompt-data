Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `b` and the range `2` to `min(n, m) + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated by the expression `ans + (n + 2) // (2 * 2) + (n + 3) // (3 * 3)`.
   - `b` is `3`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `min(n, m)` must be at least 5.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `b` is within the range `2` to `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is `3`.

4. **Determine the next value of `b`**:
   - Since `b` starts from `2` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `b` would be `4`.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `b` must be within the range `2` to `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - Given that `b` is now `4`, it depends on whether `min(n, m)` is at least `4`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged since the loop body is omitted.
   - `b` changes to `4`.
   - `n` remains an integer.
   - `min(n, m)` must still be at least 5 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + 2) // (2 * 2) + (n + 3) // (3 * 3)`, `b` is 4, `n` is an integer, and min(`n`, `m`) must be at least 5**
