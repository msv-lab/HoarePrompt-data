Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all \( b \) in the range from 2 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \), and prints the result. If the input constraints are not satisfied, the function will not execute correctly.**
