Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 2.
   - `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 2.
   - `ans` is updated by `ans + (n + 2) // (2 * 2)`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - Since `b` starts at 2 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `b` is currently 2, it means the loop has just started or completed its first iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be 3.
   - The value of `min(n, m)` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop, so `min(n, m)` must still be at least 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `b` needs to be 3.
   - `n` and `m` must still satisfy the condition that `min(n, m)` is at least 2.

6. **Consider the effect on `ans`**:
   - The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + 2) // (2 * 2)` in each iteration. Since the loop has just started or completed its first iteration, the value of `ans` remains unchanged from the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`b` is 3, `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 2, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 2, `ans` is `ans + (n + 2) // (2 * 2)**
