Output State: `ans` is the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)`, inclusive, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `n` is an integer, and `m` is an integer with the condition that `min(n, m)` must be at least 5.

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the sum of the expressions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each value of `b` starting from 2 up to the smaller of `n` and `m`. The variable `b` will take on each integer value in this range, and after the loop completes, `ans` will contain the total sum of these expressions.
