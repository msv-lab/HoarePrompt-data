You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list in ascending order and converts each integer to a string. Then, it prints the sorted list as a single line of space-separated strings. The function handles up to 500 test cases, with each test case containing between 2 and 100 integers, and each integer being between 1 and 10^9. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this, we should arrange the array such that the largest values are placed at the beginning and the smallest values are placed at the end, because the differences will be maximized when the largest values come first.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \).
3. It reads the array elements.
4. It sorts the array and converts it to a string representation.
5. It prints the sorted array as a space-separated string.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Sorting and Rearranging**: The program sorts the array but does not rearrange the elements to maximize the beauty. Instead, it simply prints the sorted array, which does not achieve the desired result.
2. **Output Format**: The program outputs the sorted array as a space-separated string, which is not required by the problem statement. The problem asks for the maximum beauty value, not the sorted array itself.
3. **Calculation of Beauty**: The program does not calculate the beauty of the array after sorting, so it cannot provide the correct answer.

### Correct Solution
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the size of the array and its elements.
3. Sort the array.
4. Calculate the beauty of the array by computing the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
5. Output the maximum beauty for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
