### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the given program:

1. **Sorting and Rearranging**: The program sorts the array but does not rearrange the elements to maximize the beauty.
2. **Output Format**: The program outputs the sorted array as a space-separated string, which is not required by the problem statement.
3. **Calculation of Beauty**: The program does not calculate the beauty of the array after sorting.

However, the original assessment did not provide a fully correct solution. The suggested corrected version of the program is indeed correct, but the original assessment did not explicitly state that the given program was incorrect. 

Given the problem description and the function summary, the original program does not meet the requirements of the problem. The original program sorts the array but does not compute the beauty, and it prints the sorted array instead of the calculated beauty.

### Final Evaluation

Since the original program does not correctly solve the problem as described, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**

This conclusion is based on the fact that the original program does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array and instead prints the sorted array, which is not the required output.
