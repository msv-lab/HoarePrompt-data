Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a string, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, we should focus on maximizing the expression \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key observation is that the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array such that the largest element is paired with the smallest element, the second largest with the second smallest, and so on. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        max_beauty = sum(abs(ar[i] - ar[i-1]) for i in range(1, n))
        print(max_beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself. It sorts the array and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
