Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks without breaking any stick.
- A regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length.
- The solution should count the frequency of each stick length and then determine how many complete sets of 3 (minimum for a triangle) can be formed from these frequencies.
- The current implementation of `func_1` correctly counts the frequency of each stick length and then divides each frequency by 3 to find out how many complete triangles (the smallest regular polygon) can be formed from each length.
- However, the logic needs to consider the possibility of forming other types of polygons (e.g., squares, pentagons, etc.) which would require different multiples of the stick lengths.
- The current implementation only considers triangles (3-sided polygons), but it does not account for other possible polygons like squares (4-sided), pentagons (5-sided), etc.

Given the above points, the current implementation is incomplete and does not fully solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
