#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, and the number of sticks (n) is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of unique stick lengths encountered (n), and the subsequent elements are the unique stick lengths (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) in ascending order; `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a stick length from `arr` and its value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in the original list.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3, where each frequency is the count of occurrences of a unique stick length in the original list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` where the first element indicates the number of sticks and the subsequent elements are the lengths of these sticks. It calculates and returns the sum of the integer division of each unique stick length's frequency by 3.
