Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x + 1` times starting from `s = 1`, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state of `i` and `s` remains unchanged. The value of `s` is calculated based on the given operation, but since the operation is not performed in the provided code snippet, the initial state of `s` is kept as described. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are now input integers.
