Output State: `i` is `x - 1`, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x` times starting from `s = 1`.

To explain this output state in more detail:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `x - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`, inclusive.
- The variable `x` must remain greater than 0 as it is a condition for the loop to continue executing.
- The variable `s` will be the final value obtained after performing the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` exactly `x` times, starting with `s = 1`. This means `s` will go through the transformation defined by the loop body `x` times.
