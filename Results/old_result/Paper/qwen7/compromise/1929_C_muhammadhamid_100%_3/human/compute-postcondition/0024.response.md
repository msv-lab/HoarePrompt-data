Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`. However, since the exact value of `int(input())` is not provided, we will denote it as `x`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is `x - 1`
   - `x` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x` times starting from `s = 1`

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`, the next value of `i` will be `x`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged unless the input changes, but since no new input is provided, `x` stays the same.
   - The variable `s` will undergo the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` one more time.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `x` (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).
- `x` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
- `s` will be updated by the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x+1` times starting from `s = 1`.**
