Output State: `i` is `x-1`, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x` times starting from `s = 1`.

To explain this in more detail:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `x-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`.
- The variable `x` remains greater than 0 as it was initially and no changes were made to it within the loop.
- The variable `s` undergoes the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` exactly `x` times, starting with `s = 1`. This means `s` will be updated in each iteration according to the given formula until the loop completes.
