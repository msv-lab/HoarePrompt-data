Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` must be greater than 1
   - `s` is 2 * `s // (k - 1) + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Consider the value of `s`**: The value of `s` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Based on these steps, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 1, `s` is 2 * `s // (k - 1) + 1`**
