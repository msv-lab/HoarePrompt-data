Output State: The loop will execute `x` times, `i` will be equal to `x - 1`, `x` remains unchanged, and `s` will be \(2^x - 1\). The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `x - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`, inclusive. The variable `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `s` will be the result of performing the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x` times, starting from `s = 1`. This results in `s` being \(2^x - 1\) after `x` iterations. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop operations.
