Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(x):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Consider the effect on `s`**: The value of `s` is determined by an external expression and does not directly depend on the loop variables `i` or `x`. Therefore, `s` remains unchanged for the purpose of determining the loop continuation.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `x`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 0**
