Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `s`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `s` and `k`. Since `s` is updated based on its current value and the value of `k`, the new value of `s` is expressed as `s // (k - 1) + 1`. The variables `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
