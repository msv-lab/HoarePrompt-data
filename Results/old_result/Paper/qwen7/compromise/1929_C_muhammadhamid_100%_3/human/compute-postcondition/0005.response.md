Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is a positive integer
   - `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `x`. Since `i` is now 1, `x` must be greater than 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `x` must be greater than 1.
   - The value of `s` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1`**
