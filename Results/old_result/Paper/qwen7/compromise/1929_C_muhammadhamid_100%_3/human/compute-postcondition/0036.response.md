Based on the initial state provided:

- The value of `s` is 8.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `i` is 5.

The code snippet to be analyzed is:
```python
print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is explicitly given as 8.
- `a` is not defined in the initial state, but we need to determine its value relative to `s`.

Since `a` is not defined in the initial state and there is no additional information about its value, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can still analyze the print statement based on the value of `s`.

The print statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is 8, the statement will evaluate to `'Yes'` if `a` is greater than or equal to 8, and `'No'` otherwise.

Given the lack of specific information about `a`, the most precise description of the output is based on the condition `a >= s`.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= 8 else 'No'**
