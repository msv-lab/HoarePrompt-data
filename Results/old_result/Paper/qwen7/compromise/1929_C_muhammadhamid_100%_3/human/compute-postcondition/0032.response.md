Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop condition. In this case, the loop head involves `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current values of the loop variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is 4.
   - `k` is an input integer (its value is not relevant for adjusting the loop state).
   - `x` is an input integer (its value is not relevant for adjusting the loop state).
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but it does not need to be adjusted here since we are only concerned with the loop head variables.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `s` remains 4.
   - `k` remains an input integer.
   - `x` remains an input integer.
   - `i` is incremented to 4.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is 4, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 4**
