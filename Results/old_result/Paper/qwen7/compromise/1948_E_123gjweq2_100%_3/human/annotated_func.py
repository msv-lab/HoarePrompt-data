#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 40, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` with values based on the given parameters.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cliques` is equal to ceil(`n` / `k`), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 40, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n, `arr` is a list of length `n` where each element is set to `cliquess[i]` which is `cliques`, and `cliquess` is a list of `n` ones.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = cliques - 1`. For each iteration, it calls the function `make_array` with parameters `i * k`, `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, and `i + 1`. This function presumably modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` lists. Since the details of `make_array` are not provided, we can infer that it sets each element in `arr` to `cliques` and each element in `cliquess` to `i + 1`. However, based on the given information, it seems more likely that each element in `cliquess` is set to `cliques`, making all elements in `cliquess` equal to `cliques`. Each element in `arr` is set to `cliques`, making `arr` a list of `n` zeros transformed into a list of `n` ones.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: ceil(n / k)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 40` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`. It then calls the `make_array` function to fill `arr` with the value `1` and `cliquess` with the value `ceil(n / k)`. Finally, it prints the contents of `arr`, the calculated number of cliques, and the contents of `cliquess`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that left < right and both are within the range [0, n-1]. clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right` and both are within the range [0, n-1], `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is modified such that for each `i` in the range `[0, mid)`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is set to `small_element + i` and `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right` and both are within the range [0, n-1], `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is modified such that for each `i` in the range `[0, not_mid)`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` based on these parameters. Specifically, it sets elements in `arr` to values between `small_element` and `big_element` in a specific pattern determined by `mid` and `not_mid`. Additionally, it assigns the value of `clique` to corresponding indices in `cliquess`. After the function executes, the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are updated according to the described pattern.
