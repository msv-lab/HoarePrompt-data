You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` based on these parameters. Specifically, it sets elements in `arr` to values between `small_element` and `big_element` in a specific pattern determined by `mid` and `not_mid`. Additionally, it assigns the value of `clique` to corresponding indices in `cliquess`. After the function executes, the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are updated according to the described pattern.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to each vertex.
   - The graph must satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for every pair of vertices \( (i, j) \) to be connected.
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.

2. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The function `func_1` should correctly calculate the number of cliques and assign the integers to vertices.
   - The function `make_array` should correctly fill the array and assign the clique labels.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)` calculates the minimum number of cliques needed.
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to zero.
   - The loop iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the arrays.

4. **Analysis of `make_array`:**
   - It fills the array `arr` and assigns clique labels to `cliquess`.
   - The logic inside `make_array` seems to distribute elements in a way that might not always satisfy the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

5. **Testing the Logic:**
   - Let's test the program with the provided examples:
     - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):
       - Expected output: \( 2 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \)
       - Actual output: \( 2 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \)
     - For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \):
       - Expected output: \( 3 \ 1 \ 5 \ 2 \ 4 \ 2 \)
       - Actual output: \( 3 \ 1 \ 5 \ 2 \ 4 \ 2 \)
     - For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \):
       - Expected output: \( 1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 8 \ 1 \)
       - Actual output: \( 1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 8 \ 1 \)

6. **Verification:**
   - The program does not seem to handle the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) correctly. The logic in `make_array` might not ensure that all pairs within the same clique satisfy this condition.
   - The output does not always form a valid graph according to the given constraints.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
