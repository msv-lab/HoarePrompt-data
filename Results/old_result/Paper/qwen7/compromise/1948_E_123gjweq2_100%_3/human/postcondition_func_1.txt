The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` based on these parameters. Specifically, it sets elements in `arr` to values between `small_element` and `big_element` in a specific pattern determined by `mid` and `not_mid`. Additionally, it assigns the value of `clique` to corresponding indices in `cliquess`. After the function executes, the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are updated according to the described pattern.
