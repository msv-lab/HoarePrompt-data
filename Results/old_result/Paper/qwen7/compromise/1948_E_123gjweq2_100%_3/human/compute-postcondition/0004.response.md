Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `mid`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.

3. **Determine the value of `mid`**: The value of `mid` is given as `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`. Since `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, we can express `mid` as:
   \[
   mid = \frac{(right + 1) - (left + 1) + 1}{2} = \frac{right - left + 1}{2}
   \]
   For the loop to execute, `mid` must be a positive integer, meaning `right - left + 1` must be even.

4. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: The loop will execute as long as `i < mid`. Since `i` starts at 0, `mid` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `mid` is a positive integer. The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `not_mid`) do not directly affect the loop execution and can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `mid` must be a positive integer**
