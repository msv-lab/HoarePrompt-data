The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. Both `left` and `right` are integers such that `left < right` and they are within the range [0, n-1], where `n` is some specified upper limit. The parameter `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier. The function does not explicitly return any value based on the given information, but rather constructs an array or performs some operation involving these parameters.
