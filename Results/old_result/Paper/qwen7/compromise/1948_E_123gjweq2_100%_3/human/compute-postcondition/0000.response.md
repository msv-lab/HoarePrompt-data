Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right` and both are within the range [0, n-1], `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, and `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

This means that the value of `small_element` has been updated to be `left + 1`, while the values of `left`, `right`, and `clique` remain unchanged from their initial state.
