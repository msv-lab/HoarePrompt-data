Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right` and both are within the range [0, n-1], `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `mid` as `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`. Given that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, the expression simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, which further simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged.
