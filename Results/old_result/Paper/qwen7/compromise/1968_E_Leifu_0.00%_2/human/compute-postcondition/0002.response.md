Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50. The variable `i` remains 0.
