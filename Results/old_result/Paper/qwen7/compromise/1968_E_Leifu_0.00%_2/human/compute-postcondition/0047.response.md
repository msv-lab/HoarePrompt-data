Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the variables that are relevant for the loop condition. In this case, the loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(4, n + 1):
   ```
   The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
   - `t` must be greater than 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `n` must be at least 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` from 4 to `n` inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within this range.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 4 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 5 if the loop executes again.
   - The value of `n` remains the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `t` must be greater than 2 (unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `j` is 5 (since `j` starts from 4 and increments by 1).
- `n` must be at least 4 (unchanged).

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `n` must be at least 4**
