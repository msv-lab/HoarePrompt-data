Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than 3, and `j` must be equal to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `j` will take the value of `n`, as the loop increments `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), and the loop runs until `j` reaches `n`. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
