Output State: `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 4.

After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `j` from 4 to `n` in steps of 1. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
