Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than 3, and `j` must be equal to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will not be affected since it is not used within the loop. The loop variable `j` will iterate from 4 to `n` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`. The conditions for `t` and `n` remain the same as they were initially and are not altered by the loop.
