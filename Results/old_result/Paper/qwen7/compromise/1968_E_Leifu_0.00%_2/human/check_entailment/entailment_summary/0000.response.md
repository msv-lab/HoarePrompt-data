Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and the constraints specified.
2. For \( n = 2 \), the program prints '1 1' and '1 2', which indeed maximizes the Manhattan distance set \(\mathcal{H}\) to \{0, 1\}.
3. For \( n = 3 \), the program prints '1 1', '1 2', and '2 3', which also maximizes \(\mathcal{H}\) to \{0, 1, 3\}.
4. For \( n > 3 \), the program prints '1 1', '1 2', '2 4', and 'j j' for \( j \) ranging from 4 to \( n \). This configuration ensures that the Manhattan distances include values from 0 up to \( n-1 \).

Given these observations, the program seems to handle different values of \( n \) appropriately and should maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) as required.

Correctness: **True**
