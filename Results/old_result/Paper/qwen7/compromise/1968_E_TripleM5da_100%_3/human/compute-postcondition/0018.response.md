Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 3

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
