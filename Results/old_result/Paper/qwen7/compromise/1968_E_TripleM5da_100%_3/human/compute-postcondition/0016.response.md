Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(3, n + 1)`. This means `i` will take values from 3 to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state before the loop starts, `i` is `n + 1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(3, n + 1)`. Specifically, the loop will start when `i` is 3 and continue until `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that `i` is initially `n + 1`, it is greater than `n` (since `n + 1 > n`). Therefore, the loop will not execute because `i` will never enter the range `3` to `n`.

5. **State adjustment**: To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be within the range `3` to `n`. This means `i` should be set to `3` (the minimum value of the range) or any value between `3` and `n` (inclusive). Additionally, `n` must be at least `3` to allow the loop to start.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
