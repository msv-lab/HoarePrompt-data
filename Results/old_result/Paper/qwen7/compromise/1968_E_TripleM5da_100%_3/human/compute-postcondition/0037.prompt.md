Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(1, 1)
    print(1, 2)
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        print(i, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` will be `n`, `n` must be greater than 4.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop starts from 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. Therefore, if the loop runs all the way to completion, `i` will end up being `n`. Additionally, for the loop to run all iterations, `n` must be greater than 4, as the loop starts from 3 and needs at least one full cycle to reach `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 5.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n + 1`. This is because the loop starts with `i` as 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. If the loop executes until the end, it means `i` has been incremented enough times to reach `n + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to run through all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The value of `i` will be `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 5.

After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. Since the loop runs from 3 to `n` (inclusive), it will execute `n - 2` times. After these iterations, `i` will be set to `n + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
