Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, if \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \), it prints specific pairs of integers. Specifically, it prints "1 1", "1 2", followed by pairs "i i" for \( i \) ranging from 3 to \( n \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
