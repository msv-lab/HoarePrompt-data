Reasoning:
1. The program iterates over the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
3. The program prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` as the first two points.
4. Then, it enters a loop from `3` to `n` (inclusive) and prints points of the form `(i, i)` for each `i` in this range.

Let's analyze whether this approach maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\):

- For \(n = 2\): The points printed are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). The Manhattan distances are:
  - Distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 1)\): \(0\)
  - Distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(1\)
  - Distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(0\)

  So, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This matches the optimal solution.

- For \(n = 3\): The points printed are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\). The Manhattan distances are:
  - Distances involving \((1, 1)\): \(0, 1, 2\)
  - Distances involving \((1, 2)\): \(1, 1, 2\)
  - Distances involving \((3, 3)\): \(2, 2, 0\)

  So, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3. This also matches the optimal solution.

- For \(n = 4\): The points printed are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\). The Manhattan distances include:
  - Distances involving \((1, 1)\): \(0, 1, 2, 3\)
  - Distances involving \((1, 2)\): \(1, 1, 2, 3\)
  - Distances involving \((3, 3)\): \(2, 2, 0, 2\)
  - Distances involving \((4, 4)\): \(3, 3, 2, 0\)

  So, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This again matches the optimal solution.

- For \(n = 5\): The points printed are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\). The Manhattan distances include:
  - Distances involving \((1, 1)\): \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4\)
  - Distances involving \((1, 2)\): \(1, 1, 2, 3, 4\)
  - Distances involving \((3, 3)\): \(2, 2, 0, 2, 2\)
  - Distances involving \((4, 4)\): \(3, 3, 2, 0, 2\)
  - Distances involving \((5, 5)\): \(4, 4, 2, 2, 0\)

  So, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 5. This matches the optimal solution.

- For \(n = 6\): The points printed are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\). The Manhattan distances include:
  - Distances involving \((1, 1)\): \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\)
  - Distances involving \((1, 2)\): \(1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\)
  - Distances involving \((3, 3)\): \(2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2\)
  - Distances involving \((4, 4)\): \(3, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2\)
  - Distances involving \((5, 5)\): \(4, 4, 2, 2, 0, 2\)
  - Distances involving \((6, 6)\): \(5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0\)

  So, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which has a size of 6. This matches the optimal solution.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly prints the points that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all tested values of \(n\).
