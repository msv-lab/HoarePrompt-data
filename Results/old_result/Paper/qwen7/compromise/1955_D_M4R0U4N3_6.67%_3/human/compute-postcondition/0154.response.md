Postcondition: `ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is added to the `todo` set, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k. If `old` is found in the `done` list, `ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 1`, `old` is added to the `todo` set, and the other lists remain unchanged.
