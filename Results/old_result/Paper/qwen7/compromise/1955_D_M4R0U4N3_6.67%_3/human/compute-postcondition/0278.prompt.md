Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: All elements in `a` have been processed, meaning `todo` is empty and all elements originally in `todo` are now in `done`. The variable `extra` contains all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially. The variable `ans` is equal to 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0. The loop has executed `n - m` times, with `r` starting from `m` and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`.

This means that after the loop completes, `old` will be the last element processed (`a[n - 1]`), and the conditions described for the final iteration apply. Specifically, if `a[n - 1]` was in `extra`, it would have been removed, and `todo` would include `a[n - 1]`. If `a[n - 1]` was in `done`, it would have been moved to `todo` and possibly removed from `done`. If `a[n - 1]` was not in `todo` or `done`, it would have been added to `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All iterations of the loop have completed, with `ans` being 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise. The variable `r` will be equal to `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `r` will be equal to `n`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`. The variable `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the length of `done` reaches or exceeds `k`. `todo` will contain elements that were originally in `a` but are neither in `done` nor `extra`. `done` will contain elements that were moved from `todo` to `done` as per the conditions inside the loop. `extra` will contain elements from `a` that were never in `todo`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
