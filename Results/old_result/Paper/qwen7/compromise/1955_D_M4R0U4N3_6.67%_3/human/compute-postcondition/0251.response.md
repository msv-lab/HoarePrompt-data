Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `todo` remains unchanged, `done` now includes the element `a[r - m]`, and `extra` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[r - m]` to the set `done`. The values of `r`, `m`, `n`, `todo`, and `extra` remain unchanged from their initial states.
