Output State: **`old` is not in `done`, and `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, and `old` is not in `extra`.**

Explanation: The code removes `old` from the list `done`. Since `old` was previously in `done`, after executing `done.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer in `done`. The other conditions (that `old` is equal to `a[r - m]` and `old` is not in `extra`) remain unchanged.
