Output State: **`todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` contains the element `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is in `todo`, otherwise it is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0; `j` is `j_prev + 1`; `extra` now contains `a[j]`.**

Explanation: The line `extra.add(a[j])` adds the value of `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Since `j` is defined as `j_prev + 1`, `a[j]` is the next element in the list `a` after `a[j_prev]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
