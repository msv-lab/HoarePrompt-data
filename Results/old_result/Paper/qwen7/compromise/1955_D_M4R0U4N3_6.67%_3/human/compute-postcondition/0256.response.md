Postcondition: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` remains unchanged, `done` now includes the element `a[r - m]`, and `extra` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`, and if `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain `old`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo` and `done` has had the element `old` removed. If `old` is not in `done`, no changes are made to `todo` and `done`.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the if-else block, stating that regardless of whether the condition `len(done) >= k` is true or false, the operations specified in the if part will be executed. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains consistent with the operations defined in the if part.
