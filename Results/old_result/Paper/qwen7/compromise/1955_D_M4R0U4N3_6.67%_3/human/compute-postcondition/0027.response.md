Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were originally in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were not in `todo`, `m` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `j` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `m-1`), `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0` checks if the length of the `done` set is greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. The values of `t`, `a`, `todo`, `extra`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged from their previous states.
