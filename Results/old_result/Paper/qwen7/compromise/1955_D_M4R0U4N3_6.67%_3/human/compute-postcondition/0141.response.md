Output State: **`r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `extra` now contains `a[r]`, if `old` is still in `extra`, then `old` is in `todo` and either in `done` but has been removed from `done`, or `old` is not in `done`. If `old` is no longer present in `extra`, then `old` is either in `todo` and has not been moved from `todo` to `done`, or `old` is in `todo` but not in `done`.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This changes the content of the set `extra` to include `a[r]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
