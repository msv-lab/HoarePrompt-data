Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `todo = set(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a set from these integers. The set `todo` now contains these integers, while the other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
