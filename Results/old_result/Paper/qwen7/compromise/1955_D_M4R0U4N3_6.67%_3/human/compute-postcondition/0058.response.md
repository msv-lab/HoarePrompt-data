Output State: **`old` is no longer in `extra`, `r` is `m + 1`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged if the length of `done` is less than `k`**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` was originally equal to `a[r - m]` and `r` is `m + 1`, the value of `a[r]` (which is `a[m + 1]`) is no longer part of the `extra` list. All other variables (`todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as per the initial state, provided the length of `done` is less than `k`.
