Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 2`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `done` list has removed the element `old`, `todo` and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the `old` element has been removed from the `done` list, while all other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
