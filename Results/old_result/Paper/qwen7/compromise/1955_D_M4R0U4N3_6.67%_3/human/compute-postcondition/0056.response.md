Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over `r` from `m` to `n`. Therefore, the relevant variables are `r`, `a[r]`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans`.

2. **Understand the conditions inside the loop**:
   - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `old` remains unchanged and is not in `extra`.
   - If `a[r]` is in `done`, `old` is added to `todo`.
   - If `a[r]` is in `extra`, `old` remains in `extra`.
   - If `a[r]` is not in `todo` or `done` and not in `extra`, `old` remains unchanged and is not in `extra`.
   - If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `r` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - `a[r]` will be the value at the new position of `r`.
   - `todo`, `done`, and `extra` will remain unchanged unless `a[r]` meets certain conditions.
   - `ans` will only be incremented if the length of `done` is already greater than or equal to `k`.

Given that `old` is equal to `a[r - m]` at the end of the previous iteration, and assuming `r` starts at `m` in the next iteration, `r` will be `m + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `a[r]` will be `a[m + 1]`.

Since the loop condition does not change the values of `todo`, `done`, and `extra` unless specific conditions are met, these values remain the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`old` is equal to `a[m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged if the length of `done` is less than `k`**.
