Output State: **`old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `todo` contains the value of `old` if `old` is in `extra`, `done` does not contain the value of `old`, `a[r]` is now `a[r]` added to `extra`, `extra` has the new element `a[r]`, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Since `r` is `m + 1`, `a[r]` is equivalent to `a[m + 1]`. The other variables (`old`, `todo`, `done`, `a[r - m]`, `extra`, and `ans`) remain unchanged in their respective conditions.
