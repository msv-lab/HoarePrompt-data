Output State: **`old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `todo` does not contain the value of `old`, `done` either does not contain the value of `old` or contains it, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `extra`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `a[r]` from the `todo` set. Since `r` is defined as `m + 1`, `a[r]` is equivalent to `a[m + 1]`. The value of `old` was previously in `todo`, so after removing it, `todo` no longer contains `old`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
