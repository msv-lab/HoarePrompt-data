Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is removed from the `extra` list, `todo` is updated to remove `a[r]`, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the `todo` set. Since `r` is equal to `m + 1`, `r` is updated to `m + 1`. Also, since `old` is either removed from the `extra` list or added to the `todo` set, and now `old` is being removed from the `todo` set, the value of `ans` is increased by 1 again. The conditions regarding `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain unchanged.
