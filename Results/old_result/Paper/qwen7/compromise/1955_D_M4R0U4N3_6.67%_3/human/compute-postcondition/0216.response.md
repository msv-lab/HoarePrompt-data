Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than `m`, `old` is not in `extra`**.

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` was previously in `extra`, after executing `extra.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer in `extra`. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
