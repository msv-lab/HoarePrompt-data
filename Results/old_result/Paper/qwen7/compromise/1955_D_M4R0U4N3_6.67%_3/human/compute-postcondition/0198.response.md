Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - If `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `a[0]` and `done` contains `a[0]`. Otherwise, `a[0]` is added to `extra` and `extra` contains the element `a[0]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(m):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1.
   - `m` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

5. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.

6. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The conditions related to `a[0]`, `todo`, and `done` or `extra` do not change based on the loop iteration itself but rather depend on the loop body, which is omitted here. These conditions remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `j` and `m`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0**
