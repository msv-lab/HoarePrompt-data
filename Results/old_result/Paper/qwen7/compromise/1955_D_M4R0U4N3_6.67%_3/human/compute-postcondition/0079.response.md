Postcondition: `ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, and if `old` is in `extra`, `extra` may have lost an element `a[m + 2]`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` now includes `old`, and `old` is removed from the `done` set. If `old` is not in the `done` set, the values of `ans`, `r`, `a[r]`, and `todo` remain unchanged, and `old` remains in the `done` set.
