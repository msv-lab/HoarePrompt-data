Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `extra` now contains the element `a[r]`, and all other conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Here, `r` is defined as `m + 2`, so `a[r]` refers to the element at index `m + 2` in the list `a`. The other conditions (`m <= n`, `n > m`, and the checks involving `old`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo`) remain unchanged as the code does not affect these variables or conditions.
