Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `old` is not in `a[r - m]`, `done` has had the element `old` removed.**

Explanation: The line `done.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `done`. Since `old` was defined as `a[r - m]`, after executing this line, `old` is no longer in `done`. The values of `r`, `m`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
