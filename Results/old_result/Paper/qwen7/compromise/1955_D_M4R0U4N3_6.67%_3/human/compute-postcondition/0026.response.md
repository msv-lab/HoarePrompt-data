Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were originally in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were not in `todo`, `m` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `j` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `m-1`).

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop, `todo` will contain no elements since all elements that were initially in `todo` have been removed and added to `done`. The `done` set will contain all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`. The `extra` set will contain all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially. The variable `m` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, and `j` will be the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `m-1`).
