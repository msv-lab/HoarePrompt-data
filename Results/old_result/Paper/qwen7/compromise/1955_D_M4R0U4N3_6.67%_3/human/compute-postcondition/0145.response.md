Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `old` is either in `todo` and has been moved from `todo` to `done`, or `old` is in `todo` but not in `done`. If `old` is still in `extra`, then `old` is in `todo` and either in `done` but has been removed from `done`, or `old` is not in `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`, and if `old` is still in `extra`, then `old` is in `todo` and either in `done` but has been removed from `done`, or `old` is not in `done`. If `old` is no longer present in `extra`, then `old` is either in `todo` and has not been moved from `todo` to `done`, or `old` is in `todo` but not in `done`. Additionally, the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.
