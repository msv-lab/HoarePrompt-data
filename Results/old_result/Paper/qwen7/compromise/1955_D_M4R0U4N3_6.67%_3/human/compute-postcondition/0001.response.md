Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are set to the integers obtained from the input.
