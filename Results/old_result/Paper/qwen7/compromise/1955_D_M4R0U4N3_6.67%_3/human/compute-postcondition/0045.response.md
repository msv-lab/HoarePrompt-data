Output State: **`old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `old` is not in `extra`, `old` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is not in `todo`**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. Since `a[r]` was previously in `todo`, it is no longer there after the removal. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
