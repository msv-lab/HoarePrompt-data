Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 2`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `extra` list has removed the element `old`, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the `extra` list has had its `old` element removed, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their previous states.
