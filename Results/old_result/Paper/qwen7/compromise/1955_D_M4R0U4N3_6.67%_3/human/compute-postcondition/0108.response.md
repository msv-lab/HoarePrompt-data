Output State: **`todo` is a set of integers from user input with one element removed, `done` contains the element `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is in `todo`, otherwise it is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the `todo` set has had one element removed, which is `a[j]`. The values of `done`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states unless the removal of `a[j]` from `todo` affects the conditions that determine the values of `done` and `ans`. However, since the exact elements of `todo` and the value of `a[j_prev + 1]` are not specified, we cannot definitively state changes to `done` and `ans` without more information.
