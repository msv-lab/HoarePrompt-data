Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input, `done` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes `done` as an empty set. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `r`, `a`, or `todo`. Therefore, the conditions for `ans` remain the same, and the values of `r`, `a`, and `todo` stay unchanged.
