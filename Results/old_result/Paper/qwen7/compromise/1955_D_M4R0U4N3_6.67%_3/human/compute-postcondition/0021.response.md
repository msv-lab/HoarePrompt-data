Output State: **`todo` is a set with one less element than before, specifically the element `a[j]` is removed; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split; `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set; `extra` is either a set containing `a[1]` or `a[0]`; `m` is a positive integer; `j` is 2 or 3 depending on the condition.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. Since `j` is either 2 or 3, the specific element being removed depends on the value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged.
