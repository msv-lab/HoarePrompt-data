Output State: **`todo` does not contain `a[r]`, `r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `done` now contains `a[r]` and `old` is either in `todo` and has been moved from `todo` to `done`, or `old` is in `todo` but not in `done`. If `old` is still in `extra`, then `old` is in `todo` and either in `done` but has been removed from `done`, or `old` is not in `done`. The current value of `a[r]` was in `todo` but is now removed.**

This means that the element `a[r]` has been added to the `done` set, and the variable `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) is either in `todo` and has been moved to `done`, or it is still in `todo` but not in `done`. The conditions regarding `old` being in `extra` remain unchanged.
