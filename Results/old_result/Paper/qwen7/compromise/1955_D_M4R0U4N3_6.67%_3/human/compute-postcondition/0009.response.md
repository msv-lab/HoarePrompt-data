Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split excluding `a[j]`, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, `extra` is an empty set, `m` must be a positive integer, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[0]` (since `j` is 0) to the set `done`. All other variables remain unchanged.
