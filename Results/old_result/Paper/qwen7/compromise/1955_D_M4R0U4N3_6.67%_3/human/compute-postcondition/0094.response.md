Output State: **All elements in `a` have been processed, meaning `todo` is empty and all elements originally in `todo` are now in `done`. The variable `extra` contains all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially. The variable `ans` is equal to 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now integers obtained from user input, and the list `a` is updated with integers from the input.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the existing `a` list, which was previously processed. The other variables (`todo`, `done`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values as described in the initial state.
