Postcondition: `ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 1`, and `old` is either removed from the `extra` list or added to the `todo` set. `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `a[r]` is found in the `todo` list, `old` is removed from the `extra` list, `todo` is updated to remove `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is added to the `done` list. Otherwise, `old` is added to the `extra` list.
