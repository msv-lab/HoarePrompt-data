Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the range conditions.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over a range starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` and ending at `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, with a step of 2. This means `i` starts at 1 if `x` is even, and at 2 if `x` is odd, and it increments by 2 each time until it reaches or exceeds `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 1 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 2, and `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `i`.

4. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Since `i` increments by 2 each time, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2.
   - The new value of `i` should be checked against `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` to determine if the loop continues.
   - The list `l` will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `l` remains the same.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `i + 2`.
- `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Let's calculate the new value of `i` and the condition for the next iteration:

- If `i` was 1 (if `x` is odd), the next value of `i` will be 3.
- If `i` was 2 (if `x` is even), the next value of `i` will be 4.

Since `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an input integer, `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `i`, and `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`**.
