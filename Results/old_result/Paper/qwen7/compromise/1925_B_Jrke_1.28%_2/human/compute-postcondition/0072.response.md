Postcondition: `x` is an input integer, `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`, and `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `i`, and `i` must be less than `int(x)`, and if `i <= k` is true, `ans` remains the maximum value between `ans` and `i`.
