Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, 5, and `x // 5`, `i` is 8, `x` is an integer, and `l` is a list containing `[ans, 7]` if `x % 5 == 0**.

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 7) to the list `l`. Since `i` was 7 before the append operation, after appending `i` becomes 8. The initial state of `ans` being the maximum value among `ans`, 5, and `x // 5` remains unchanged unless `x` changes. The value of `x` and its modulus condition (`x % 5 == 0`) also remain unchanged. Therefore, the list `l` now contains `[ans, 7]` if `x % 5 == 0`.
