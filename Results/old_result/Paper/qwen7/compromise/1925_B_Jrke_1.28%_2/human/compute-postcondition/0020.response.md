Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains three elements ['ans', `i`, `x // i`], where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. If `i` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains as ['ans'], where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.
