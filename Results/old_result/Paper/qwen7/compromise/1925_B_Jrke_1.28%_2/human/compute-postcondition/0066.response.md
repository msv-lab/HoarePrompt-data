Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `i` is 1 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `i`**.

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` assigns the maximum value between the current values of `ans` and `i` to `ans`. Since `l` contains `[ans, i]`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. The values of `x`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
