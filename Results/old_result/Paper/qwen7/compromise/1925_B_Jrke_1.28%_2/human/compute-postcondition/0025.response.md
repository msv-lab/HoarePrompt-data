Output State: **`l` is ['ans', `i`], `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `k` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The list `l` originally contains the element `'ans'`. After executing the line `l.append(i)`, the element `i` (which is a divisor of `x`) is appended to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
