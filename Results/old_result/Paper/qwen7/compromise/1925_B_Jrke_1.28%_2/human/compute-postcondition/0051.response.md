The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is provided, we assume the `continue` statement is inside a loop that iterates over potential divisors of `x`. The loop would typically check each divisor and update `ans` if a larger divisor is found.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an input integer
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is `x // n`
- `ans` holds the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and possibly their corresponding quotient when divided into `x`

The `continue` statement does not change the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, or `ans`. It only skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` holds the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and possibly their corresponding quotient when divided into `x`.**
