Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` consists of n integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and `e` is 0; `num` is equal to `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `arr`. No other variables are modified or assigned new values. Therefore, the values of `s`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `e`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
