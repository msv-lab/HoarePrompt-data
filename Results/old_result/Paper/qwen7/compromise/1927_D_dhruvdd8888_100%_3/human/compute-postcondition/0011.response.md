Output State: `s` is `N`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` consists of N+1 tuples where each tuple contains three elements: (1 + starting index, ending index, value at starting index), `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and `e` is 0; `num` is equal to `nums[N]`; `arr` is a list containing `-1` and N+1 tuples of the form (1 + starting index, ending index, value at starting index).
