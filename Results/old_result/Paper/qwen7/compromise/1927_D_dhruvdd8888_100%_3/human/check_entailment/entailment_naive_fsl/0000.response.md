Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no two different elements within the queried range. Specifically, the program does not check if the queried range [l, r] contains only one unique element. If all elements in the range [l, r] are the same, the program will incorrectly output a pair of indices (s-1, s) or (-1, -1) without properly indicating that no such pair exists.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
2 3
```

However, the actual output from the given program is:
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

This indicates that the program fails to correctly handle the case where all elements in the queried range are the same. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
