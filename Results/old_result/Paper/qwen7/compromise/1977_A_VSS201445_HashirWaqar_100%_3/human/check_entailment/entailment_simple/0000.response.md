Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. This part is correct.
2. **Condition Check**: For each test case, the program checks if `n` (number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (desired number of cubes) and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. 
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it means that after `n` moves, we can potentially end up with `m` cubes.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes changes with each move. Therefore, to go from `n` to `m` cubes, the difference must be even.
3. **Output**: Based on the above conditions, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. This matches the problem requirements.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
