Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Check**: 
   - The condition `if n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to potentially achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between the number of moves and the target number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each pair of moves (one put and one remove) cancels out to zero net change in the number of cubes. Therefore, the difference must be even to achieve the exact count `m`.
3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if both conditions are met, and "NO" otherwise.

Given these points, the provided solution accurately solves the problem as described.
