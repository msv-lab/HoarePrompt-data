### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - To end up with `m` cubes, the net effect of the moves must result in `m` cubes being added to the initial state (which starts with 0 cubes).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because we cannot remove more cubes than we have.
   - The difference between the total number of moves and the target number of cubes (`n - m`) must be even. This is because every addition and removal of a cube cancels out, and the difference must be balanced by an even number of such pairs to ensure the net effect is `m`.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Verification**:
   - **Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
     - `n >= m` is true.
     - `(n - m) = 0`, which is even.
     - Output: 'YES' (correct).
   - **Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
     - `n >= m` is false.
     - Output: 'NO' (correct).
   - **Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
     - `n >= m` is true.
     - `(n - m) = 2`, which is even.
     - Output: 'YES' (correct).

The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all test cases accurately. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
