Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0`. For each test case provided by the input, if the condition is met, 'YES' will be printed; otherwise, 'NO' will be printed. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop.
