Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. Since the input is expected to be a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop will execute as long as the user provides a valid input.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means that if `t` is provided as input, the loop will execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the input provided matches the condition specified. Since `t` is already defined as a positive integer within the specified range, the input should match this condition.

5. **Formulate the Final State**: The state before the loop starts should include the fact that the input provided will be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input provided must be a positive integer within the same range**.

This ensures that the loop can execute based on the given conditions.
