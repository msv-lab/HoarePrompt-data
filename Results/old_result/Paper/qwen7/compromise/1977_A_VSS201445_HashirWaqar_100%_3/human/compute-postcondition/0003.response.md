Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two positive integers n and m within the range 1 to 100, along with a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) implied through the context, and returns a value based on the relationship between n, m, and t.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `t`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and both `n` and `m` are also positive integers between 1 and 100. The function's behavior depends on the values of these parameters, but since they are not explicitly passed as arguments in the function definition, the functionality description focuses on the implied parameters and their expected ranges.
