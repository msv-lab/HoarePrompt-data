Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to generate a random rearrangement of the input string `s` using `random.sample`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated string `s2` will always be different from `s`. There is a possibility that the random sample might produce the same string `s`, especially for shorter strings.

For example, consider the input `"aaa"`:
- The program might generate `s2` as `"aaa"`, which is the same as `s`.
- In this case, the program incorrectly prints "Yes" followed by "aaa", which violates the requirement that `r` should not be equal to `s`.

To ensure that `s2` is always different from `s`, a more robust approach would be to check if `s` has more than one unique character. If it does, we can swap two characters to create a different string; otherwise, it is impossible to create a different string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(set(s)) > 1:
            # Find two different characters
            for i in range(len(s)):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(s)):
                    if s[i] != s[j]:
                        # Swap characters and form the new string
                        s2 = s[:i] + s[j] + s[i+1:j] + s[i] + s[j+1:]
                        print('Yes')
                        print(s2)
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                print('No')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This version ensures that the generated string `s2` is different from `s` if possible, thus meeting the problem description requirements.
