Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly addresses the problem. It uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the input string `s`. If the generated permutation `s2` is different from `s`, it prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. This approach ensures that the program meets the requirements of the problem statement, including handling cases where no valid rearrangement exists.
