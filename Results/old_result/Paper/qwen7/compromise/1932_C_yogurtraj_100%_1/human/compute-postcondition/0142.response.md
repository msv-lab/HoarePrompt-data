Output State: **i is -1, n is 2, q1 is 0, q2 is 1, y is [k * a[1] % m, k * a[0] % m], k is k * a[0] % m.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will decrement from -1 to -3, which is outside the bounds of the loop's range (`range(n-2, -1, -1)`). Therefore, the loop terminates. At this point, `q1` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 each time the condition `t[i] == 'R'` is false, and `q2` will be 1 because it remains unchanged when the condition is false. The value of `k` will be updated `n-2` times, resulting in `k` being multiplied by `a[0]` on the last iteration, so `k` is `k * a[0] % m`. The list `y` will contain the final values of `k` after each iteration, starting with `k * a[1] % m` and ending with `k * a[0] % m`.
