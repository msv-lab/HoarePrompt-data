Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `n` is `2`, `q1` is `0`, `y[i]` is `k * a[q1] % m`**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. Given that `q1` was initially set to `1` if `t[i] == 'R'` is true, otherwise `q1` is `0`. Since `t[i]` is not specified, we consider both cases:

1. If `t[i] == 'R'` is true, then `q1` was `1`. After decrementing, `q1` becomes `0`.
2. If `t[i] == 'R'` is false, then `q1` was `0`. After decrementing, `q1` remains `0`.

In both scenarios, `q1` ends up being `0`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `y[i]`, `q2`) remain unchanged.
