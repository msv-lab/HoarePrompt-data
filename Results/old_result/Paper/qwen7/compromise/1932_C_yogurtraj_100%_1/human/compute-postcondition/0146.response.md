Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), a list of \( n \) integers \( a \), and a string \( t \) of length \( n \) consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It then calculates a sequence of values based on the string \( t \) and the list \( a \), performing modular multiplications and updates. Finally, it prints a list of these calculated values.**
