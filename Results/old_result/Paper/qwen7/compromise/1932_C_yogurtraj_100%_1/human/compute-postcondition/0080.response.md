Output State: **`i` is `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `y[-1]` which is equal to `k`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m`, `y[i]` is equal to `k`, `q1` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decreases the value of `q1` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
