Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an input string, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated based on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q1` and `q2` are adjusted based on the last character of `t` and the number of iterations completed, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, and the element at index `i` of `y` is `k` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]; `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
