Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers split from the input string.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.
- `k` is not equal to 99999999999999.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- `k` is not equal to 1000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 199999999999999.
- `k` is not equal to 100000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 200000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 2147483648.
- Either `n` is not equal to 101 or `k` is not equal to 2147483648.
- `(n != 20 or k != 10000000000)`.
- `k` is not equal to 5999999999.
- `k` is not equal to 4294967295.
- Either `n` is not equal to 2 or `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1` or `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`.
- The current value of `k` is 3000000000.

Given this information, the print statement `print('2')` will simply print the string '2'.

Output: **2**
