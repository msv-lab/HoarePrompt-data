Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers. If `n` is 2 and `k` is 1000000000, `k` remains unchanged. If `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648, `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `n` is 20 and `k` is 10000000000, `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `k` equals 5999999999, 4294967295, or 3000000000, `k` is updated similarly. If `k` is less than the sum of all elements in `a`, `a` is modified such that the second last element is decremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` is at least 5 and is now even, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 3, `g` is 3, `a[g]` is decremented by 1, and the loop continues until both `a[d]` and `a[g]` reach 0. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
