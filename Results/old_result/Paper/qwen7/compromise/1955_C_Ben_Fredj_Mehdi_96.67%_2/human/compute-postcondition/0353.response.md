Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `n` is 101 and `k` is 100000000000, `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
