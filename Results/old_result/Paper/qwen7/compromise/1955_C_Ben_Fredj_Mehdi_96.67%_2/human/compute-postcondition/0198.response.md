Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.**

The code `g = 0` initializes the variable `g` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
