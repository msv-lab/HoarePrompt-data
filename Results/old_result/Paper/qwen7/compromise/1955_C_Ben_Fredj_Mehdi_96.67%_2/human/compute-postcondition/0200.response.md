Output State: **`a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`**.

In the given code snippet, `a[g]` is converted to an integer using `int()` and then decremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `a[g]`, the output state reflects that `a[g]` has been updated to its integer value minus one.
