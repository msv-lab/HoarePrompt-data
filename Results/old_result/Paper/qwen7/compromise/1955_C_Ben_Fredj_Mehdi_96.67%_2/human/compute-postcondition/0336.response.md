Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t > 0`: This is a condition but does not affect the list `a` directly.
   - `z = 2`: This is a constant value.
   - `a` is a list of integers where the second last element is decremented by 1 for each iteration until both `a[d]` and `a[g]` reach 0.
   - `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space. However, this value is not relevant to the final count of zeros in the list.
   - `k` is at least 5 and is now even. This is also a condition but does not affect the list `a` directly.
   - `d = len(a) - 3`: This means `d` is the index of the third last element in the list `a`.
   - `g = 3`: This is a fixed index.
   - `a[g]` is decremented by 1: Since `g = 3`, this means the fourth element in the list `a` is decremented by 1.

2. **Operations:**
   - The loop continues until both `a[d]` and `a[g]` reach 0.
   - Since `d = len(a) - 3`, the decrement operation will start from the third last element and continue until the element at index `d` becomes 0.
   - Since `g = 3`, the fourth element in the list `a` is also decremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given these conditions, let's assume the initial list `a` is such that it meets the criteria for the loop to run until both `a[d]` and `a[g]` are 0. For simplicity, let's assume the initial list `a` is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.

- Initially, `a = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.
- The loop will decrement the third last element (index 2) and the fourth element (index 3) until they reach 0.
- After one iteration, `a = [5, 5, 4, 4, 5]`.
- After two iterations, `a = [5, 5, 3, 3, 5]`.
- After three iterations, `a = [5, 5, 2, 2, 5]`.
- After four iterations, `a = [5, 5, 1, 1, 5]`.
- After five iterations, `a = [5, 5, 0, 0, 5]`.
- After six iterations, `a = [5, 5, 0, 0, 4]`.
- After seven iterations, `a = [5, 5, 0, 0, 3]`.
- After eight iterations, `a = [5, 5, 0, 0, 2]`.
- After nine iterations, `a = [5, 5, 0, 0, 1]`.
- After ten iterations, `a = [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]`.

At this point, both `a[d]` (which is `a[2]`) and `a[g]` (which is `a[3]`) are 0, so the loop stops.

Finally, the list `a` will be `[5, 5, 0, 0, 0]`.

The number of zeros in the list `a` is 2.

Output: **2**
