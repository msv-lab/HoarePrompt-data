Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it takes two positive integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and a list a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships. The function returns a result based on the given inputs for each sub-case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and process them according to the described conditions without needing any external parameters passed directly to the function.
