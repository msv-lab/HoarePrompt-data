Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the second last element has been decremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` is at least 5 and is now even, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 3, `g` is 3, `a[g]` is decremented by 1, and the loop continues until both `a[d]` and `a[g]` reach 0.**
