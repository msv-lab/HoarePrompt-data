Output: **1**

Explanation: The `print('1')` statement directly prints the string '1'. The values of other variables like `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are not relevant to this specific print statement, as it does not reference them. The statement simply outputs the string '1' regardless of the values of the other variables.
