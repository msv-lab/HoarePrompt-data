Postcondition: **The loop will continue to execute as long as `k // 2` is greater than or equal to the current value of `i`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k // 2`, `a[d]` will be decremented by the total number of iterations, and `g` will be incremented each time `a[g]` is decremented to 0. If `a[d]` reaches 0 during any iteration, `d` will be decremented accordingly. The condition `k % 2 == 1` remains true throughout the loop.**
