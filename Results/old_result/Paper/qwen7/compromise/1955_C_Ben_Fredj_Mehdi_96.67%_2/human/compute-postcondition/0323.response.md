Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with the second last element decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` must be at least 5, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 2, `g` is 3, the second last element of `a` is decremented by 1, `a[d]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. Since `g` was initially 2, after executing this line, `g` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
