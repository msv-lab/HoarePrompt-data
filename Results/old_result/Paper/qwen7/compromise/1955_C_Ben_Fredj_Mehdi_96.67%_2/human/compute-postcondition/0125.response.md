Output State: **`k` must be greater than 2 since i+1 < k//2, `g` is increased by 1, `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1`, if `a[d]` was initially equal to 0, then `g` is increased by 1, `g` is now `g + 1`, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `k` must still be greater than 2, `g` is increased by 1, `a[d]` remains `a[d] - 1`, `g` is increased by 1 if `a[d]` was initially 0, and `a[g]` is decreased by 1.
