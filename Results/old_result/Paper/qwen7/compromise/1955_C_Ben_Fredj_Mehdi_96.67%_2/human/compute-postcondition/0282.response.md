Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `z` is explicitly given as 2.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space.
- `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space.

The `print('199999')` statement simply prints the string '199999'. The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not affect this print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **199999**
