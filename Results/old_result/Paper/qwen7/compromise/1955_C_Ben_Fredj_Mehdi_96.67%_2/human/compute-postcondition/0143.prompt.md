Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`, and `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 0, and `k` is not equal to 99999999999999, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is not equal to 1000000000, `k` is not equal to 199999999999999, `k` is not equal to 100000000000, `k` is not equal to 200000000000, `k` is not equal to 2147483648, `n` is not equal to 101, either `n` is not equal to 5 or `k` is not equal to 2147483648, and `(n != 20 or k != 10000000000)`, and `k` is not equal to 5999999999, and `k` is not equal to 4294967295, and either `n` is not equal to 2 or `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1` or `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`, and `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` must be greater than 0; `a[d]` is decreased by 1. If `a[d]` is initially equal to 0, then `g` is increased by 1. If an exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block, the loop or statement is broken, and the state is unknown.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` must be greater than 2 since i+1 < k//2, `d` is decreased by 1, `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1`, if `a[d]` was initially equal to 0, then `g` is increased by 1, `g` is now `g + 1`, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 1`. If an exception occurs during the execution of the try block, the state is unknown, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` must be greater than 2, `d` is decreased by 1, `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1`, `g` is increased by 1, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 2`. If `a[g]` equals 0, then `g` is further increased by 1 and `a[g]` is set to `-2`. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the loop or block of code.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
