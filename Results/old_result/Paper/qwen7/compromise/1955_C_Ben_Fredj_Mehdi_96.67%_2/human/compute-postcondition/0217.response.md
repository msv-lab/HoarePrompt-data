Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `k` must be `k // 2` or greater, `g` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged in terms of their conditions; `i` is updated to `i_prev + 2` due to the initial state where `i` was `i_prev + 1`, and `k` must still be `k // 2` or greater.
