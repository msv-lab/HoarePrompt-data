Output State: **`k` must be greater than 2, `d` is decreased by 1, `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1`, `g` is increased by 1, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `d -= 1` decrements the value of `d` by 1. The other conditions and assignments related to `a[d]`, `g`, and `a[g]` remain unchanged from the initial postconditions. Therefore, the updated state includes `d` being decreased by 1, while the other conditions about `a[d]`, `g`, and `a[g]` stay the same.
