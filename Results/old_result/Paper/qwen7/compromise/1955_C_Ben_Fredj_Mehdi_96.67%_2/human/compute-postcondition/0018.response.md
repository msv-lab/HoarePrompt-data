Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers split from an input string.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.
- `k` is equal to 99999999999.

The print statement is `print('99')`.

This statement directly prints the string `'99'` without involving any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **99**
