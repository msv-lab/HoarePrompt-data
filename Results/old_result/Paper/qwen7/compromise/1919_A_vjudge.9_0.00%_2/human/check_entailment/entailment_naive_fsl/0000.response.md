Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not account for the sequence of moves and the ability to swap wallets during each turn. Instead, they simply determine the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. This approach is incorrect because it does not reflect the optimal strategy for the game.

For example, consider the test case where \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\):

- According to the rules, Alice starts and has the option to either swap wallets or remove a coin from her own wallet.
- If Alice removes a coin, she will have 0 coins, and Bob will then be forced to remove a coin from his wallet, leaving him with 0 coins as well.
- Neither player can make a move after this, so the game ends in a draw, but the provided function incorrectly returns "Bob" as the winner.

Similarly, other test cases like \(a = 1\) and \(b = 4\) or \(a = 5\) and \(b = 3\) do not follow the correct logic of the game, leading to incorrect outcomes. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
