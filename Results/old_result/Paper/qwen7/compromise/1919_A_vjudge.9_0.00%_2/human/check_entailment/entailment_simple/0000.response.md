### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their own wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.

2. **Analyzing the `func_1` Function:**
   - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

3. **Analyzing the `func_2` Function:**
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Game Outcome Based on Parity:**
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.

5. **Verification of the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly implements the logic described above.
   - The `func_1` function accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results as expected.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the game logic and outputs the correct results based on the given problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
