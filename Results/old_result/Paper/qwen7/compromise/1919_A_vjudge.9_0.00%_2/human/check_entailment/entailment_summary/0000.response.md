Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- The provided solution uses a single function `func_1` to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the initial number of coins.
- `func_1` works correctly by checking if the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even or odd:
  - If the sum is even, `func_1` returns 'Bob'.
  - If the sum is odd, `func_1` returns 'Alice'.
- The `func_2` function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the given values of `a` and `b`.
- Based on the provided examples and the logic of the game, the game's outcome is determined by the parity of the sum of the initial number of coins:
  - If the sum is even, Bob wins because he can always force the game into a state where the sum remains even after his turn.
  - If the sum is odd, Alice wins because she can always force the game into a state where the sum becomes even after her turn.
- The execution summary of `func_2` matches the expected behavior: it correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the correct result based on the parity check performed by `func_1`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
