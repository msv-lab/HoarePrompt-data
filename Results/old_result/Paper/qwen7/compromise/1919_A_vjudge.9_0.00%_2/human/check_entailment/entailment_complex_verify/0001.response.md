### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., a wallet with zero or fewer coins) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Strategy**:
   - If both players play optimally, the key observation is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. For example, if Alice removes a coin from her wallet, Bob can remove a coin from his wallet, ensuring that the sum remains even until the end. This strategy ensures Bob wins.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, Alice can always ensure that the sum becomes even after her move, forcing Bob into a losing position. This strategy ensures Alice wins.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', indicating Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice', indicating Alice wins.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

However, there is a critical flaw in the reasoning provided in the original assessment. The original assessment assumes that the game can be decided solely based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. This assumption is incorrect because the game involves the sequence of moves and the ability to force the opponent into a losing position.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - For each test case, the program reads the values of `a` and `b`.
  - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - The result is stored in the `results` list.
- **Output**:
  - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - The game involves a sequence of moves where each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - The optimal strategy depends on the sequence of moves, not just the parity of the sum.
   - For example, if Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 1 coin, the sum is even, but Alice can force Bob to lose by swapping wallets and then removing her coin, leaving Bob with no valid move.

2. **Example from the Problem Description**:
   - In the first test case, the sum is even (0 + 1 = 1), but Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position by not swapping and then removing her coin.
   - In the second test case, the sum is odd (3 + 1 = 4), but Alice can force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing her coin.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is incorrect because it does not account for the sequence of moves and the ability to force the opponent into a losing position. The provided functions do not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
