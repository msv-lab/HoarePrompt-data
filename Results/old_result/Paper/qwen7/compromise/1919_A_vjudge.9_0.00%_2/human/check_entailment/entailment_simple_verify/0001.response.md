### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., a wallet with zero or fewer coins) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Strategy**:
   - The key observation is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. For example, if Alice removes a coin from her wallet, Bob can remove a coin from his wallet, ensuring that the sum remains even until the end. This strategy ensures Bob wins.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, Alice can always ensure that the sum becomes even after her move, forcing Bob into a losing position. This strategy ensures Alice wins.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', indicating Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice', indicating Alice wins.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - The logic is sound and aligns with the strategy described above.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
  - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - The results are stored in a list and printed out.

### Verification Against the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**:
  - `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function returns 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
  - The function returns 'Alice' if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases.
  - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and stores the results.
  - It prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. The annotated code accurately reflects the behavior of the functions and the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
