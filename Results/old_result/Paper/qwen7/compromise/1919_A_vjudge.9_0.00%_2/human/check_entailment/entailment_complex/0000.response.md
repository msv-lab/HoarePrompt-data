### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The game rules are such that players take turns, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function correctly checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
     - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - This logic aligns with the game's rules because if the sum of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves until the first player is forced into a losing position. Conversely, if the sum is odd, the first player (Alice) can force the second player into a losing position.
   
   - **Function `func_2()`**:
     - This function correctly processes multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b`.
     - For each pair `(a, b)`, it calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
     - It collects the results in a list and then prints each result.
     - The function does not modify the input integer `t` and ensures that the output is consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions work together to correctly implement the game logic.
   - `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem description and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
Given that both functions together correctly implement the game logic and produce the expected outputs based on the problem description, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
