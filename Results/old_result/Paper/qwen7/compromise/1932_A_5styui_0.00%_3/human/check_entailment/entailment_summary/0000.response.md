Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum number of coins ('@') that can be collected while moving from the leftmost cell to the right, with the constraint that you cannot move to a cell with thorns ('*').
- The provided code simply counts the number of '@' characters in each string without considering the movement constraints.
- The code does not account for the fact that you can move one or two cells at a time and must avoid cells with thorns.
- The code also incorrectly handles the breaking condition for consecutive thorns ('*'). Specifically, the `if b[:]:` check is always true because `b[:]` is just a copy of the list `b`, and the subsequent checks for consecutive thorns are flawed.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
