Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `s` is 0, `i` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes, and `d` and `a` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `s = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. This overwrites the previous value of `s`, which was the count of '@' characters in `b`. All other variables (`b`, `i`, `d`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
