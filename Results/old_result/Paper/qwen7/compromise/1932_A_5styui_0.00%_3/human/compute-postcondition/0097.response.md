Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the iterator variable. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`**: According to the given state before the loop starts, `j` is initially set to `len(input string)`.

3. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(len(b))`. This means `j` will take values from `0` to `len(b) - 1`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range `0` to `len(b) - 1`. Given that `j` starts at `len(input string)`, we need to ensure that `len(input string)` is less than or equal to `len(b)`.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `j` is within the valid range for the loop to execute. Since `j` starts at `len(input string)` and the loop will run until `j` reaches `len(b)`, we need to ensure that `len(input string)` is less than or equal to `len(b)`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` being less than or equal to `len(b)`.

**Final State:**
State: **`j` is less than or equal to `len(b)`, `b` is an input string, `s` is 0, `i` is `i_final + len(input string) + 1`, `d` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged**
