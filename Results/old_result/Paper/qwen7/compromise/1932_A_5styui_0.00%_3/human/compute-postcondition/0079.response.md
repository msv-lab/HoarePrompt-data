Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial State at the Start of the Loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j_final + 1`. This means that the loop has already processed up to `j_final`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of `len(b)`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(b)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `j_final + 1`, the next value of `j` would be `j_final + 2`.
   - The variables `b`, `s`, `i`, `d`, and `a` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will be `j_final + 2`.
   - `b`, `s`, `i`, `d`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`b`, `s`, `i`, `d`, and `a` remain unchanged, `j` is now `j_final + 2`**
