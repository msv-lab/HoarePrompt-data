Output State: **`s` is `s + 1`, `b` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `j` is now `j_final + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. All other variables (`b`, `i`, `d`, `a`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
