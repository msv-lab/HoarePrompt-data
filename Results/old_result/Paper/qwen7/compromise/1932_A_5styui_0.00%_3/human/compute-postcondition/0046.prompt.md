Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` is a non-empty string. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', the integer `s` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `j` is neither '*' nor '@', and the character at index `j + 1` is '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` is a non-empty string, `s` is an integer, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `b[j]` is equal to '@', we proceed as per the if part. If `b[j + 1]` is equal to '*', either from the if part or the else part (though there is no else part here), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[j + 1]` is not '*', no further changes are made to `b`, `s`, or `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` is a non-empty string, `s` is an integer, and `j` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', the function continues with the next step where `j` remains as `j + 1`. If the character at index `j` in `b` is either empty or '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `j` remains as `j + 1` and no other changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
