Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `b` is a non-empty string.
- `s` is an integer.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- If `b[j]` is equal to '@', we proceed as per the if part.
- If `b[j + 1]` is equal to '*', either from the if part or the else part (though there is no else part here), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `b[j + 1]` is not '*', no further changes are made to `b`, `s`, or `j`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(b)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `s` is an integer.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for each index `j` in the range from `0` to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know the conditions under which it might break or continue based on the values of `b[j]` and `b[j + 1]`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The values of `b` and `s` should remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(b) - 1` (since `j` starts from `0` and goes up to `len(b) - 2`).

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one.
- After incrementing `j` by 1, `j` becomes `j + 1`.
- `b` and `s` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

### Final State:
- `b` is a non-empty string.
- `s` is an integer.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `j + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `s` is an integer, `j` is incremented by 1 to become `j + 1`**.
