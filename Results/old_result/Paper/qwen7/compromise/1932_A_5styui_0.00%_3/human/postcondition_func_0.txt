The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a string of length \( n \) containing '.', '@', and '*'. It counts the number of '@' characters in each string and prints this count for each test case. If the function encounters two consecutive '*' characters in any string, it breaks out of the loop for that string. The function does not return any value but prints the count of '@' characters for each test case.
