Output State: `n` is 0, `s` is the sum of the results from all iterations of the loop, and we have processed `t` test cases.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be 0 because the loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of the results (`res`) from each iteration of the loop. Since the loop processes each test case completely before moving on to the next, and we started with processing `t-1` test cases, after all iterations, we would have processed `t` test cases.
