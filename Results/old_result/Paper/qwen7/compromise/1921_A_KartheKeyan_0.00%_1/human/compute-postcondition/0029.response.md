Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. Since the initial value of `i` is 4 and no changes were made to it within the given code snippet, `i` remains 4. The values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the user's input, hence they are described as integers from the input.
