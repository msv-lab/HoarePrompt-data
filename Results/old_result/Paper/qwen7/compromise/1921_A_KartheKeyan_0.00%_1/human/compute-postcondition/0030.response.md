Output State: **`i` is 4; `x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer from input; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**.

The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are integers obtained from input, `coord` now contains one tuple with these values. The values of `i` and the nature of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
