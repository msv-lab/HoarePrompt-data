Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an input integer from the second split value; `y` is an input integer from the second split value; `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (1, y), (x, y)**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(1, y)`. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains two tuples: `(1, y)` and `(x, y)`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
