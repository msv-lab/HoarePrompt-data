Output State: `i` is 4, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `coord` is a list containing three tuples. The first tuple is (4, an integer from input), the second tuple is (an integer from input, an integer from input), and the third tuple is (another integer from input, another integer from input).

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (4 times), the variable `i` will be 4, and the variable `x` will hold the last integer input during the third iteration of the loop, while `y` will hold the integer input during the fourth iteration. The list `coord` will contain three tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` input from the user during each iteration of the loop.
