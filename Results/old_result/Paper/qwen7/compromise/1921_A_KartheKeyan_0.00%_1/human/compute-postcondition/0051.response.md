Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `coord` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(x, y)` from the input, and the second tuple is also `(x, y)`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an integer from the input split.
   - `y` is an integer from the input split.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(4)`, meaning `i` can take values from 0 to 3.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `i`.
   - No other variables (`coord`, `x`, or `y`) are directly modified within the loop head.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `coord`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`coord` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (x, y) from the input, and the second tuple is also (x, y); `i` is 1; `x` is an integer from the input split; `y` is an integer from the input split**.
