Output State: **`coord` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (x, y) from the input, the second tuple is also (x, y), and the third tuple is (x, y); `i` is 1; `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split; `y` is updated to the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are already updated to the first and second integers from the input split respectively, and the first two tuples in `coord` are already `(x, y)`, the third tuple in `coord` will also be `(x, y)`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
