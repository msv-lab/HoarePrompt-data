Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split value, `y` is an input integer from the third split value, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`), (2, `y`), (3, `y`)), `p2` is 1, `res` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `p2` is given as \((3 - 2)^2 + (y - y)^2\), which simplifies to \(1^2 + 0^2 = 1\).
- The code then calculates `res` as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`. However, since `p1` is not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet, we assume it is a typo or not used in the calculation. Given the context, we consider only the provided `p2` value.
- Since `p2` is 1, `math.sqrt(p2)` is `sqrt(1)`, which is 1.
- Therefore, `res` is `abs(1 * 1)`, which is 1.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
