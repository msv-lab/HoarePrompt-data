Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`)).**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them based on a space. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 2. The `coord` list is updated to contain two tuples: (1, y) and (x, y).
