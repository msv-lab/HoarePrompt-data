Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each test case, and we have processed `t-1` test cases.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))
    print(res)
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split value, `y` is an input integer from the third split value, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`), (2, `y`), (3, `y`)), `p2` is 1, `res` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 4, `x` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `y` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `coord` is a list of three tuples sorted by the first element of each tuple, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the fourth and third tuple in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `n` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `coord` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (x, y), the second tuple is (x, y), and the third tuple is (x, y); `i` is 2; `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first points in `coord`; `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third points in `coord`; `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
