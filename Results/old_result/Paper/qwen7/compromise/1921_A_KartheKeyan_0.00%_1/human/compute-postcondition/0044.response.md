Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `y` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the fourth and third tuple in `coord`, `n` must be at least 1**

The code `res = 0` sets the variable `res` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
