Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(4)`. This means the loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to 3.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 0.

3. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`res`, `n`, `s`, and `coord`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **Summarize the required adjustments**: We only need to ensure that `i` is 0 when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0**
