Output State: **`i` is 4; `x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer from input; `coord` is a list containing two tuples, the first one is (4, `x`), the second one is (`x`, `y`).**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(4, `x`)`. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains two tuples: the first one is `(4, `x`)` and the second one is `(x, `y`). The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
