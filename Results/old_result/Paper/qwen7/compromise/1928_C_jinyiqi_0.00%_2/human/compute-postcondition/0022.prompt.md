You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and n are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is greater than or equal to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` from 1 up to the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\), `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients when `x` is divided by each divisor in `output1`.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines the quotients when `x` is divided by each of its divisors from the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) down to 1, followed by the divisors themselves.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer. It returns a list containing the quotients of `x` divided by each of its divisors from the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) down to 1, followed by the divisors themselves.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list that combines the quotients when `x` is divided by each of its divisors from the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) down to 1, followed by the divisors themselves.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
