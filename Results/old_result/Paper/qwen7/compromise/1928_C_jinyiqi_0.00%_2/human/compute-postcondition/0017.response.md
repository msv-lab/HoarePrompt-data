Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 5, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1, 3, and 5, `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x / 2`, the integer value of `x / 3`, and the integer value of `x / 5`. If `x` is divisible by 5, `output1` includes 5 and `output2` includes the integer value of `x / 5`. Otherwise, `output1` remains as [1, 3] and `output2` remains as [x / 2, x / 3].
