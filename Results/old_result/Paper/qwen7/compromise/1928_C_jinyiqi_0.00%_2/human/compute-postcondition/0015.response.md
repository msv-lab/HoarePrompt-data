Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 5, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1, 3, and 5, `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x / 2`, the integer value of `x / 3`, and the integer value of `x / 5`.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `x / i` (where `i` is 5) to the list `output2`. Since `x` is an integer and `i` is 5, `x / 5` is appended to `output2`. The other variables and their lists remain unchanged. Therefore, `output2` now contains the integer values of `x / 2`, `x / 3`, and `x / 5`.
