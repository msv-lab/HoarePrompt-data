Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit the settling pattern described.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions within each cycle of \( 2k - 2 \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the possible values of \( k \) using the conditions provided in the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \), which helps in determining the possible values of \( k \).

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even because \( 2k - 2 \) must be even.
   - It uses the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) to find valid \( k \) values where \( \frac{s + 2}{2} \geq x \).
   - The results are stored in a set to avoid duplicates and then converted to a list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even, ensuring that the divisors are correctly processed.
   - The logic for finding valid \( k \) values is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.
   - The provided execution summary matches the expected behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
