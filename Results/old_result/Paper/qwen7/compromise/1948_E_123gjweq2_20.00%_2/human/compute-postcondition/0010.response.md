The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. Both `left` and `right` are integers with the constraint that `left < right`, and `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier. The function does not explicitly return any value based on the given information, but rather constructs an array or performs some operation within its body.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `left` and `right` where `left < right`, and an integer `clique`. It constructs an array or performs operations based on these parameters.**
