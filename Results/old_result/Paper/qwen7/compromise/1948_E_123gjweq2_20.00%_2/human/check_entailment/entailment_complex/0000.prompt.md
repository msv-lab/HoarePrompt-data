Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 40, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` with values according to the specified range and clique assignment.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cliques` is equal to ceil(`n` / `k`), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 40, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n, `arr` is a list of length `n` with some elements set to non-zero values depending on the values of `cliques`, `i * k`, and min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `cliques` times. During each iteration `i`, it sets elements in `arr` from index `i * k` to min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1) to a value of `i + 1`. This means that for each `i`, a segment of `arr` starting at `i * k` and ending at the minimum of (i + 1) * k - 1 or n - 1 will be filled with the value `i + 1`. The rest of the array remains zero. The variable `cliquess` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 (or a similar pattern based on the specific values of `n` and `k`)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is an integer between 1 and n inclusive)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (n zeros)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 40` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) as `ceil(n / k)`. The function then fills an array `arr` of length `n` with values based on the calculated number of cliques and the range defined by `k`. Specifically, for each clique `i`, it sets elements in `arr` from index `i * k` to the minimum of `(i + 1) * k - 1` and `n - 1` to the value `i + 1`. After filling the array, the function prints the array, the number of cliques, and an array of `n` zeros.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that left < right, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `small_element + i` for `i` in the range `0` to `mid - 1` and corresponding `cliquess` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `clique`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `small_element + i` for `i` in the range `0` to `mid - 1` and elements from index `left + mid` to `left + not_mid - 1` are set to `big_element - (i - mid)` and corresponding `cliquess` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `clique` and elements from index `left + mid` to `left + not_mid - 1` are set to `clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts two integers `left` and `right` (where `left < right`) and an integer `clique`. It constructs an array `arr` and another list `cliquess`. The function sets the elements of `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` to values starting from `small_element` (which is `left + 1`) and incrementing by 1, and sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to `clique`. It then sets the elements of `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + not_mid - 1` to values starting from `big_element` (which is `right + 1`) and decrementing by 1, and sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to `clique`. After the function executes, the array `arr` and list `cliquess` are updated according to these rules.
