Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in each test case string. Here's a breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to zero.
3. It then iterates through each character in the string, incrementing the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B').
4. After counting the characters in the current test case, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'.
5. Based on the comparison, it prints 'A' or 'B' accordingly.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program correctly follows the steps required to solve the problem. It handles multiple test cases as specified and produces the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
