You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in the original string `s`, `bc` is the total count of non-'A' characters in the original string `s`, `s` is an empty string, and `i` is no longer applicable since `s` is now empty.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the range of 1 to 32, `q` is set to `t-1`, `ac` contains the total number of 'A' characters found in the original string `s`, `bc` contains the total number of non-'A' characters found in the original string `s`, the string `s` has been fully processed and is now an empty string, and the variable `i` is no longer defined as it refers to the last character of `s`, which is now non-existent.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is set to `t-1`, `ac` contains the total number of 'A' characters found in the original string `s`, `bc` contains the total number of non-'A' characters found in the original string `s`, the string `s` is now an empty string, and `ac` is either greater than `bc` or less than or equal to `bc` depending on the condition of the if statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 32 test cases, where each test case involves an input string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the number of 'A' characters (`ac`) and the number of non-'A' characters (`bc`). After processing all test cases, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of non-'A' characters, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but outputs 'A' or 'B' based on the comparison of counts.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all possible cases correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5 and the characters are either 'A' or 'B', the program will always produce the correct result. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the problem description.
