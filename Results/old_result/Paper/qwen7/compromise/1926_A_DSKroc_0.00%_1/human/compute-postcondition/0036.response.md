Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is 1, `bc` is either 1 or 0, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the first character of `s`**.

Explanation: The value of `ac` is incremented by 1. Since `ac` was initially either 0 or 1 (based on its definition as `ac` being either 1 or 0), after the increment, `ac` becomes 1. The values of `t`, `q`, `bc`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
