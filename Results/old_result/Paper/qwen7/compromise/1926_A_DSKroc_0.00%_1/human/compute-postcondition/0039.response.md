Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 32.
   - `q` is `t-1`.
   - `ac` is either 1 or 0.
   - `bc` is either 1 or 2.
   - `s` is a non-empty input string.
   - `i` is the first character of `s`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. Since `i` is set to the first character of `s` at the start of the loop, the loop will continue until all characters in `s` have been processed.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After processing the first character, `i` will be the second character of `s`.
   - The string `s` will now be the original string minus the first character.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `q` remains unchanged because it is derived from `t` and not directly affected by the loop.
   - `ac` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `bc` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `s` becomes the original string minus the first character.
   - `i` becomes the second character of the original string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is either 1 or 2, `s` is the original string minus the first character, `i` is the second character of the original string**.
