Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is either 1 or 0, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the first character of `s`. If the first character `i` of the string `s` is 'A', then `ac` is set to 1 and `bc` remains 0. Otherwise, `ac` remains 0 and `bc` is set to 1.
