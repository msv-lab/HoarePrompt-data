Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `char`.
   - `i` is the index of the current character in the string `s`.
   - `char` is the current character from the string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `s` is an input string of a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - `balance` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the loop head).
   - `details` is an empty list (though this variable is not used in the loop head).

3. **Adjust the states of the variables in the loop head**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being 0 (the first character of the string), `i` should be set to 0.
   - The first character of the string `s` should be assigned to `char`.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. Therefore, `s` must be a non-empty string.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `char` should be the first character of the string `s`.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`i` is 0, `char` is the first character of the string `s`, `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")"**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `char` is the first character of the string `s`, `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")"**.
