Output State: **t is 3, i is 2, N is greater than 0, and cnt dictionary contains the count of each integer present in the list a after all iterations of the loop.**

Explanation: Based on the given conditions, the loop continues to increment `i` and check the conditions until `t` reaches 3. Since the loop executes up to the third iteration, it implies that `t` has been incremented to 3 by the end of the loop. At this point, `i` would be 2 because the loop increments `i` from 0 to 2. The value of `N` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue iterating. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each integer present in the list `a` after all iterations of the loop, as specified in the initial state.
