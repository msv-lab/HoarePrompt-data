Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state.
   - `N` is not specified in the given state.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < N`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is not initialized, we need to set `i` to 0 (the starting point of the loop).
   - We need to ensure that `N` is a positive integer, otherwise the loop will not execute.

Given the above points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start executing. Therefore, we need to set `i` to 0 and ensure that `N` is greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, `N` must be greater than 0**
