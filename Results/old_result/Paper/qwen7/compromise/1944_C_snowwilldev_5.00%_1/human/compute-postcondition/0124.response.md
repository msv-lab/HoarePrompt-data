Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each integer is within the range [0, n-1]. For each test case, the function returns information about the array `a`.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not specified in the given information, so the description focuses on the input structure and constraints.
