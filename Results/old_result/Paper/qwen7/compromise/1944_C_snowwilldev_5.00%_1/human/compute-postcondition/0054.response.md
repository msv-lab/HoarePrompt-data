Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially equal to `N`.
   - `N` is a constant, so its value is fixed but unknown.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `N`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `N` at the start of the loop.
   - Since `i` is initially equal to `N`, the condition `i < N` is false at the start of the loop, meaning the loop will not execute even once.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `N` at the start of the loop.
   - We need to set `i` to a value less than `N`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `N`. Specifically, `i` should be set to a value less than `N` to allow the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 0, `i` is less than `N`, `tc` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each value is incremented based on the count of each element in the list `a` up to index `N-1`**
