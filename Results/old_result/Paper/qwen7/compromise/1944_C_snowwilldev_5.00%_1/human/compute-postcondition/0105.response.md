Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `i` is 0
   - `N` is greater than 0
   - Either `t` is incremented to 2 or remains 1, `i` remains 0, and `N` remains greater than 0, or `cnt[i]` is set to 0 and the loop or statement is broken.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(N):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0, the condition `i < N` will be true as long as `N > 0`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is 0 and `N` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again if `N` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 1.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` remains 1 (since it was not incremented to 2 in the previous iteration)
   - `i` becomes 1
   - `N` remains greater than 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 1, and `N` is greater than 0**
