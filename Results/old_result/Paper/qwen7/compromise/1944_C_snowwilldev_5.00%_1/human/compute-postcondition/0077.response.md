Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `tc` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `i`, and `tc`. It only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no new values are assigned and the condition about `cnt[i]` remains unchanged, the values stay the same.
