Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(N):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `N`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < N`.
3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1 from its value in the previous iteration. Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, the current value of `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
4. **Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`. Since `i` is currently `i_prev + 1`, the condition for the next iteration is `i_prev + 1 < N`.

### Adjusting the State
- **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` needs to be updated to `i_prev + 1`.
- **Variable `N`**: The value of `N` remains unchanged.

### Final State
Since the only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N`, and `N` does not change, we only need to update `i` to reflect the next iteration.

**State:**
- `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 (this state remains the same as it is not part of the loop head)
- `i` is updated to `i_prev + 1`
- `N` remains unchanged

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i_prev` was some value `k`. Therefore, `i` is now `k + 1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `N` must be greater than `k + 1`**
