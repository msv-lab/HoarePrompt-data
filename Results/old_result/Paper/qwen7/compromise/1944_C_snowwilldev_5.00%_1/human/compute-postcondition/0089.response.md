Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < N`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `N` remains unchanged.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
   - The variable `N` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `cnt[a[i]]` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it does not affect the loop head variables directly.
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we need to update these.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `N` must be the same as before**.

However, since the exact value of `i_prev` is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `N` must be the same as before**.

Given that `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can simplify it to:

State: **`cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `N` must be the same as before**.

Since `i_prev` is not explicitly given, we can represent it as `i + 1` if `i` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Final Answer:
State: **`cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `N` must be the same as before**.
