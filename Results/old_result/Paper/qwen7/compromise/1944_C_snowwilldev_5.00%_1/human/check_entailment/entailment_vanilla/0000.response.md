Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and computes the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Determining MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the range `[0, N)` and checks the count of each index `i` in the array.
   - If the count of `i` is exactly 1, it increments `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or the count of `i` becomes 0, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves two types of moves: Alice can pick any element from `a`, append it to `c`, and remove it from `a`. Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it.
   - The program does not simulate these moves; instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each index in the array `a`.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the MEX by checking the count of indices in the array `a` rather than constructing the array `c` based on the moves made by Alice and Bob.
   - The MEX should be calculated based on the final state of `c`, not the intermediate states of `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current logic does not reflect this strategic interaction.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic or compute the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
