You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

    t = int(input())

            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: Output State: The total cost calculated for each test case based on the given conditions, printed for each iteration of the loop. If the usual price of a bun (a) is greater than or equal to the modified price of the first bun (b), the total cost is simply the usual price multiplied by the number of buns (n). Otherwise, the total cost is calculated using the formula involving the modified price, the difference between the usual and modified prices, and the number of buns.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where `k` should be set to `n` if `b - a + 1` is greater than `n`. This means that if the price difference between the usual price and the modified price is large enough to allow selling all buns at the modified price, the program does not account for this possibility.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10 1 10
```
The program should calculate the maximum profit by selling all 10 buns at the modified price of 10 coins each, resulting in a total profit of 100 coins. However, the current implementation checks if `a >= b` and prints `n * a`, which would incorrectly give a profit of 10 coins instead of 100 coins.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that `k` is set to `n` if `b - a + 1` is greater than `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            if k < n:
                ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
                p2 = (n - k) * a
                print(ans + p2)
            else:
                print(n * b)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum possible profit is calculated correctly for all cases.
