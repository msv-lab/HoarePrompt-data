### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit Bob can make by selling \( n \) buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is \( a \) coins.
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price, which is \( b - i + 1 \) coins for the \( i \)-th bun.
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It checks if \( a \ge b \). If true, it prints \( n \times a \) because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - Otherwise, it calculates \( k \) as \( \min(b - a + 1, n) \).
     - This ensures \( k \) is within the valid range.
   - It calculates the profit from the first \( k \) buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 
     \[
     \text{Profit from first } k \text{ buns} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1))
     \]
   - It calculates the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - Finally, it adds these two profits and prints the result.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating the profit from the first \( k \) buns is correct. The formula used is indeed the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - The condition \( a \ge b \) correctly handles the scenario where selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - The calculation of \( k \) and the subsequent profit calculation are logically sound.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( a \ge b \), the solution correctly prints \( n \times a \).
   - When \( a < b \), the solution correctly calculates the profit by choosing the optimal \( k \) and splitting the buns accordingly.
   - The use of `min(b - a + 1, n)` ensures that \( k \) does not exceed the number of buns available or the range defined by \( b \).

5. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula for the sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic series starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 each time is correct:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1)) = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1)
     \]

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions. The solution handles all edge cases and uses the correct formulas.
