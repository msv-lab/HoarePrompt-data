Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. For each test case, it calculates the total cost of selling \( n \) buns, considering the modified price for the first bun and the usual price for the rest. If the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the modified price \( b \), the total cost is simply \( n \times a \). Otherwise, it uses a specific formula to compute the total cost, taking into account the modified price, the difference between the usual and modified prices, and the number of buns. The function prints the total cost for each test case.**
