Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `k - dic[l[i-1]]`, `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements of list `o` and values are their counts in list `o`, `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in reverse order. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
