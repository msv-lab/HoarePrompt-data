The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in the string `a` split by spaces into integers; `o` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `k` is the third element of the list `b`; the condition `k == n` is true.**
