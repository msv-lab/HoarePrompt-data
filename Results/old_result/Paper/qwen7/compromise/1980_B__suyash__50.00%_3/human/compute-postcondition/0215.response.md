Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `a` of length `n`, and two additional integers `f` and `k`. It then checks if it's possible to remove up to `k` elements from the list such that the `f`-th element remains in the list. Based on the conditions met, it prints either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE'. If none of the conditions are met, it prints nothing. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything but prints the results directly.**
