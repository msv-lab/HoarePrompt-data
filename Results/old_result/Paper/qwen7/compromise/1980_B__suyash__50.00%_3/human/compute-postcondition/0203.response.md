Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]`, `fav` is not equal to `l[i_end + 1]`**

Explanation: The code `k -= dic[l[i]]` decreases the value of `k` by the value of `dic[l[i_end + 1]]`. The value of `i` remains `i_end + 1` and `fav` remains not equal to `l[i_end + 1]`.
