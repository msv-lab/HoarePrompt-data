Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is `k - dic[l[2]]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `k`. The expression `k - dic[l[2]]` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the implied loop or conditional block.
