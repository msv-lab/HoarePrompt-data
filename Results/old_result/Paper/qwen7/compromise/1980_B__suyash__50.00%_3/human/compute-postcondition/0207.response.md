Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]`, `fav` is not equal to `l[i_end + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `i`, `k`, or `fav`. It simply exits the loop or conditional block, indicating that the execution moves to the next line of code outside of the loop or conditional.
