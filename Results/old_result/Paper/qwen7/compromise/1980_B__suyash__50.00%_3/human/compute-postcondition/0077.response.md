Output State: **`i` is equal to `t`, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split()**.

Explanation: The code `o = input().split()` takes input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to `o`. The initial values of `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new variable `o` is created and assigned the result of the split operation on the input.
