Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The program sorts the array and prints the difference between the last and first elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
3
10 5 15
```

The program would sort the array to `[5, 10, 15]` and output `15 - 5 = 10`. However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[15, 5, 10]`, resulting in a beauty of `(15 - 5) + (5 - 10) = 10 - 5 = 5`.

To correctly solve this problem, Sasha needs to rearrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. One approach is to sort the array and then pair the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            max_beauty += a[n - 1 - i] - a[i]
        if n % 2 != 0:
            max_beauty += a[n // 2]
        print(max_beauty)


func()
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum beauty by pairing the smallest and largest elements appropriately.
