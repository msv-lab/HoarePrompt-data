Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the conditions for a 'STAIR' and a 'PEAK'.
2. The program iterates over each test case and processes the input values \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) as required.
3. The logic for determining whether the sequence forms a 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' is accurate according to the problem statement.
4. The program prints the appropriate label for each test case without returning any value, which matches the expected behavior from the execution summary.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
