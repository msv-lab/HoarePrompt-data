### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases where the digits might not form a stair or a peak correctly. For example, if `a >= b` or `b <= c`, it will print 'NONE'.

Given that the conditions are checked correctly and all possible scenarios are covered, the program should work as expected based on the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct according to the problem description.
