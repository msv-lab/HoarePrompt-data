Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the problem description. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three digits and checks the conditions for a stair and a peak. The program outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" accordingly, which matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement.
