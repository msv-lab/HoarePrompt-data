You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `q` lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions evaluated for each set of inputs (a, b, c) provided in the loop. Each line corresponds to the output of one iteration of the loop, where `i` ranges from 0 to `q-1`. The initial values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged, but `t` is not used within the loop, so its value does not affect the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9. For each test case, it determines whether the sequence \(a, b, c\) represents a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b > c\)), or neither ('NONE'). It outputs one of these labels for each test case. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description. For each test case, the program checks if the digits satisfy the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`). If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The logic in the program accurately implements the described behavior for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
