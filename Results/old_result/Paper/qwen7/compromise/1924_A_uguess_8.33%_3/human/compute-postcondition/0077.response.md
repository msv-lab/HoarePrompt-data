Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `cnt` is 1
- `cur` is 0
- The postcondition states that if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then there is no change to `cnt` and `cur`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for ss in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `ss` is iterating over the elements of the list `s`.
- There are no explicit changes to `cnt` or `cur` within the loop body (as indicated by "the loop body is omitted").
- The condition for changing `cnt` and `cur` is based on the value of `cur` being equal to `(1 << k) - 1`.

### State Adjustment
- Since there are no explicit changes to `cnt` or `cur` within the loop body, their values remain the same at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `s`.

### New State
Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, the values of `cnt` and `cur` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0**
