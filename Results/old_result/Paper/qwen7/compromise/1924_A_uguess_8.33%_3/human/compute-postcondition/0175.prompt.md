Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tmp` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. `cnt`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `cur_ss` retain their initial or final states as given.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tmp` is 'a', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, `i` is 1, and the current value of `cur` satisfies `cur & 1 << i == 0`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `tmp` will be set to 'a', `cnt` will remain unchanged as it represents the count of valid substrings, `cur` will be reset to 0, `ans` will consist of `cnt` characters each being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` will retain its original value, and `i` will be set to 1 with the condition that `cur & 1 << i == 0` is satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` is 'c', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, and `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` is either 'c' or 'e', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, and `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
