Output State: **`tmp` is 'e', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, and `i` is `k`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `tmp` will be set to 'e' (since the loop iterates from `i=0` to `i=k-1`, and the last value `i` can take is `k-1`, which corresponds to 'e' in the sequence 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'), `cnt` will still represent the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` will be reset to 0, `ans` will consist of `cnt` characters each being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` will retain its initial state, and `i` will be equal to `k`.
