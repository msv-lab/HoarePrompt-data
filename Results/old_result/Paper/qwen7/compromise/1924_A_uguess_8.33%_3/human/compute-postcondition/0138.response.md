Output State: **`ss` is the second character of the string `s`, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 2 **(since `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by `1 << (ord(`ss`) - ord('a'))`, and `ss` is the second character of `s`, so `cur_ss` is 1, thus `cur += 1 << 1` which equals `cur += 2`, making `cur` equal to 2)**, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `tmp` is 'd', `ans` is 'zdaa', `k` is at least 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur_ss` is equal to ord(`ss`) - ord('a').**
