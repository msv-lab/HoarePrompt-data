Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of 'b' repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 3, and `tmp` is 'c'**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` sets `tmp` to the character 'c', which is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + 3)`. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
