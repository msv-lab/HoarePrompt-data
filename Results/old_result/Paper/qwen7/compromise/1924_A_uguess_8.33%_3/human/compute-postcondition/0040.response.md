Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
