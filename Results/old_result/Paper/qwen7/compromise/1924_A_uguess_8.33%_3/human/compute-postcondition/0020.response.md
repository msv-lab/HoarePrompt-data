Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The values of `s` and `cur_ss` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `cur` is also not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `cnt` is now one more than its initial value.
