Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur` is either `(1 << (cur_ss + 1)) - 1` or remains as `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `cur_ss` is the integer value of the current character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since the other variables (`s`, `cur`, and `cur_ss`) are not affected by this line of code, their states remain the same as they were in the initial state.
