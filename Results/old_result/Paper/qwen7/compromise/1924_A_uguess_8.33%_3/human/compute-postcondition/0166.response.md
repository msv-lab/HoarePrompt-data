Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `tmp` is 'a'
- `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`
- `cur` is reset to 0
- `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`
- `k` retains its initial state
- `i` is 1
- The current value of `cur` satisfies `cur & 1 << i == 0`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Adjusting States
- **`tmp`**: This variable is set to 'a' at the beginning of each iteration, so it remains 'a'.
- **`cnt`**: This variable is used to count valid substrings and does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
- **`cur`**: This variable is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, so it remains 0.
- **`ans`**: This variable is constructed outside the loop and does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
- **`k`**: This variable retains its initial state and does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
- **`i`**: This variable starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.

### Next Iteration
At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

Since `cur` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` must still be satisfied. Given that `cur` is 0, this condition will always be true for any `i`.

### Updated State
- `tmp` remains 'a'
- `cnt` remains the same
- `cur` remains 0
- `ans` remains the same
- `k` remains the same
- `i` is now 2

### Final Answer
State: **`tmp` is 'a', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, and `i` is 2**
