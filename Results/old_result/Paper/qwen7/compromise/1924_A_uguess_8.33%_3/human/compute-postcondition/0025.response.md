Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the current character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 again, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the current character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur_ss` to be the integer value of the current character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
