Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an empty string.
- `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `ans` is a string consisting of 'c' repeated `cnt` times followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) times.
- `tmp` is 'c'.

The value of `ans` is determined by the formula given. Since `cnt` is less than `n`, let's break down `ans`:

- `'c'` is repeated `cnt` times.
- `'a'` is repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

Therefore, `ans` will be a string with `cnt` occurrences of 'c' followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` occurrences of 'a'. 

Output: **'c'*cnt + 'a'*(n-cnt-1)**
