Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ss in s:`. This means the loop variable `ss` iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. The other variables (`cur`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

3. **State the required conditions**: Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, `s` must have at least one character for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`s` is a string that must have at least one character**
