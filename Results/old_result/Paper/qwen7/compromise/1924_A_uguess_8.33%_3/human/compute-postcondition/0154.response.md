Output State: The loop continues until all characters in the string `s` have been processed. After all iterations, the variable `cnt` will hold the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, which corresponds to the number of substrings of length `k` in `s` where each character's binary representation bit matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. All other variables (`cur`, `i`, `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss`) will revert to their initial or final states as described in the problem statement. Specifically, `cur` will be reset to 0 after processing all characters in `s`, and `cnt` will contain the final count.

In natural language: After the loop has executed for all iterations, `cnt` will be the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. All other variables will retain their initial or final states as given, with `cur` being reset to 0 and `cnt` holding the final count.
