You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s in each test case consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:

            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cnt` will be the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. `cur` will be reset to 0, and `cnt` will contain the final count. If `cnt` is less than `n`, then `tmp` will be 'e', `ans` will be a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, and `k` will retain its initial state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the string `s` is too short to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
3
2 2 3
abb
2 2 4
abba
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

- Expected Output:
```
NO
YES
YES
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
NO
NO
NO
```

The issue lies in the logic used to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`. The program checks if a bitmask representing the presence of each character in the current substring matches `(1 << k) - 1`, indicating that all `k` characters are present. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in `s`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that every possible combination of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets is checked against the string `s`. The current implementation does not account for this requirement, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
