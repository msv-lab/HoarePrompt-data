The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \(t\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(m\), along with a string \(s\) consisting of the first \(k\) lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, it checks if there are at least \(n\) valid substrings of length \(k\) in \(s\) where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in a bitmask \(cur\). If the count of such substrings is at least \(n\), it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string \(ans\) consisting of \(cnt\) characters, each being the character at position \(k-1\) in the alphabet, followed by 'a' repeated \(n - cnt - 1\) times.
