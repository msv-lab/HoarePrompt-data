### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score under optimal play by both Alice and Bob. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to confirm its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It populates `cntl` with the counts of each element from `a`.

3. **Initial Check for Zero:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, the program prints `0`. This means there are no zeros in the array, and since Alice can pick any zero, the MEX will be `0`.

4. **Calculating MEX:**
   - The program calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`. This ensures that Alice can ensure at least two elements are picked, including possibly a zero.
   - It then iterates through the counts from `1` to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, it decrements `c` by `1`.
     - If `c` becomes `0` or it reaches the end of the loop, it prints `j`.

### Detailed Example Verification

Let's verify the example given in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `4 0 0 1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0, 0]`
- `c` is `min(2, 2) = 2`
- Iterate through `cntl`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 2` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `2`.
  - `j = 2`: `cntl[2] = 0` (less than 2), so `c` becomes `1`.
  - `j = 3`: `cntl[3] = 0` (less than 2), so `c` becomes `0`.
  - Print `2` (correct).

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `4 0 1 2 3`
- `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
- `c` is `min(2, 1) = 1`
- Iterate through `cntl`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 1` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `1`.
  - `j = 2`: `cntl[2] = 1` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `1`.
  - `j = 3`: `cntl[3] = 1` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `1`.
  - Print `1` (correct).

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `2 1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`
- `c` is `min(2, 0) = 0`
- Iterate through `cntl`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 2` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `0`.
  - Print `0` (correct).

### Conclusion
