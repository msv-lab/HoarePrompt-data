Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array \(a\) of size \(n\). Alice aims to maximize the MEX of her constructed array \(c\), while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in \(c\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice can only pick elements from \(a\) and append them to \(c\).
   - Bob can only pick and delete elements from \(a\).
   - The game ends when \(a\) is empty.
   - The MEX of \(c\) is determined by the smallest non-negative integer missing from \(c\).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - It counts the occurrences of each number in the input array \(a\) using the `cntl` list.
   - The logic for determining the MEX is as follows:
     - If there are no zeros in \(a\), the MEX is 0.
     - Otherwise, the MEX is determined by counting how many numbers appear fewer than twice. If more than two zeros are present, the MEX is 2; otherwise, it is the smallest number that appears fewer than twice.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice can ensure that the MEX is maximized by ensuring that the smallest missing number is as large as possible.
   - Bob can minimize the MEX by ensuring that the smallest missing number is as small as possible.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where there are no zeros in \(a\).
   - The logic for determining the MEX when zeros are present is correct and aligns with the optimal strategies of both players.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array \(c\) based on the optimal strategies of both players.

Correctness: **True**
