Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the input value itself, which determines the number of iterations, but since it is not explicitly named, we focus on the implicit variables that change within the loop.

2. **Determine the Variables to Adjust**: The variables that change within the loop and are relevant to the loop condition are `c`, `j`, `n`, and `cntl[2]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute again, the input value (which is the range limit) must be greater than 0. Since the loop is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, if the input is positive, the loop will continue.

4. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `c` is decreased by 3.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `cntl[2]` is less than 2.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `c` will be further decreased by 3.
   - `j` will be reset to 3.
   - `n` will remain greater than 2.
   - `cntl[2]` will remain less than 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`c` is decreased by 3, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2**.
