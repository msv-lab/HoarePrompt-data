Based on the initial state described:

- The list `cntl` will be updated such that each index `i` (where `i` is an element in the list `a`) will have a value equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` will be `0`.

The print statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
