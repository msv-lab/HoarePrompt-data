Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
   - Either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts from 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`, which is `2`.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `j` is currently 1, the loop can continue as long as `1 < n + 1`, which is always true since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `cntl[2]` must be checked to ensure it is less than 2 (though this is not directly modified by the loop itself).
   - The condition `c` being False or `j` equaling `n` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies `c` or `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, and either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`.**
