Postcondition: **The `cntl` list will contain the count of how many times each integer from the input list `a` appeared. Each index in `cntl` corresponds to an integer from `a`, and the value at that index represents the frequency of that integer in `a`. Currently, the value at index 0 of `cntl` is 0.**
