Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 (though its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement).
- `cntl[2]` is mentioned but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `c` is equal to the original value of `c` minus 1, but the original value of `c` is not specified, so this does not affect the print statement either.

The print statement only references `j`, which is explicitly given as 2.

Output: **2**
