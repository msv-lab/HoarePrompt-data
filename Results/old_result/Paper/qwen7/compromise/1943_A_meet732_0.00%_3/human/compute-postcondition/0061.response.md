Postcondition: **The value of `cntl[i]` for each index `i` in the list `a` will be incremented by the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`. All other variables (`c`, `j`, `n`, and `a`) will retain their final values from after the loop has completed its iterations. The variable `cntl` will be a list where each index corresponds to an element in `a`, and the value at each index represents how many times that particular element appeared in `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.**
