Output State: **`cntl[i]' is increased by 1, `a` must contain at least one element**.

The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `a` must contain at least one element remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `cntl[i]` has been incremented, while `a` still contains at least one element.
