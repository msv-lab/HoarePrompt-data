Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `j` is `n`. The variable `c` is reduced by `n-1` from its initial value. The variable `cntl[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `n` has been checked against 2, and if any `cntl[j]` was less than 2, `c` was decremented accordingly. If `c` became 0 or `j` reached `n`, the loop broke early.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the final value of `j` will be equal to `n`, and `c` will have been decremented by `n-1` from its initial value. The loop checks each `cntl[j]` for `j` from 1 to `n`, and if any `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it decreases `c` by 1. The loop breaks if `c` becomes 0 or when `j` reaches `n`.
