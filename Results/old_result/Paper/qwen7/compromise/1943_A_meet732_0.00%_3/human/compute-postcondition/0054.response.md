Output State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `a` must contain at least one element**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The loop condition checks if `a` contains at least one element, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `cntl[i]` is increased by 1, and `a` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
