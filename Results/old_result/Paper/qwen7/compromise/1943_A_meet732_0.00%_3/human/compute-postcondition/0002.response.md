Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is the integer value entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers input from the user, converts each element into an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the integer value entered by the user initially.
