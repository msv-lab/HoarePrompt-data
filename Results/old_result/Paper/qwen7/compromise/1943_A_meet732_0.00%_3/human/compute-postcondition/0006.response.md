Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be the value it had at the end of the current iteration plus 1.
   - The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is the iterable over which the loop iterates.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `cntl[i]` was increased by 1. This means `i` was the last element processed in the previous iteration.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`cntl[i+1]` is increased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`**. 

Since the exact value of `i` is not given, we can represent it symbolically. The key is that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`cntl[i+1]` is increased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`**.
