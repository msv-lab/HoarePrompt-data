You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either '-1' or a non-negative integer result. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`. Each line's content depends on the input provided during each iteration of the loop. If the sum of the three integers in a line is odd, it will print '-1'. Otherwise, it will print the calculated result based on the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and checks if their sum is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2` and prints this result. After processing all test cases, the function ends, printing a series of `-1` or calculated results based on the input provided.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Initial Check for Consistency:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total if it's a draw).
   - This check is necessary because the sum of the scores should be even for the scores to be achievable through the described game rules.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: Ensures that we do not subtract more than what is available from the scores of the other players. This term ensures that the calculation does not go negative.
     - Subtracting this term from the total points and dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of the scores is odd correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, the formula provided might not handle some edge cases correctly. Specifically, the formula assumes that the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores can be entirely attributed to draws, which might not always be true.

### Example Analysis:

- **Case 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Sum is `0`, which is even. Result: `0` (correct).

- **Case 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Sum is `2`, which is even. Result: `1` (correct).

- **Case 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Sum is `3`, which is odd. Result: `-1` (correct).

- **Case 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Sum is `4`, which is even. Result: `2` (correct).

- **Case 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Sum is `9`, which is odd. Result: `-1` (correct).

- **Case 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even. Result: `6` (correct).

- **Case 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even. Result: `2` (correct).

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the logic and the examples, the program appears to be correct in handling the given constraints and examples. The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws seems to work for the provided test cases.
