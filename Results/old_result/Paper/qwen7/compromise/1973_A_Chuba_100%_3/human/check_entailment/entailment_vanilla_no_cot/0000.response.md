Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1` is checking if the total score is odd. This is not sufficient to determine if the scores are consistent. For example, `1 1 2` should be possible with 2 draws, but the current check would incorrectly return `-1`.

2. **Calculation of Draws**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is incorrect. The current approach does not properly account for the distribution of wins and losses among the three players.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Check Consistency**: Ensure that the total points are even because each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points (1 to each in a draw).
2. **Calculate Maximum Draws**: Use the constraints to determine the maximum number of draws.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of games required
        min_games = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        # Each draw gives 2 points in total, and each win/loss gives 2 points in total
        # We need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are achievable
        max_draws = min_games - (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * p3) // 2
        
        # Ensure the calculated draws do not exceed the possible draws
        max_draws = min(max_draws, (p3 - p1) // 2)
        
        print(max_draws)


func()
```

This solution checks the consistency of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.
