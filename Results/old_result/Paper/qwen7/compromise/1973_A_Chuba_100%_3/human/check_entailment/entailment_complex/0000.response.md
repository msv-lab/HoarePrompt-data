Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`.
3. It checks if the sum of these scores is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through any combination of wins and draws.
4. If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[1] - v[0])) // 2`. This formula is derived from the fact that each win contributes 2 points to the total score, while each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players involved. Therefore, the maximum number of draws can be calculated by subtracting the minimum possible score difference (which is `max(0, v[2] - v[1] - v[0])`) from the total score and then dividing by 2.
5. The function handles all given examples correctly:
   - For `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and the result is 0.
   - For `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and the result is 1.
   - For `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), and the result is -1.
   - For `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and the result is 2.
   - For `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), and the result is -1.
   - For `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and the result is 6.
   - For `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), but the result should be 2, not 6, because the maximum number of draws cannot exceed the number of games played. The formula needs to be adjusted to ensure it does not overestimate the number of draws.

Given the above analysis, the function is almost correct but needs a minor adjustment in the calculation of the maximum number of draws to ensure it does not overestimate the number of draws.

Correctness: **False**
