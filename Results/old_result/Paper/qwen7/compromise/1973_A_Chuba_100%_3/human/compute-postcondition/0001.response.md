State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, _ is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is automatically set to 0 when the loop starts, as it is initialized in the `range(t)` function.
- The variable `t` is determined by the user input, and it must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) for the loop to execute.
- No other variables or states need to be adjusted since they are not mentioned in the loop head.
