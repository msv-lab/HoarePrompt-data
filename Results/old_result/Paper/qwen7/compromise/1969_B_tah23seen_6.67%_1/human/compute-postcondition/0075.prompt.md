Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 8, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `right` will be equal to the length of the list `s`. This is because the loop continues to increment `right` as long as `right` is less than the length of `s` and `s[right]` is not '0'. Once `right` reaches the length of `s` or `s[right]` becomes '0', the condition `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'` fails, and the loop terminates. Therefore, the final state of `right` will be the length of the list `s`. The other variables (`sChar`, `i`, `s`, `left`, `cost`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states since the loop does not modify them.
Code of the loop:
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 8, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, `left` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is increased by 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is increased by 1 and is still less than `len(s)`, `s[left]` must not be '1'.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
