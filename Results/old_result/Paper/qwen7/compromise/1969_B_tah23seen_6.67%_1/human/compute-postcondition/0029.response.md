Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is 2.
   - `cost` is 2.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
   - For every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0'.
   - `len(s)` must be greater than 1.
   - `s[1]` must not be '1'.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop condition requires two conditions to be true: `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.
   - Since `left` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'` for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - `left` is currently 2. To satisfy `left < len(s)`, `len(s)` must be greater than 2.
   - `s[left]` is `s[2]`. We need to ensure that `s[2] != '1'`.

5. **Final state**:
   - `s` must have more than 2 elements (i.e., `len(s) > 2`).
   - `s[2]` must not be '1'.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`s` must have more than 2 elements and `s[2]` must not be '1'**
