Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0'.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` + 2.
   - `cost` is 4.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop condition checks two things: `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - `left` is equal to the length of `s` + 2.
   - `len(s)` is the number of characters in the list `s`, which is the same as the length of `sChar` (since `s` contains every character of `sChar`).
   - Since `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `len(s)` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, `left` is `len(s) + 2`, which means `left` is always greater than `len(s)` because `len(s)` is at least 1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that `left` is always `len(s) + 2`, the condition `left < len(s)` is always false.
   - There is no way to satisfy the condition `left < len(s)` based on the current state.

Since the condition `left < len(s)` cannot be satisfied, the loop will not execute again under the given state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` + 2, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`**. The loop cannot execute one more time because the condition `left < len(s)` is always false.
