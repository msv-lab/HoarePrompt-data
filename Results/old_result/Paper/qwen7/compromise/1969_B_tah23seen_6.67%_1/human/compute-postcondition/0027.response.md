Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'`.
2. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is 1.
   - `cost` is 2.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
   - For every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0'.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.
   - Given that `left` is initially set to 1, we need to ensure that `1 < len(s)` and `s[1] != '1'`.

4. **Check the constraints**:
   - Since `s` is a list of characters from a non-empty binary string `sChar`, `len(s)` is at least 1.
   - However, we need to ensure that `s[1]` is not '1' for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 1 and `s[1]` is not '1'.

Given these considerations, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and for every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0', and `len(s)` must be greater than 1 and `s[1]` must not be '1'**.
