Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.

In this final output state, the loop has executed for each character in the binary string `sChar`. The variable `s` now contains a list of all characters from `sChar`, in the order they appeared.
