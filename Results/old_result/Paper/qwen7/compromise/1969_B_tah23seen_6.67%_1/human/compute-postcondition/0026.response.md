Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and for every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0'.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `right` will be equal to the length of the list `s`, indicating that the loop has processed all characters in `s`. Additionally, none of the characters in `s` are '0', as the condition inside the loop increments `right` only if `s[right]` is not '0'. The values of `left` and `cost` remain unchanged at 1 and 2, respectively.
