Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s` plus 1, and `s[right]` must not be '0'.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was equal to the length of `s`. After the increment, `right` is now one more than the length of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
