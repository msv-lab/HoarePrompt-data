Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 8, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `right` will point to the last index of the list `s`. This is because the loop continues to increment `right` as long as `right` is less than the length of `s` and the character at `s[right]` is not '0'. Once `right` reaches the last index of `s` or the character at `s[right]` becomes '0', the condition in the while loop will no longer be satisfied, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, `right` will be set to the length of `s`, which is the same as the index of the last element in the list `s`.
