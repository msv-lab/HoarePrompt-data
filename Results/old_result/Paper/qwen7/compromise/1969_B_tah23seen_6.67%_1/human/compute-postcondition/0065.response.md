Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 8, `right` is equal to the length of `s` plus 1**.

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was equal to the length of `s`. After executing the code, `right` is now equal to the length of `s` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
