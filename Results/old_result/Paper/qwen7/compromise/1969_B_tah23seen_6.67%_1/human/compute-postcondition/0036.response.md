Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and `s[right-1]` is swapped with `s[left]`.**

Explanation: The code swaps the characters at positions `right` and `left` in the list `s`. Since `right` is equal to the length of `s` and `left` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, the swap effectively swaps the last character in the list `s` with itself, which means no actual change occurs. However, the positions of the characters in the list `s` are updated accordingly.
