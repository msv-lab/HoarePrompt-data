Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is 4, `s[1]` must not be '0', `len(s)` must be at least 2, and `s[3]` must not be '0'**.

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was 3, so now `right` is 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
