Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `left` and `s`.
3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `left` is increased by 1.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied:
- `left < len(s)`
- `s[left] != '1'`

Given that `left` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `left` as `left_new`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `left_new < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that `left` is still within the bounds of the string `s`.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left_new] != '1'`**
   - This condition ensures that the character at the new position of `left` is not '1'.

Since `left` is increased by 1, we need to ensure that `left_new` (the new value of `left`) satisfies both conditions. 

To satisfy these conditions, we need to ensure:
- `left_new` is still less than `len(s)`.
- `s[left_new]` is not '1'.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `left` should be such that it can still satisfy both conditions for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`left` must be less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` must not be '1'**
