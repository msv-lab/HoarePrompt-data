Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute the first time.

Given:
- `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0'.
- `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
- `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
- `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1.
- `cost` is 8.
- `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to check the loop condition:
1. `left < len(s)` - This condition is true because `left` is set to `len(s) - 1` initially, and `len(s)` is the length of the list `s`.
2. `s[left] != '1'` - This condition checks if the character at position `left` in the list `s` is not '1'.

Since `sChar` ends with '0', the last character in `s` (which is `s[left]` where `left = len(s) - 1`) is '0'. Therefore, the condition `s[left] != '1'` is always true.

Thus, the only condition that needs to be checked is `left < len(s)`, which is already true. No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time based on the given conditions.

State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 8, `right` is equal to the length of `s`**
