Postcondition: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is 0, and these conditions hold: if the character at position `right` (which is `s[0]`) is '0' and the character at position `left` (which is `s[1]`) is '1', then `left` is set to 1 and `cost` is set to 2; otherwise, no changes are made to `left` and `cost`.
