Postcondition: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and if `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`, then `s[left]` and `s[right-1]` are swapped.**
