Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 16, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, both `left` and `right` will be equal to the length of the list `s`. This is because the loop continues to increment `left` and `right` until they reach the length of `s`, and the condition `left <= right and right < len(s) and left < len(s)` ensures that the loop terminates when these conditions fail. Since the loop processes all characters in `s` and increments `cost` by `right - left + 1` each time it swaps a '0' and '1', the total `cost` will be the sum of all such increments, which in this case, given the pattern of increments, results in a `cost` of 16. The values of `sChar`, `i`, `s`, `left`, `cost`, and `right` remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration, as the loop does not alter these variables further.
