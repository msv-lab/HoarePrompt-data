You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a binary string `sChar` and performs a series of swaps to ensure that all '1's are moved to the left side of the string while all '0's are moved to the right side. During this process, it calculates and returns a cost value of 16.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the minimum cost.
   - The function `func_1(s)`:
     - Converts the string `sChar` into a list of characters.
     - Initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable.
     - Iterates through the string to find positions where a swap can reduce the cost.
     - Swaps characters when a '0' is found to the left of a '1' and updates the cost.
     - Moves the `left` and `right` pointers appropriately to find the next possible swaps.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` seems to correctly identify positions where a swap can be made to reduce the cost.
   - It correctly calculates the cost of each swap by the length of the substring involved.
   - The algorithm iterates through the string and performs necessary swaps until no more swaps can reduce the cost.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted, the function returns 0, which is correct.
   - If the string has no '1's or '0's, the function will also return 0, which is correct.
   - The function handles the cyclic shift by swapping characters directly, which is a valid approach.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation.

Correctness: **True**
