Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is updated based on the loop body, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `res`, `arr`, and `mini`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as they were in the initial state. The output state includes the updated value of `n` and mentions that `res`, `arr`, and `mini` are still updated based on the loop body, as no specific changes to these variables are made in this line of code.
