Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, `arr` is a list containing the value `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is initially `i + 1`, appending `i` to `arr` means `arr` now contains the value `i + 1`. All other variables (`n` and `res`) remain unchanged.
