Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
- `res` is either the new input string which is equal to '>', or the original `res` string. However, this does not affect the print statement since it is not used in the print statement.
- `arr` must have at least 3 elements.
- `item` is the third element of `arr`.
- `mini` is the third element of `arr`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here, `mini` and `item` both refer to the third element of `arr`. Since `arr` must have at least 3 elements, let's denote the third element of `arr` as `x`. Therefore, both `mini` and `item` will be `x`.

The print statement will output the string `?` followed by `x` twice and then `x` twice again.

Output: **? x x x x**
