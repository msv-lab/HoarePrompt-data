Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but no specific value is provided for `n`.

Given the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

We need to determine the values of `maxi` and `arr[0]`. However, neither `maxi` nor `arr` are defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot provide precise values for these variables. 

The output will include the string `'?'`, followed by the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi` again, and `i` (which is 2).

Output: **'? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2'**
