Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is a value in the range [1, n-1]
   - `n` must be at least 4
   - `res` is a string
   - `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Head Variables**: 
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Postconditions Based on `res`**:
   - If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` contains the value of `i`.
   - If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` remains unchanged.
   - If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` still contains the value of `i`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `res` and `arr` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, these values stay the same.

7. **New State**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains at least 4.
   - `res` and `arr` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is a string, and `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`**.
