Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, and `arr` remains unchanged, `res` is assigned the value of `input()`**.

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `res`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
