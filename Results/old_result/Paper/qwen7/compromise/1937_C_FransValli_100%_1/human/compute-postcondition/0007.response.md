Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 1, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'**.

Explanation: The variable `maxi` is assigned the value of `i`, which is initially 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
