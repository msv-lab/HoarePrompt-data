Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is the final input string received after the last iteration, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `mini` is now equal to the last element of `arr` if `res` is equal to '>', otherwise `mini` remains unchanged.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will still be equal to the initial value of `n`. The variable `res` will hold the input string received during the last iteration of the loop. The list `arr` will have at least `n` elements, and `mini` will be set to the last element of `arr` if the input received during the last iteration was '>', otherwise, `mini` will retain its value from before the loop started or from any previous iteration where the condition was not met.
