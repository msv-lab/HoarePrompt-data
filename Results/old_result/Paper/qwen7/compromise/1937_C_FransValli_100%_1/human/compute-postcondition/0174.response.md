Output State: **`maxi` is 2, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>', and n is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. The values of `maxi`, `i`, `arr`, `mini`, and the condition for `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The exact values of `arr` and `mini` depend on the loop body (which is not provided), but they are updated accordingly based on the condition and the input string `res`.
