Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 2, `res` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. Since no specific value is provided for the input, `res` now holds the string entered by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
