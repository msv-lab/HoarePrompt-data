Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi` is not provided in the initial state, so it cannot be determined precisely.
- `arr[0]`: Since `arr` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents. However, if we assume `arr` is a list, `arr[0]` would refer to the first element of `arr`.
- `maxi`: Again, this is the same as above; the value of `maxi` is not provided.
- `i`: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.

Given these points, the output will include the literal string `'?'`, followed by `maxi`, then `arr[0]`, then `maxi` again, and finally the value of `i` which is 1.

Output: **'? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 1' (where [maxi] is the value of maxi and [arr[0]] is the first element of the list arr)**
