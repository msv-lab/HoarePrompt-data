Output State: **`item` is `arr[n-1]`, `mini` is the minimum value encountered in the array `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` based on the user's input ('>') comparisons during each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `res` is an input string reflecting the user's choice ('<' or '>') for each comparison.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but does not affect the values of `item`, `mini`, or `res`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `item`, `mini`, and `res`, while updating `n` to the input integer.
