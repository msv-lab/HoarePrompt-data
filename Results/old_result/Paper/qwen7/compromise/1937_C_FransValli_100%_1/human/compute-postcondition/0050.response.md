Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, `arr` is `[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` updates the list `arr` to contain only the element `i`. The value of `i` is `i_prev + 1` from the initial state. All other variables (`n`, `res`, and `arr`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
