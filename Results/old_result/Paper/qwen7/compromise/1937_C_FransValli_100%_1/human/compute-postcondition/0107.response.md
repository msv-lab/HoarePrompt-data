Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is equal to '<'; `arr` is a list containing the element 1.**

The code creates a list `arr` containing the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `n` must still be greater than 0, and `res` remains an input string with its current value being '<'.
