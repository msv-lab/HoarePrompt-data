Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 10.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `arr` is either `[i]` or `[0, i]`.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the condition `res == '<'` is met.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `arr` will be updated to `[i]` or `[0, i]` based on the new value of `i`.
   - `maxi` remains `n-1`.
   - `res` remains unchanged.
   - `mini` will be updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the condition `res == '<'` is met.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `total` remains 10.
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `arr` will be updated to `[i]` or `[0, i]` based on the new value of `i`.
   - `maxi` remains `n-1`.
   - `res` remains unchanged.
   - `mini` will be updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the condition `res == '<'` is met.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is either `[i]` or `[0, i]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the condition `res == '<'` is met.**
