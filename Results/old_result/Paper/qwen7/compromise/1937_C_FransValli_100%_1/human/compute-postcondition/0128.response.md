Output State: **`res` is a string from input(), `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `arr` is a list with the value 3 appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` now contains the value 3, while `res` retains its original value from the input, `i` remains 3, and `n` is still greater than 0.
