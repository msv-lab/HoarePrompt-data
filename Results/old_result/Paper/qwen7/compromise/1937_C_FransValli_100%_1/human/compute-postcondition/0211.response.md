Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[0]`, `i` equals `n`, `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` in any order, `maxi` equals `n-1`, `mini` equals `n-1` if `res` was `'> '` for all iterations, otherwise `mini` is undefined as the condition was never met, `total` is 10, and `res` is an input value from the user for the last iteration.**

Explanation: The line `mini = arr[0]` assigns the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `mini`. Since `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` in any order, `arr[0]` could be any integer from 0 to `n-1`. However, without knowing the exact value of `arr[0]`, we express `mini` as `arr[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
