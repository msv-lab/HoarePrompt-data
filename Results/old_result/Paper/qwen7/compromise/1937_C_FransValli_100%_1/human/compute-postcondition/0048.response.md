Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is defined as `i_prev + 1`.
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - `arr` is a list containing `[i + 1]` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `arr` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we need to determine the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, and `i`.

- Since `i` is defined as `i_prev + 1`, we know `i` is one more than `i_prev`.
- The value of `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`:
  - If `res == '<'`, then `arr` becomes `[i + 1]`, so `arr[0] = i + 1`.
  - Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged, and since it was initially empty or unchanged, `arr[0]` remains undefined or unchanged from its previous state.
- `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value without additional information.

Given the lack of specific values for `i_prev`, `res`, and `maxi`, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **'? [maxi] [i + 1] [maxi] [i_prev + 1]** (where `maxi` is unknown, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `arr[0]` is `i + 1` if `res == '<'` otherwise unchanged)
