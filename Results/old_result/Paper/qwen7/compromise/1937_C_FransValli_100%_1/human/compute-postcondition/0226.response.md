Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is explicitly given as 10.
- `res` is the user's input value, but since it is not used in the print statement, its value does not affect the output.
- `arr` has at least 3 elements, but since it is not used in the print statement, its value does not affect the output.
- `mini` retains its original value, but the original value is not specified, so we will keep it as `mini`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here, `item` is not defined anywhere in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. Therefore, we will leave it as `item`.

Output: **? mini mini item item**
