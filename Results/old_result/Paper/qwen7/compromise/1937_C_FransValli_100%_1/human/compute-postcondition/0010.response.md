Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `i` is 1
   - `maxi` is 1
   - `res` is an input string, where the value of `res` is '<'

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1. After one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be within the range defined by `range(1, n)`, which means `i` should be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (which it already is as per the initial condition).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `maxi` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `res` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 1, and `res` is an input string, where the value of `res` is '<'**
