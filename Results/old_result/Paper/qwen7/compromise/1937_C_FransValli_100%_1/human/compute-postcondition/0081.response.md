Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `item` is `arr[n-1]`, `mini` is the minimum value encountered in the array `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` based on the user's input ('>') comparisons during each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `res` is an input string reflecting the user's choice ('<' or '>') for each comparison.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = 0` initializes the variable `maxi` to 0. This does not affect the values of `item`, `mini`, `n`, or `res`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
