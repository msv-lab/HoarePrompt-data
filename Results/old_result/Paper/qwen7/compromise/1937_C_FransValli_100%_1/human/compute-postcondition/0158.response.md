Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is updated based on the loop body, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`**

Explanation: The line `maxi = 0` initializes the variable `maxi` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `res`, `arr`, or `mini`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
