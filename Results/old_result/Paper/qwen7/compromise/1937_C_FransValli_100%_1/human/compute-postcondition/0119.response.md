Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `res` is an input string; `arr` contains the element 2**

The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` must still be greater than 0, `res` remains an input string, and `arr` now contains the element 2.
