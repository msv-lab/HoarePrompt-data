Output State: **`maxi` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `res`. The values of `maxi`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `mini` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid. The exact values of `arr` and `mini` depend on the loop body which is not provided, but they are updated based on the condition and the input string `res`.
