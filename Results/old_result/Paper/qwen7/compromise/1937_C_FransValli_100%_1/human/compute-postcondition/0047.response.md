Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - `arr` is a list containing `[i + 1]` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `arr` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`.
   - We need to find the initial value of `i` from the previous state. Let's assume the previous value of `i` was `i_prev`.
   - Therefore, `i_new = i_prev + 1`.

5. **Determine the new condition for `n`**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i_new < n`.
   - Given that `n` must be at least 4, we can keep this condition as it is.

6. **Determine the state of `res` and `arr`**:
   - The values of `res` and `arr` remain unchanged from the previous iteration since they are not modified within the loop head.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so if the previous `i` was `i_prev`, then `i` is now `i_prev + 1`.
- `n` must still be at least 4.
- `res` remains the same.
- `arr` remains the same.

Since we don't know the exact previous value of `i`, we can represent it as `i_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, and `arr` is a list containing `[i + 1]` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `arr` remains unchanged.**
