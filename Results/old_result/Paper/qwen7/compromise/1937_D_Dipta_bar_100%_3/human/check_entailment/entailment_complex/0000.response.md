Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball moves based on the direction indicated by the character in the current cell and changes the direction after moving.

2. **Function Breakdown**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative sums related to the positions of `>` and `<` characters, respectively.
   - **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
     - For `A`: It calculates the cumulative sum of distances to the nearest `>` from the left.
     - For `B`: It calculates the cumulative sum of distances to the nearest `<` from the right.
   - **Time Calculation**:
     - The main loop iterates through each cell, using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The logic involves checking the direction of the current cell and updating the time based on the cumulative sums and positions of `>` and `<` characters.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The logic for computing `A` and `B` is correct. It correctly captures the distance to the nearest `>` and `<` from the left and right, respectively.
   - **Time Calculation**: The main loop correctly uses these cumulative sums to compute the time for the pinball to leave the grid. The expressions used in the loop match the problem's requirements and handle edge cases properly.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells (`<` or `>` at the start or end of the grid).

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
