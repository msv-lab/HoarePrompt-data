### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description:
- The pinball moves based on the direction (`<` or `>`) in each cell.
- The direction is inverted after each move.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` calculates and prints the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each index in the string `s`.
- The calculation involves cumulative sums of indices of `>` and `<` characters and their positions.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Calculating Time for Each Index:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the time for each index.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store cumulative sums of indices of `>` and `<` characters, respectively.
   - These cumulative sums are used to calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid using a complex formula involving these sums and the positions of the characters.

3. **Complex Formula:**
   - The formula used in the program is based on the cumulative sums and positions of `>` and `<` characters.
   - The formula seems to be attempting to account for the movement and inversion rules, but it is overly complex and does not align with the simple movement logic described in the problem statement.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1: `"><<"`**
   - Expected Output: `3 6 5`
   - The program does not produce the correct output. This indicates that the formula used in the program is incorrect.

2. **Test Case 2: `"<<<<"`**
   - Expected Output: `1 2 3 4`
   - The program does not produce the correct output. This further confirms that the formula is incorrect.

3. **Test Case 3: `<><<<<`**
   - Expected Output: `1 4 7 10 8 1`
   - The program does not produce the correct output. This again confirms that the formula is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the rules for the pinball's movement and does not produce the expected results for all inputs. The complex formula used in the program does not align with the simple movement and inversion rules described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
