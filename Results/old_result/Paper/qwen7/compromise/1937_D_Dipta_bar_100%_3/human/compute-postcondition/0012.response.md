Output State: **`r` is equal to the length of `B`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of indices greater than the previous one encountered, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of '<' characters in `s`, `l` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r = len(B)` assigns the length of the list `B` to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
