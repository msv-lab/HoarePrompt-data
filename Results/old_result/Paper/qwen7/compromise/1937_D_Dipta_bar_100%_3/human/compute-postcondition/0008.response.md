Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is the loop variable that will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `n` is a constant representing the length of the string `s`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `n` is a constant and does not change within the loop, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `j` needs to be set to `0` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of indices greater than the previous one encountered.
- `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` is an empty list.
- `idx_B` is an empty list.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `j` to `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of string `s`**
