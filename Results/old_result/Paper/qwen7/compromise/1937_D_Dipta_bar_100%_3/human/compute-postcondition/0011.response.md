Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of indices greater than the previous one encountered, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of '<' characters in `s`, `l` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `l` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, or `idx_B`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `l` is updated to 0.
