Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, the variables \( a \), \( b \), and \( m \) are correctly initialized using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Calculation of Fireworks Visibility**:
   - The variable \( A \) is calculated as \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
   - The variable \( B \) is calculated as \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1 \).

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The sum \( A + B \) is computed, which represents the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
   - This value is printed for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases well, including when \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, and when \( m \) is very large.

Given the problem description and the example inputs and outputs, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
