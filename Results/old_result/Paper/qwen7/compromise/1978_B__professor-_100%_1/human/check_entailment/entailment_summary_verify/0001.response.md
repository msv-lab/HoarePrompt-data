### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - The profit calculation depends on the value of \( k \), which ranges from 0 to \(\min(n, b)\).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It checks different conditions to determine the optimal \( k \):

     - **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). This is handled correctly with `print(n * a)`.

     - **Case 2:** If \( b - a \geq n \), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the modified prices starting from \( b \) down to \( b - n + 1 \). This is also handled correctly with `print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))`.

     - **Case 3:** Otherwise, the best strategy involves selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price. This is handled with `print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))`.

3. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the correctness of the code by analyzing the formulas used in each case.
   
   - **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \), the profit is indeed \( n \times a \).
   
   - **Case 2:** If \( b - a \geq n \), the profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is \( b \) and the last term is \( b - n + 1 \). The sum of this series is given by:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \left(2b - n + 1\right)
     \]
     This matches the formula used in the code: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
   
   - **Case 3:** If \( b - a < n \), the profit is calculated by summing the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining buns. The sum of the modified prices is:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) = \frac{k(b - a + 1)}{2}
     \]
     Adding the usual price for the remaining buns gives:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{k(b - a + 1)}{2} + a(n - k)
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a(n - (b - a))
     \]
     This matches the formula used in the code: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code logic matches the problem statement and handles all possible scenarios correctly.
   - The calculations for profit are accurate based on the given conditions.
