State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because the `range(t)` function will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
- The initial state of `t` being an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute, hence it needs to be adjusted to ensure `t > 0`.
