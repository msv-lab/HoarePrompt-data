Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If `s` has only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the sorted version of `s` in ascending order or its reverse in descending order, depending on which matches the original string `s`.**
