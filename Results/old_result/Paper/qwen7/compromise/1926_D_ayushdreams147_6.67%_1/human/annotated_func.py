#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is the count of unique numbers in the list `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is a transformed version of the numbers in `a` and the value is the difference between the initial count of that transformed number and the count after applying the operation.
    return res
    #The program returns the count of unique numbers in the list 'a' after applying the bitwise operation num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, stored in 'res'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It applies the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element in `a`, counts the unique results of these operations, and returns the count of these unique numbers.
