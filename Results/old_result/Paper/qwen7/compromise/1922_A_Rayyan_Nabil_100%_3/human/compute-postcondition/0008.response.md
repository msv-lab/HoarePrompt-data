Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). It processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the given conditions for each test case.**

However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, the description should focus on the implied inputs and their constraints:
