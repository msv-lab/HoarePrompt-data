Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `result` which is being iterated over from the `results` list.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The variable `result` is being used in the loop body, but the loop itself doesn't change the value of `result`. It only iterates over the existing values in the `results` list.
   - The list `results` is already populated with `t` integers, each of which is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
   - Since the loop is iterating over the `results` list, the only state that needs to be considered is the state of the `results` list itself.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - The `results` list must contain `t` integers, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
   - Each integer in the list is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for some inputs `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly is the state of the `results` list.

**State:**
**`results` is a list containing `t` integers (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`), each integer is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for corresponding inputs `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`**.
