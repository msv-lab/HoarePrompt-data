Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the specified range, and `results` is now an empty list.
