Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` up to length `n`.
   - If for any index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, it immediately returns 'YES'.
   - If no such index is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic correctly checks if `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`, or if for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then `b[i]` must be equal to `c[i]`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `results` to store the results.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes each test case and prints the appropriate result ('YES' or 'NO') for each case.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_2`, and prints the results.
   - The logic in both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
