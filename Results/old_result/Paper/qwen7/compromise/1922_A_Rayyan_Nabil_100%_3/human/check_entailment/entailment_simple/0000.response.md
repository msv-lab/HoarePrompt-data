Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the characters of strings `a` and `b` at index `i` are different from the character of string `c` at the same index. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic correctly identifies whether there exists a template such that both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. It essentially checks if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` for any `i`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - It collects the results of `func_1` calls in a list and prints them out.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results as required.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program structure is correct and follows the problem statement precisely.
   - The functions are well-defined and their interactions ensure that the program works as expected.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
