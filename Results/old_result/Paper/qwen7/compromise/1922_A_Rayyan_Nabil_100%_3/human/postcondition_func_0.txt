The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (between 1 and 20), and two strings `a` and `b` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, along with a third string `c` also consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. It checks whether `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`, or for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then `b[i]` must be equal to `c[i]`. If any index `i` violates this condition, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
