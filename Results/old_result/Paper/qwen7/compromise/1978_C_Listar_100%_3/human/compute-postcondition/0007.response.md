Output State: **The program returns a value that is the result of calling func_5 with the argument l, where l itself is the result of calling func_1 with arguments n and k.**

This means that the program first calls `func_1(n, k)` with the given values of `n` and `k`, and stores the result in `l`. Then, it calls `func_5(l)` with `l` as its argument and returns the result of this second function call. However, without knowing the definitions of `func_1` and `func_5`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value that will be returned.
