The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_4()` and `func_1()`. It first checks if `n` (obtained from `func_4()`) is zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately. Otherwise, it calls `func_1()` with `n` and `k` (also obtained from `func_4()`), then calls `func_5()` with the result of `func_1()`, and finally returns the result of `func_5()`.
