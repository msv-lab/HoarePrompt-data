### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**: This function determines whether a valid permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`. It ensures that `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible `k` for a given `n`. If `k` exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists. Otherwise, it returns the pair `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function constructs a permutation based on the initial values of `n` and `k`. It iteratively modifies the list `l` by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The function uses helper functions `func_2` and `func_3` to perform specific swaps.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function swaps two specific elements in the list `l` based on the indices `-c` and `-c - k`.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function swaps two specific elements in the list `l` based on the indices `-c` and `c - 1`.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function prints the permutation if it exists and returns an empty list.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function orchestrates the entire process by calling `func_4` to get the initial values of `n` and `k`, then calls `func_1` to construct the permutation, and finally calls `func_5` to print the result.

### Analysis:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `n` is odd, the maximum possible `k` is \((n^2 - 1) / 2\).
  - When `n` is even, the maximum possible `k` is \(n^2 / 2\).

- **Constructing Permutations**:
  - The construction logic in `func_1` ensures that the Manhattan value is achieved by carefully swapping elements. The swaps are designed to minimize the absolute differences between the permutation elements and their positions.

- **Validation**:
  - `func_4` correctly identifies when no valid permutation exists.
  - `func_1` constructs a valid permutation if one exists.
  - `func_5` correctly prints the permutation if it exists.

Given the detailed breakdown and the execution summaries, the functions collectively ensure that the program meets the problem requirements. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.
