Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `array`. The values of `i`, `input_value`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
