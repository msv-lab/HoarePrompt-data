Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j] + 97`, and `j` is increased by 1, and the value of `s[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `s[j]`.
