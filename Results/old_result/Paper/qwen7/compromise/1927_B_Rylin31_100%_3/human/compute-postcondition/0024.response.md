Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it, `j` is the first element of the `array`**

Explanation: The code appends to the string `ans` a character derived from the value of `s[j]` by adding 97 to it and converting the resulting integer to a character using `chr()`. Here, `j` is the first element of the `array`, which means `j` is the first integer in the list obtained from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.
