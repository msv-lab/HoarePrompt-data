Output State: **`array` must contain at least one element; `ans` is `ans` plus the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` updates the variable `ans` by adding the character that corresponds to the value of `s[j] + 97` to it. The value of `array` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this line of code. The exact value of `ans` depends on the current value of `ans` and the value of `s[j] + 97`, which is a character shifted by 97 positions in the alphabet (assuming `s[j]` is an integer representing a character's ASCII value).
