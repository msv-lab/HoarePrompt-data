Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `l` is the integer input value.**

Explanation: The variable `i` retains its initial value of 0. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned in the initial state description but not used in the code. The variable `l` is assigned the value of the integer input, which is obtained from `int(input())`.
