Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for j in array:`. The variables involved here are `j` and `array`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `array` must contain at least one element. This condition is met at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s[j]` is incremented by 1. This means that `j` is an element of `array`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `array` must still contain at least one element. Since `j` was an element of `array` in the previous iteration, removing `j` from `array` would violate the condition that `array` must contain at least one element.
   - Therefore, `array` must still contain at least one element, and `j` must be one of the elements of `array`.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `array`, which must still contain at least one element.
   - `s[j]` being incremented by 1 does not affect the loop condition directly, but it indicates that `j` was an element of `array` in the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the new state should reflect that `array` must still contain at least one element, and `j` must be one of those elements.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`array` must contain at least one element, and `s[j]` is incremented by 1**.
