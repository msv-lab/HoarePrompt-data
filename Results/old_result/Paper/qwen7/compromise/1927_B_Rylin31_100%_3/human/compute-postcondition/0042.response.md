Output State: **`array` must contain at least one element; `s[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `array` still contains at least one element, and `s[j]` has been incremented by 1.
