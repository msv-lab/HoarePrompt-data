Output State: **`array` must contain at least one element; `ans` is the concatenation of `ans` and the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97`; `s[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `s[j]` has been incremented by 1.
