Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which is not the correct approach. Instead, the program should aim to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings.

To fix this, we need to scan through the string and remove characters when encountering "map" or "pie" to minimize deletions. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        i = 0
        deletions = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if s[i:i+3] == 'map':
                deletions += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
            elif s[i:i+3] == 'pie':
                deletions += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(deletions)

func()
```

This corrected program scans through the string and removes characters when it finds "map" or "pie", ensuring the minimum number of deletions.
