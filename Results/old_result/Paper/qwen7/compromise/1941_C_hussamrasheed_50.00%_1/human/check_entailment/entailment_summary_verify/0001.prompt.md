You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' and 'pie' in each string `s`, sums these counts, and prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the sum of counts of 'map' and 'pie' for each input string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s` using `m = s.count('map')`.
   - It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using `s = s.replace('map', '')`.
   - After removing "map", it counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` using `p = s.count('pie')`.

3. **Calculating Result:**
   - The program prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Handling of "pie":**
   - The program only counts the occurrences of "pie" after removing all "map" substrings. However, this approach does not guarantee that the remaining string is free of "pie". For example, consider the string "piepie". After removing "map", the string remains "piepie", and the program would count two "pie" substrings but should actually require no removals since "pie" is not present.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic of counting "pie" after removing "map" is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that "pie" might still exist in the string even after removing "map".

3. **Example Test Case:**
   - Consider the string "piepie". The program would output 2, but no characters need to be removed since "pie" is not present after removing "map".

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that both "pie" and "map" are checked simultaneously without modifying the string in between. We can use regular expressions to find and remove the shortest possible substrings ("map" or "pie") iteratively until neither is found.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import re

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        # Use regex to find and remove the shortest possible substrings
        while 'map' in s or 'pie' in s:
            s = re.sub(r'map|pie', '', s)
        print(len(s))
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic of counting "pie" after removing "map". Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
