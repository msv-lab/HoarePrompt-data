Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the respective strings provided for each iteration of the loop. For each input integer `t`, there will be `t` such outputs, where each output is the result of counting the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s` for that particular iteration and then printing their sum.
