Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in determining the maximum balance. The program attempts to find the maximum GCD by iterating through potential divisors, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the optimal solution involves a GCD larger than the square root of `x`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the program considers the possibility of the GCD being larger than the square root of `x`. Hereâ€™s an improved version of the code:

```python
from math import gcd, isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    # Check if n divides x directly
    if x % n == 0:
        ans = x // n
    else:
        # Iterate over possible GCD values
        for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= x // (x // i):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

This updated code ensures that both smaller and larger GCD possibilities are considered, thereby finding the maximum balance correctly.
