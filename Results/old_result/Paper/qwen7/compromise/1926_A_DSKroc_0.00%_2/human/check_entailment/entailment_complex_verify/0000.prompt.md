You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB

    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: Output State: All characters in the string `s` have been iterated over `t` times, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the total count of non-'A' characters in `s`. The variable `q` ranges from 0 to `t-1` after all iterations, and `s` is the original input string without any modifications. `i` is irrelevant since the loop has completed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ac` will hold the total number of 'A' characters in the input string `s`, `bc` will hold the total number of non-'A' characters in `s`, `q` will range from 0 to `t-1` (where `t` is the initial input), and `s` will remain unchanged as no modifications were made to it within the loop.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: 'A'
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: 'B'
    #State: All characters in the string `s` have been iterated over `t` times, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the total count of non-'A' characters in `s`. The variable `q` ranges from 0 to `t-1` after all iterations, and `s` remains unchanged. Furthermore, if `ac` is greater than `bc`, the condition holds true; otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) and an input string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string `s`. After processing, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', and prints 'B' otherwise. The function does not modify the input string `s` and returns nothing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5, and the program iterates through each character to count occurrences, it will always produce the correct result for any valid input string consisting of 'A' and 'B'. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description.
