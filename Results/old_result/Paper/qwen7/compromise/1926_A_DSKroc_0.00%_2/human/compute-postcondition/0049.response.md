Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. This means the variables involved are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the variable used to iterate over each character in the string `s`.
   - `s` is the input string.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string because the loop iterates over each character in `s`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is the iterating variable, it will start from the first character of the string `s` in the first iteration.
   - The string `s` must be non-empty for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must be a non-empty string.
- `i` must be set to the first character of `s`.

State: **`ac` is 0, `bc` is 0, `q` is `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `s`**
