Output State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is the opposite of its previous value plus 1, `bc` is the opposite of its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `ac += 1` increments the value of `ac` by 1. Since `ac` was previously the opposite of its previous value (either 1 or 2), adding 1 to it will make it the opposite of its previous value plus 1. The value of `bc` remains the opposite of its previous value, and `i` remains the next character in `s`.
