Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. After each iteration, `i` takes the next character from `s`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ac` is 1 if the current value of `i` is 'A', otherwise `bc` is 1.
   - `q` remains `t`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `s`.
   - `i` will take the next character from `s` in the next iteration.
   - `ac` and `bc` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `q` remains `t`.
   - `s` will be the remaining part of the string after removing the current character `i`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the next character in `s`.
   - `s` will be the remaining part of the string after removing the current character `i`.
   - `ac` and `bc` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string, let's denote the first character of `s` as `c`. In the next iteration:
- `i` will be `c`.
- `s` will be the substring of `s` starting from the second character.
- `ac` will be 1 if `c` is 'A', otherwise `bc` will be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`ac` is 1 if the next character in `s` is 'A', otherwise `bc` is 1, `q` is `t`, and `s` is the remaining part of the string after removing the current character `i`.**
