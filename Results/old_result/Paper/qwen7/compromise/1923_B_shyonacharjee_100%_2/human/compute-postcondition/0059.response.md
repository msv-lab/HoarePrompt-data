Output State: **`bullets_used` is the sum of the health of the first and second monsters plus the health of the second monster, `can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list without the first two tuples, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `health` is the health of the next monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `2 * bullets_used + health`, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the next monster.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total_bullets_needed` to be `bullets_used + health`. Given that `bullets_used` is initially defined as the sum of the health of the first and second monsters plus the health of the second monster, `total_bullets_needed` is now calculated as `2 * bullets_used + health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
