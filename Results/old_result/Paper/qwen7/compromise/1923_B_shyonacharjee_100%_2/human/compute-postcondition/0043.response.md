Output State: **`bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True, `monsters` is a non-empty list, `pos` is the position of the first monster in the list, `health` is the health of the first monster in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster in the list, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used` + `health`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `total_bullets_needed` as the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. Since `bullets_used` is 0 initially, `total_bullets_needed` becomes the health of the first monster in the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
