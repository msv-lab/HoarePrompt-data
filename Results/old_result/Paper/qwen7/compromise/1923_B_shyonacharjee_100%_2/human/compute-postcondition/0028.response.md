Postcondition: `can_survive` remains unchanged, `bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster plus `health`, `monsters` is a list of tuples with one less element, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the next tuple, `total_bullets_needed` is twice the new `bullets_used`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
