Output State: **`can_survive` remains True, `bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list, `monsters` is an empty list, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the last monster's position, `total_bullets_needed` is the final `bullets_used` value, `x` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. This list of integers is assigned to the variable `x`. The values of the other variables (`can_survive`, `bullets_used`, `monsters`, `distance`, and `total_bullets_needed`) remain unchanged.
