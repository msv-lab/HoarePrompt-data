Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster, `monsters` is a list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and the health of the next monster, and `can_survive` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `distance = abs(pos)` simply calculates the absolute value of `pos` and assigns it to `distance`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
