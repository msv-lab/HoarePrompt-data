Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster plus `health`, `monsters` is a list of tuples with one less element, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the next tuple, `total_bullets_needed` is twice the new `bullets_used`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the `total_bullets_needed` was being calculated. The values of the other variables (`can_survive`, `bullets_used`, `monsters`, `distance`) remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify them.
