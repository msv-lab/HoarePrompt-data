Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster plus `health`, `monsters` is a list of tuples with one less element, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the next tuple, `total_bullets_needed` is twice the new `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` remains unchanged; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `distance` variable to be the absolute value of `pos`. All other variables (`bullets_used`, `monsters`, `total_bullets_needed`, and `can_survive`) remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
