Postcondition: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster, `monsters` is a list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is twice the `bullets_used` (or `bullets_used + health`), and `can_survive` remains unchanged. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
