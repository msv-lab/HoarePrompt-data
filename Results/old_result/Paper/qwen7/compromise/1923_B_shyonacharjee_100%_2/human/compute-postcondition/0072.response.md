Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all the monsters, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `pos` is undefined, `health` is undefined, `distance` is undefined, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `monsters` list based on the absolute value of their positions using the `sorted` function and a lambda function as the key. This means that `monsters` now contains tuples of (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position. The other variables remain unchanged.
