Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value of input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value of input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `_` remains unchanged and is still 0. The variable `t` is not affected by this operation and is described as an integer within the specified range.
