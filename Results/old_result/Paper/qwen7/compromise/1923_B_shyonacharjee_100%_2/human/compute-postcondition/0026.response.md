Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster plus `health`, `monsters` is a list of tuples with one less element, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the next tuple, `total_bullets_needed` is twice the new `bullets_used`.**

Explanation: The line `can_survive = False` sets the variable `can_survive` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `bullets_used`, `monsters`, `distance`, and `total_bullets_needed` remain unchanged from their initial states.
