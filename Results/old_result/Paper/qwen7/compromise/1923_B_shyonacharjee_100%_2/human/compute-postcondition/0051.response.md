Output State: **`bullets_used` is the sum of the health of the first and second monsters, `can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list without the first tuple, `pos` is the position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total_bullets_needed` to be the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
