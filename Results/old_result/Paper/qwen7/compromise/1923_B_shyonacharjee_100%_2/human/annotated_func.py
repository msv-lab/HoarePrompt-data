#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The third line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all monsters, `monsters` is an empty list, `pos` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `t` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `x` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `can_survive` will remain `False` because the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` was met at some point, causing the loop to break. The value of `bullets_used` will be the sum of the health of all the monsters since `bullets_used` is incremented by the health of each monster in each iteration. The `monsters` list becomes empty as all monsters are processed. The `pos`, `health`, and `distance` variables will hold the values of the last monster's position, health, and absolute position, respectively. The loop counter `t` will be 0 after all iterations are completed, and the lists `a`, `n`, `k`, and `x` will be empty because they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n and k, followed by two lines of integers. For each test case, it sorts a list of monsters based on their positions, calculates the total bullets used to eliminate them, and checks if the total bullets needed exceed the available bullets per position. If any test case fails this check, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs whether all monsters can be eliminated based on the given conditions.
