Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, and `results` is a list containing strings with either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. The length of the `results` list is equal to the value of `t`. For each input `n` and string `arr`, if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and includes the substring '11', the corresponding result is 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's (and does not meet the first condition), the result is 'yes'. Otherwise, the result is 'no'.
