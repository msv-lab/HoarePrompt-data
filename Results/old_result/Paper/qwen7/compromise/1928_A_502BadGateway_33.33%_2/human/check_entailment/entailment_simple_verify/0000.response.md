### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the program to understand why the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob starts with a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
- He makes a cut parallel to one of the sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles.
- He then tries to rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(a, b)` to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.
- The function `func_1(a, b)` simply checks if \(b\) is even and returns "yes" if it is, otherwise "no".

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if \(b\) is even. This is a very narrow condition and does not cover all possible scenarios where a new rectangle can be formed.
2. **Examples Provided in the Problem Statement**:
   - For \(2 \times 6\): Cutting it into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and rearranging them forms a \(3 \times 4\) rectangle. The function would return "No" because \(6\) is even.
   - For \(3 \times 2\): Cutting it into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and rearranging them forms a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle. The function would return "No" because \(2\) is even.

These examples clearly show that the function is not sufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. The function only considers the width \(b\) being even, which is not a comprehensive check.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only checks if \(b\) is even, which is insufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
