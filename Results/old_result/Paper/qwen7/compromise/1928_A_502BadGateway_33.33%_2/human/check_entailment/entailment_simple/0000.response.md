Reasoning:
The problem requires determining whether Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The solution provided checks if \(b\) is an even number. If \(b\) is even, it returns 'yes', indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle along the width \(b\) into two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - These two smaller rectangles can then be arranged to form a new rectangle of size \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle unless \(a = b\).

2. **Special Case:**
   - If \(b\) is odd, no matter how Bob cuts the rectangle, the resulting smaller rectangles will always have one dimension as odd, and thus cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle without changing the dimensions.

3. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if \(b\) is even using the condition `b % 2 == 0`.
   - If \(b\) is even, it returns 'yes'.
   - If \(b\) is odd, it returns 'no'.

Given the problem constraints and the function logic, the program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain a different rectangle.

Correctness: **True**
