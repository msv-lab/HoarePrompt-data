Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it fails to consider other cases where a rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

For example, consider the input `2 6`. According to the problem description, a 2x6 rectangle can be split into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return "No" for this case because `b % 2 == 0` is true, and it does not account for the possibility of forming a new rectangle by splitting along the length.

Another example is the input `3 2`, which can be split into two 3x1 rectangles and then rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle. The current implementation would also incorrectly return "No" for this case.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
