Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this logic is incomplete and incorrect for determining whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions \(a \times b\).

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider the following:

1. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, no other rectangle can be formed.
2. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are greater than 1, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into smaller rectangles and reassembling them.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1 and b == 1:
        print("No")
    else:
        print("Yes")
```

This corrected program checks if both dimensions are 1, in which case no other rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
