Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `lst[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list located at index `a` in the list `lst`. Since `a` is the first integer entered by the user and `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `lst[a]` will now contain the value `b` appended to it. The initial conditions for `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
