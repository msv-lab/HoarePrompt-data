Output State: **`s` is False, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to `y`, and `lst[x]` is empty.**

Explanation: The initial state is given as follows:
- `s` is `True`.
- `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user.
- `x` is equal to `y`.
- `y` is the last element of `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is now empty.

The code `s = not s` simply flips the boolean value of `s`. Since `s` was initially `True`, after executing this line, `s` becomes `False`.

All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, and `lst[x]`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is as described above.
