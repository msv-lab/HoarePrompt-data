Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the last element popped from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` now contains all elements except the last one; `x` is now equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` is updated to be equal to `y`, while `s`, `a`, `b`, `y`, and `lst[x]` retain their original states.
