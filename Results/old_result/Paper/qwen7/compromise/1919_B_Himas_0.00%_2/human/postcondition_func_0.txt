The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters '+' and '-'. For each test case, it counts the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `s`. It then prints the difference between these two counts. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
