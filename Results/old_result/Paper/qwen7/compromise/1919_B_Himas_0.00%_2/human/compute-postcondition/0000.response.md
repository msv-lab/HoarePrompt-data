Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: The loop will start with `i` set to 0 and increment `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.
   - **Expression `int(input())`**: This expression reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `i` at the beginning of each iteration. For the loop to execute, this value must be at least 1.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `s` is a string of length \(n\) consisting of characters '+' and '-'.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `int(input())`, the initial state must ensure that this value is at least 1. Given that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once (since `t` is non-zero).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` to ensure the loop executes at least once. Given that `t` is a positive integer, we can assume that the input will be valid and non-zero.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `s` is a string of length \(n\) consisting of characters '+' and '-'
- The value of `int(input())` must be at least 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `s` is a string of length \(n\) consisting of characters '+' and '-', `int(input())` must be at least 1**
