Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by three values: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 1 and 5000), and s (a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'). It returns the sum of a sequence where each element a_i is 1 if s_i is '+', and -1 if s_i is '-'.**

This means the function takes a test case with a positive integer `t` (though `t` is not used in the calculation), another positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` made up of '+' and '-' characters. Based on these inputs, it calculates the sum of a sequence where each element is either 1 or -1 depending on whether the corresponding character in `s` is '+' or '-', respectively.
