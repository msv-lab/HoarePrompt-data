You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-', where the i-th character represents a_i = 1 if s_i = '+' and a_i = -1 if s_i = '-'.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        
        e = input()
        
        P = 0
        
        M = 0
        
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        
        print(P - M)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `P` will be equal to the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` will be equal to the total number of '-' characters in `e`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `e` plus one (since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, it will be one more than the length of `e`). The variable `q` will be the last character of `e`. The variable `s` will be the input integer received before the loop started.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes running, `P` contains the count of '+' characters, `M` contains the count of '-' characters, `i` is the length of the string `e` plus one, `q` is the last character of `e`, and `s` is the integer input received at the start of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by three values: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 1 and 5000), and s (a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'). It returns the sum of a sequence where each element a_i is 1 if s_i is '+', and -1 if s_i is '-'.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
