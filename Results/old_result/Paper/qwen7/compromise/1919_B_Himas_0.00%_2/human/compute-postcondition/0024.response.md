Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input integer.
- `e` is an empty string.
- `P` is the total number of '+' characters encountered in `e`.
- `M` is the total number of '-' characters encountered in `e`.

Given that `e` is an empty string, there are no '+' or '-' characters in it. Therefore:
- `P` (the total number of '+' characters in `e`) is 0.
- `M` (the total number of '-' characters in `e`) is 0.

The expression `P - M` evaluates to `0 - 0`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
