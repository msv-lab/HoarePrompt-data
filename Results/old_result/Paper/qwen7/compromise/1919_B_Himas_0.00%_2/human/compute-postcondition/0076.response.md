Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `P` will be the total number of '+' characters in the string `e` across all inputs, and `M` will be the total number of '-' characters in the string `e` across all inputs. The variable `i` will be equal to the sum of the lengths of all strings `e` plus the number of inputs (`n`). The variable `q` will be the last character of the last string `e`. The variable `s` will be the last input integer `s` from all the inputs.

In simpler terms, `P` will count all the '+' characters from every input string, `M` will count all the '-' characters from every input string, `i` will be the total number of strings processed plus the number of inputs, `q` will be the last character of the last string processed, and `s` will be the last input integer provided.
