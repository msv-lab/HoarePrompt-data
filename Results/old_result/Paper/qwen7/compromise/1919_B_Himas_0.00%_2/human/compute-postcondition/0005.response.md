Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for q in e:`. The objects involved here are `q` and `e`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `q` is the variable that will hold each character from the string `e` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `e` is a string input by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `e`. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `e` is not an empty string.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `q` is a variable that will change with each iteration, we don't need to specify its initial value. We just need to ensure that the loop can start.
   - `e` must be a non-empty string for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `e` must be a non-empty string.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 0, `M` is 0**
