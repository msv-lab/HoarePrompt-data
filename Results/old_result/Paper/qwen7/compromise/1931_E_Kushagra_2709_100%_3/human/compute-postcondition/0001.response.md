Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9; `tot` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes `tot` to 0. Since `num` was initially a string representation of an integer within the specified range, its value remains unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `tot`, which is set to 0.
