### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the logic implemented in the functions. However, let's delve deeper into the logic to ensure its correctness.

1. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a number by iterating from the end of the string representation of the number.
   - This is essential for understanding the number of trailing zeros in each number, which affects the total length calculation.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `tot` as the total length of all numbers in the list.
   - `cntvals` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in each number, sorted in descending order.
   - The loop subtracts every other element from `tot` (starting from the largest number of trailing zeros).
   - The decision to return "Sasha" or "Anna" is based on whether `tot` is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\).

#### Detailed Analysis:

- **Trailing Zeros and Length Calculation:**
  - The function `zerocnts` correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros, which is crucial for understanding the effective length of each number after Anna's move.
  - The total length `tot` is calculated initially, but the subtraction of every other element from `tot` is questionable. This logic seems to be an attempt to simulate the game's outcome, but it may not fully capture the optimal play scenario.

- **Optimal Play Strategy:**
  - Anna's goal is to minimize the total length, while Sasha's goal is to maximize it.
  - The current implementation of `func_1` does not fully account for the optimal play strategy. Specifically, the subtraction of every other element might not accurately reflect the strategic decisions made by both players.

- **Game Outcome Determination:**
  - The condition `tot >= m + 1` is used to determine the winner. However, this condition alone might not be sufficient to guarantee the correct outcome, especially in scenarios where the optimal play involves more complex strategies.

#### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 2
  100 200 300
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - Since the numbers are 100, 200, and 300, Anna can reverse one of them to make the total length smaller. For instance, reversing 100 makes it 001, which is still 3 digits. Sasha cannot form a number greater than or equal to \(10^2\) in his next move. Thus, Anna should win.

- Actual Output:
  - Using the current logic, `func_1` would calculate the total length as 6 (3 + 3 + 0) and subtract every other element (0 in this case), resulting in `tot` being 6. Since 6 >= 2 + 1, the function returns "Sasha".

This counterexample shows that the current logic might not accurately reflect the optimal play strategy, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is partially correct but lacks a thorough analysis of the optimal play strategy. The current logic in `func_1` might not fully capture the strategic decisions made by both players, leading to potential incorrect outcomes.

**Final: False**
