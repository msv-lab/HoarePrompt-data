The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer), `negatives` (an integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It calculates a list `pos` where each element is the result of `s - 2 * s2` after removing a certain number of elements from the end of `elements`. Here, `s` is the sum of the updated `elements` list, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the updated `elements` list. After processing, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`. The variables `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged, while `elements` has its last `removals` elements removed.
