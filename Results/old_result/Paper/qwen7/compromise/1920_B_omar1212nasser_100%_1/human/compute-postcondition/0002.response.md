Output State: **`pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, `elements` is a list of integers representing the array, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `pos` list. This new element is calculated as `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. Here, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements`, and `sum(elements[-negatives:])` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the `elements` list. The value of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `s` remains unchanged from their initial states.
