Output State: **`pos` is an empty list, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers representing the array.**

The code initializes an empty list named `pos`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged from their initial state.
