Output State: `pos` is a list of integers where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` after removing `i` elements from the end of `elements` for `i` ranging from 1 to `removals`. `removals` remains unchanged, `negatives` remains unchanged, `elements` has its last `removals` elements removed, `s` is the sum of the updated `elements` list, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the updated `elements` list.
