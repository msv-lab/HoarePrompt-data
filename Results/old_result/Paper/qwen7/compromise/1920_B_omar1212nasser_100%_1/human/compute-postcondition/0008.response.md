Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer), `negatives` (an integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` for each element after removing the last `removals` elements from `elements`. The variables `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged, `elements` has its last `removals` elements removed, `s` is the sum of the updated `elements` list, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the updated `elements` list.**
