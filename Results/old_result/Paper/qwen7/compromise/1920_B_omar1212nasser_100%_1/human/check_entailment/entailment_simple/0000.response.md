### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)`.
   - The output is the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case, which is printed correctly.

2. **Function `func_2(removals, negatives, elements)`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the optimal sum of the array after Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob multiplies up to `negatives` elements by `-1`.
   - It initializes `pos` with the sum of the array minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements.
   - It iteratively updates the sum `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `s2` by removing one element at a time from the end of the array.
   - For each iteration, it calculates `s - 2 * s2` and appends it to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.

3. **Optimality Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that Alice removes the smallest elements first, and Bob multiplies the largest remaining elements by `-1` to minimize the impact on the sum.
   - The approach correctly handles the constraints and optimally balances the actions of both players.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after both players make their moves.

### Correctness:
**True**
