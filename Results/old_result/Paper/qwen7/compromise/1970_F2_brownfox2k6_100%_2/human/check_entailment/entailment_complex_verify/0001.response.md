### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`). It handles the four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') appropriately by modifying the corresponding coordinate.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated. It also prints the appropriate messages for each eliminated player, ensuring that the list is sorted alphabetically by player ID.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The provided code reads the initial state of the game from input, initializes necessary variables, and processes the game steps. However, the logic for handling the game actions (e.g., catching, throwing, scoring) is missing. The program only partially implements the required functionality.

4. **Missing Components**:
   - The program lacks the main logic to process the game actions such as catching, throwing, and scoring. It does not update the positions of players and balls correctly for these actions.
   - The program does not handle the Bludger interactions properly. For example, it does not ensure that a player is eliminated when moving into a cell containing a Bludger.
   - The program does not output the final score or the sequence of events as specified in the problem statement.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_1` and `func_2` work as intended. However, the overall structure of the program is incomplete. The program reads the initial state and processes some actions, but it fails to handle the full game logic.
   - The annotated code confirms that `func_1` correctly updates the position based on the direction, and `func_2` correctly identifies and eliminates players when they are in the same position as a Bludger.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - While the provided functions are correct and work as intended, the overall program is incomplete and does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement. It lacks the necessary logic to handle the full game mechanics, including scoring, player eliminations, and outputting the final score.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to handle the full game mechanics, including scoring, player eliminations, and outputting the final score.
