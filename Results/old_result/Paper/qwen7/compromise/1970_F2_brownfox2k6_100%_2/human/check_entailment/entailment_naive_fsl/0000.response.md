Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to handle the entire problem description. Specifically, these functions do not cover the main logic of the game, such as player movements, ball interactions, scoring, and handling the Bludger. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Player Movements and Ball Interactions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used to process the main game logic. They are not called within the context of processing the game steps, and they do not handle the movement of players, catching balls, throwing Quaffles, or scoring points.

2. **Bludger Handling**: The Bludger can eliminate players, but there is no logic to handle this in the provided functions. The Bludger's movement and impact on players are not accounted for.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The program does not include any logic to check if a player has successfully thrown the Quaffle into the opponent's goal or if a player has caught the Quaffle and moved it to the opponent's goal. Therefore, it cannot correctly determine the score or announce when a team scores.

4. **Elimination Logic**: While `func_2` attempts to handle player elimination, it is not integrated into the main game loop. The function `func_2` is not called during the game steps, and it does not handle the elimination logic correctly because it does not consider the actual game state.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
