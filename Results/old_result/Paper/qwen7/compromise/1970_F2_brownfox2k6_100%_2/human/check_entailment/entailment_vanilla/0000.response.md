### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`). It correctly adjusts the coordinates of the entity based on the movement direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if a player is in the same position as a Bludger and eliminates the player if so.
   - It iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players who are in the same position as the Bludger.
   - It appends the player's ID to the `out` list if the player is in the same position as the Bludger.
   - It then prints the elimination event for each player in the `out` list, sorted alphabetically by player ID.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The program seems to be designed to handle the movement and interactions of players and balls on the field.
   - However, the provided functions do not seem to be part of the complete solution. They are likely helper functions that would be used within a larger program to manage player movements and eliminations.
   - The problem statement requires handling the entire game, including scoring, player eliminations, and outputting the final score. The provided functions only handle a specific aspect of this (elimination due to Bludgers).

4. **Missing Components**:
   - The program is missing the main logic to process the game steps, update the positions of players and balls, check for scoring, and handle other game mechanics.
   - There is no function to process the game actions (e.g., catching, throwing, etc.).
   - The program does not read input or write output as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the incomplete nature of the provided code and the missing components required to fully implement the game logic, the given program cannot be considered correct for the problem as stated.

### Correctness:
**False**
