Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `out` is a non-empty list.
   - The first element of `out` is the third element of the original `out`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')`.
   - We need to determine the values of `t` and `p`.

Given the initial state, let's denote the original `out` list as `[a, b, c, d, e, ...]` (assuming it has at least three elements).

- The first element of `out` after some operations is the third element of the original `out`. So, if the original `out` was `[a, b, c, d, e, ...]`, then the first element of the updated `out` is `c`.

- `p` is defined as the second smallest element in the updated `out`. Since the first element of the updated `out` is `c`, `p` would be the second smallest element among the elements in the updated `out`.

However, without knowing the exact elements in the updated `out` list, we cannot determine the exact value of `p`. But we know that `t` is the first element of the updated `out`, which is `c`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **c, p, 'ELIMINATED'** (where `c` is the third element of the original `out` and `p` is the second smallest element in the updated `out`).
