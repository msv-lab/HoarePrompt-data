### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program implements the decoding logic accurately. Let's break down the key points and verify the correctness of the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It then processes each test case one by one, correctly extracting the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters Extraction and Sorting**:
     - The function `func_1` correctly extracts the unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Creating the Mapping**:
     - The function creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique characters is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character. This is done correctly by iterating over the sorted unique characters and mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart.
   - **Decoding the String**:
     - The function uses the mapping to decode the entire encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding symmetric character.

3. **Testing the Example Cases**:
   - The original assessment manually verifies the decoding process for one of the example cases (`serofedsoc`), showing that the program correctly produces the original string `codeforces`.

Given the detailed analysis and the manual verification, the program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct.
