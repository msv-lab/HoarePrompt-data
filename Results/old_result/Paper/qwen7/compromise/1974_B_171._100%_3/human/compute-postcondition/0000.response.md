Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically.**

Explanation: The code `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` creates a set from the string `encoded`, which removes duplicate characters, and then sorts these unique characters alphabetically. The length of `encoded` remains unchanged, and the set operation does not affect the original string `encoded`. Therefore, the only new variable `unique_chars` is created and contains the sorted unique characters from `encoded`.
