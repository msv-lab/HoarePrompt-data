The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns a string `decoded` which is obtained by mapping each character in `encoded` using the `char_map` dictionary, where the keys and values of `char_map` are reversed compared to their original positions in the sorted list `unique_chars`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a decoded string `decoded` by reversing the mapping of characters using a dictionary `char_map` based on the sorted unique characters.**
