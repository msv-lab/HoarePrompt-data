Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it handles the operations. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly simulate the operations as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Operation Type 1**: Appending an integer `x` to the end of the array.
2. **Operation Type 2**: Appending `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the second type of operation. Instead of appending `x` copies of the current array, it simply extends the current array with itself `x` times, which is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to keep track of the structure of the array after each operation. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        elif op_type == 2:
            # Calculate the size of the array before this operation
            current_size = len(array)
            # Append the current array value 'value' times
            array.extend([array[i % current_size] for i in range(current_size * value)])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the operations as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original function `func_1` is incorrect, and the provided solution should be marked as **False**.
