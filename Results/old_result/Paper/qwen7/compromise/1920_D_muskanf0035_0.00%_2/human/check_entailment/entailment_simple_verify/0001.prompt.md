You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an initially empty array `a`.
   - Operations can be of two types:
     - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the end of the array.
     - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer `q` queries asking for the `k-th` element of the final array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the operations and queries.
   - It initializes an empty array `array`.
   - It iterates through each operation:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the array by repeating the current array `x` times.
   - For each query, it appends the `(k-1) % len(array) + 1`-th element to the result list.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries.
   - It reads the operations and queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with the operations and queries and prints the results.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Type 1 Operation:** Correctly appends the value to the array.
- **Type 2 Operation:** Correctly extends the array by repeating the current array `x` times.
- **Query Handling:** The logic for handling queries is flawed. The modulo operation `((k - 1) % len(array))` will always return an index within the current length of the array, but it does not account for the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations.

### Example Analysis

Consider the example in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Operations: `[1 1]`, `[1 2]`, `[2 1]`, `[1 3]`, `[2 3]`
  - Queries: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 20]`
  - Final array: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Queries should return: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3]`

- **Function `func_1` Logic:**
  - After the first type 1 operation, `array = [1]`.
  - After the second type 1 operation, `array = [1, 2]`.
  - After the third type 2 operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2]`.
  - After the fourth type 1 operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - After the fifth type 2 operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

- **Query Handling:**
  - For `k = 1`, the result is `1` (correct).
  - For `k = 2`, the result is `2` (correct).
  - For `k = 3`, the result is `1` (correct).
  - For `k = 4`, the result is `2` (correct).
  - For `k = 5`, the result is `3` (correct).
  - For `k = 6`, the result is `1` (correct).
  - For `k = 14`, the result is `2` (correct).
  - For `k = 15`, the result is `3` (correct).
  - For `k = 16`, the result is `1` (correct).
  - For `k = 20`, the result is `3` (correct).

However, the function does not correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations, leading to incorrect results for large values of `k`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.
