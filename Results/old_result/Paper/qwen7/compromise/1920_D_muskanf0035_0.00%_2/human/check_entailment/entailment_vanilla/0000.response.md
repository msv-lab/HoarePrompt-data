Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an initially empty array `a`.
   - Operations can be of two types:
     - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the end of the array.
     - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer `q` queries asking for the `k-th` element of the final array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the operations and queries.
   - It initializes an empty array `array`.
   - It iterates through each operation:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the array by repeating the current array `x` times.
   - For each query, it appends the `(k-1) % len(array) + 1`-th element to the result list.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries.
   - It reads the operations and queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with the operations and queries and prints the results.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Type 1 Operation:** Correctly appends the value to the array.
- **Type 2 Operation:** Correctly extends the array by repeating the current array `x` times.
- **Query Handling:** The logic for handling queries is flawed. The modulo operation `((k - 1) % len(array))` will always return an index within the current length of the array, but it does not account for the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations.

### Example Analysis

Consider the example in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Operations: `[1 1]`, `[1 2]`, `[2 1]`, `[1 3]`, `[2 3]`
  - Queries: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 20]`
  - Final array: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Queries should return: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3]`

- **Function `func_1` Logic:**
  - After the first type 1 operation, `array = [1]`.
  - After the second type 1 operation, `array = [1, 2]`.
  - After the third type 2 operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2]`.
  - After the fourth type 1 operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - After the fifth type 2 operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

- **Query Handling:**
  - For `k = 1`, the result is `1` (correct).
  - For `k = 2`, the result is `2` (correct).
  - For `k = 3`, the result is `1` (correct).
  - For `k = 4`, the result is `2` (correct).
  - For `k = 5`, the result is `3` (correct).
  - For `k = 6`, the result is `1` (correct).
  - For `k = 14`, the result is `2` (correct).
  - For `k = 15`, the result is `3` (correct).
  - For `k = 16`, the result is `1` (correct).
  - For `k = 20`, the result is `3` (correct).

However, the function does not correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations, leading to incorrect results for large values of `k`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
