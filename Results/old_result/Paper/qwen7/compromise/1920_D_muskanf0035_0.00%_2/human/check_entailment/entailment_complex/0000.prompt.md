Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and queries is a list of positive integers representing the queries. op_type is either 1 or 2, where 1 indicates appending an integer to the array and 2 indicates appending the current array x times to itself. value is an integer when op_type is 1, and an integer indicating how many times to append the array when op_type is 2. The length of operations is equal to n, and the size of queries is equal to q.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify the `result` list at all. The only operation performed on the `array` is either appending a single element or extending the array with its own elements, which results in the `array` being identical to its initial state (an empty list) after the loop completes.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    return result
    #The program returns an empty list named result
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), operations (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers - op_type and value), and queries (a list of positive integers). Based on the op_type and value in the operations list, it either appends a single integer to an initially empty array or extends the array by repeating its contents. After processing all operations, it creates a result list by appending elements from the array based on the indices specified in the queries list, modulo the length of the array. Finally, it returns an empty list named result.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and queries is a list of q integers k_i such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after performing all n operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After executing the loop for t times, the output state will consist of t lines, each line containing the results of calling `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each iteration. The results are printed as a space-separated list of integers, corresponding to the answers for each query in the `queries` list for the respective iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of operations and queries over multiple iterations. For each iteration, it reads values for n and q, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It then calls another function `func_1` to handle these inputs and prints the results. The final state consists of t lines, each containing the answers to the queries for that iteration, printed as space-separated integers.
