### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations. Specifically, the logic for handling queries using the modulo operation `((k - 1) % len(array))` does not account for the repeated structure of the array, leading to incorrect results for large values of `k`.

Upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the provided example, let's re-evaluate the function `func_1`:

1. **Type 1 Operation:** Correctly appends the value to the array.
2. **Type 2 Operation:** Correctly extends the array by repeating the current array `x` times.
3. **Query Handling:** The issue lies in the way the queries are handled. The modulo operation `((k - 1) % len(array))` indeed returns an index within the current length of the array, but it does not correctly reflect the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations.

Let's consider the example again:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Operations: `[1 1]`, `[1 2]`, `[2 1]`, `[1 3]`, `[2 3]`
  - Queries: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 20]`
  - Final array: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Queries should return: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3]`

The function `func_1` correctly processes the operations and constructs the array as expected. However, the issue arises when handling the queries. The modulo operation `((k - 1) % len(array))` will always return an index within the current length of the array, but it does not account for the repeated structure of the array.

To fix this, we need to correctly determine the position of the `k-th` element in the final array. Given the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations, we need to trace back the operations to find the correct segment of the array that contains the `k-th` element.

### Correct Approach

Instead of directly using the modulo operation, we need to keep track of the segments of the array and their positions. This can be achieved by maintaining a record of the cumulative lengths of the array after each operation.

Here is a revised approach:

1. **Maintain a cumulative length array** to keep track of the length of the array after each operation.
2. **Determine the segment** that contains the `k-th` element by binary search on the cumulative length array.
3. **Find the exact position** within the segment.

This approach ensures that we correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations.

### Conclusion

Given the need to correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations, the original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1` as implemented does not correctly handle the queries due to the flawed use of the modulo operation.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations, leading to incorrect results for large values of `k`.
