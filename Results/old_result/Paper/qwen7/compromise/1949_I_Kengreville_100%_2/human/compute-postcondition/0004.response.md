Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `x[0]` to `x[n-1]` are all `None`, `y[0]` to `y[n-1]` are all `None`, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, and the values of `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes the `visited` list to be of length `n` and filled with `False` values. All other lists and variables retain their initial states.
