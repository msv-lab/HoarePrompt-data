Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `x[0]` to `x[n-1]` are all `None`, `y[0]` to `y[n-1]` are all `None`, and the values of `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite` remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `r` has been initialized to a list of length `n`, filled with `None` values, while all other variables and their lists remain unchanged from their initial state.
