Postcondition: **`bipartite` is False, `n` is the same value read from input, `x` is the same list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `y` is the same list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `r` is the same list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `x[0]` to `x[n-1]` are integers, `y[0] to y[n-1]` are integers, `r[0]` to `r[n-1]` are integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` (since every node will be visited at least once), `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` (set to `1` during the first visit of each component), `tot` is 0, `ok` is False**
