Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. This means `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `i` is the loop counter that starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`). If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` should start at 0 when the loop begins.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
