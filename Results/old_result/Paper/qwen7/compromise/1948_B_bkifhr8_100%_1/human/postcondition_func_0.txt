The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and then \( n \) integers. It checks if the sequence of integers can be adjusted so that for every pair of consecutive elements where the second element is smaller than the first, the first element can be updated to match the smallest possible value formed by concatenating and sorting the digits of both elements. If such adjustments can be made for all pairs, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
