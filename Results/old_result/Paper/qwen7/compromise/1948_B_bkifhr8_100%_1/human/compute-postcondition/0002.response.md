Output State: **`n` must be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `m`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) is still valid. The variable `m` now holds the value entered by the user, which is converted to an integer.
