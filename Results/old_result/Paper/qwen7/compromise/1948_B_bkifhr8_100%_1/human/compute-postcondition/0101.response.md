Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m - 1` to `0` in reverse order (i.e., `range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.
   - `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i - 1]`.
   - `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
   - `ans` is set to `False`.
   - `i` is now `i - 1` if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`; otherwise, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs in reverse, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1` if the current `i` is not `0`.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `i` is set to `i - 1` in the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

Given the above points, let's adjust the state:

- `arr[i - 1]` remains the same because it is based on the previous value of `i`.
- `arr[i]` remains the same because it is based on the previous value of `i`.
- `nums` remains the same because it is based on the values of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`.
- `ans` remains `False` because there is no information suggesting it changes within the loop head.
- `i` should be `i + 1` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i + 1`**.
