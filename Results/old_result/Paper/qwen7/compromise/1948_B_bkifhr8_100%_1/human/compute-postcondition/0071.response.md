Output State: **`i` is 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `ans` remains False; `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`; if `nums` is not sorted, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` assigns the first element of `nums` to `arr[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is equivalent to `arr[-1]`. The values of `i`, `m`, `ans`, and the condition regarding `nums` remain unchanged.
