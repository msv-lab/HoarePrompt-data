Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` (before index adjustment) concatenated with the element at index `i` in `arr`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables listed in the initial state. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
