Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `ans` remains False
   - `arr[1]` is the first element of `nums`
   - If `arr[1]` is less than the previous element (`arr[0]`), then no change is made to `ans`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i = m - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` becomes 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will decrement `i` to 0 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `m` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - The value of `ans` remains False as per the postcondition.
   - The value of `arr[1]` also remains unchanged as it is outside the loop.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 0 in the next iteration.
   - `m` remains the same (greater than or equal to 1).
   - `ans` remains False.
   - `arr[1]` remains the first element of `nums`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` remains False, and `arr[1]` is the first element of `nums`**.
