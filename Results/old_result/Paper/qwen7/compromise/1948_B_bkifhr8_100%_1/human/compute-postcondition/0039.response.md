Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `m` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is 1.**

The code `m = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `m`. The other variables (`ans`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
