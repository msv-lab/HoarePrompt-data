Postcondition: `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `nums` is sorted, no change is made to `ans` and `arr[i]` remains less than `arr[i-1]`.
