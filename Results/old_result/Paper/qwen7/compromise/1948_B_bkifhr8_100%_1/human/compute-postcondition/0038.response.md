Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(n):`. This means the loop variable is an underscore (`_`), which is typically used when the variable itself is not needed within the loop body. However, we still need to consider the range and the condition under which the loop runs.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `ans` is `False`
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\)
   - `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string
   - `i` is 0
   - `arr[i - 1]` (which corresponds to `arr[-1]`) is updated to be equal to the integer value of the last element of `arr` concatenated with the element at index `m - 1` in `arr`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `n` iterations. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will run until `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, so if `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `arr[i - 1]` will be updated based on the current value of `i`. Since `i` is now 1, `arr[i - 1]` will refer to `arr[0]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ans` remains `False`
- `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\)
- `m` remains an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `arr` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string
- `i` is now 1
- `arr[i - 1]` (which corresponds to `arr[0]`) will be updated based on the logic inside the loop, but since we are only adjusting the state, we do not need to specify the exact update here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is 1, and `arr[i - 1]` (which corresponds to `arr[0]`) is yet to be updated.**
