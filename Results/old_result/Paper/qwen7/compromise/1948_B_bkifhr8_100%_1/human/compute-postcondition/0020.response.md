Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` (before index adjustment) concatenated with the element at index `i` in `arr`.**

The code `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
