Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is now the integer representation of each digit of `arr[i-1]` concatenated with `arr[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code converts the string representation of `arr[i-1]` into a list of integers using a list comprehension.
- It then concatenates this list with the integer value of `arr[i]`.
- Since `arr[i-1]` was previously less than `arr[i-2]` (from the precondition), the new value of `arr[i]` is formed by taking each digit of `arr[i-1]` and appending the integer value of `arr[i]` at the end.
