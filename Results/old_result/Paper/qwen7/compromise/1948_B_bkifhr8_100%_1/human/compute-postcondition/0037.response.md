Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is `False`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr[i - 1]` (which corresponds to `arr[-1]`) is updated to be equal to the integer value of the last element of `arr` concatenated with the element at index `m - 1` in `arr`.

Given this, let's break down the print statement:

```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

Since `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `'NO'` because `False` corresponds to the index 0 in the list `['NO', 'YES']`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
