Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is False, `arr[1]` is `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.**

The code `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `i`, `m`, `arr[1]`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
