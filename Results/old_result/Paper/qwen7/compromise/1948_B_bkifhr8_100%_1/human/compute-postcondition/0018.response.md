Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `ans` is `False`
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
   - `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string
   - `i` is `m - 1`

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range `m - 1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition given, we know that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to `False`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `m - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` will be decremented by 1 in the next iteration.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be `m - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `ans` remains `False` unless the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met during the loop body execution.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be `m - 2`.
- `ans` remains `False` because no condition has been met yet to change it.
- `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is `m - 2`**.
