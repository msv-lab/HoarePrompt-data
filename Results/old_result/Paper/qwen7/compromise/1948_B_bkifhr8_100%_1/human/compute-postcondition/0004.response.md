Output State: **`ans` is `True`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables (`n`, `m`, or `arr`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
