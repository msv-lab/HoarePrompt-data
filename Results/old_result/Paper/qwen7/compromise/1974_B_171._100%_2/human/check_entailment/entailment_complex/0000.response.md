Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string `encoded` and correctly constructs a mapping (`char_map`) from each unique character in `encoded` to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - The mapping is done such that the first character in the sorted list maps to the last character, the second character maps to the second last character, and so on.
   - The function then uses this mapping to decode the `encoded` string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads input data, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through the input data and processing each one individually.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed out after processing all test cases.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The solution handles the constraints properly, including the maximum length of the encoded string (up to \(2 \times 10^5\)).
   - The solution correctly handles the decoding process for any valid encoded string, as per the problem statement.

Given the above points, the implementation appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
