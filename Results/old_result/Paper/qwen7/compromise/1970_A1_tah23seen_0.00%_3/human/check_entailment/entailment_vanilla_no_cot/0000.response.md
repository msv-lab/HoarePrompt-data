Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Here's why:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the prefix balance and stores it in a dictionary `d`. However, the dictionary keys are indices from 1 to `len(s)`, which means it skips the actual characters of the string when sorting.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The code sorts the dictionary items by their values (prefix balances). But since the keys are indices starting from 1, the sorted keys do not correspond to the original positions of the characters in the string. This means the resulting shuffled string will be incorrect because it doesn't preserve the original character positions.

3. **Shuffling Characters**: The code constructs the final string `ans` by directly using the sorted keys, which again does not correctly shuffle the characters according to the described method.

To fix this, you need to store both the balance and the original index of each character in the dictionary and then sort based on these two criteria. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = []
    d.append((0, 0))  # Initial balance is 0 at position 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d.append((d[-1][0] + 1, i + 1))
        else:
            d.append((d[-1][0] - 1, i + 1))
    d.pop()  # Remove the last entry as it is not needed
    d.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))  # Sort by balance, breaking ties by position
    for (_, pos) in d:
        ans += s[pos - 1]  # Use the original position to get the character
    return ans

# Example usage:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected function should now properly perform the balanced shuffle operation as described.
