Output State: **`ans` is `n`, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is adjusted, `countmins` is 1**

Explanation: The code `countmins = count - 1` updates the value of `countmins` to be `count - 1`. Given that `count` is initially 2, `countmins` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
