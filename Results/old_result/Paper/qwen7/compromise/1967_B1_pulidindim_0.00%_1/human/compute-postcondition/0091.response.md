Output State: **`ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is now `n / 2 / 3`, `g` is `n / count`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `n / count`. Given that `count` is 3, `g` becomes `n / 3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
