The variables in the loop head are `count` and `m`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `count <= m`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 3, and `m` must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`. Since `count` is currently 3, `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is at least 4.

State: **`ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 1, `g` is now `n / 2 - 1`**
