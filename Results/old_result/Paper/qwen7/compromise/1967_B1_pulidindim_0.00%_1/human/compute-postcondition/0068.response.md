Output State: **`g` is `n / count - countmins - 1`, `countmins` is `count - 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given the initial postcondition that `g` is `n / count` if `g < countmins`, the value of `g` is updated to `n / count - countmins`. The values of `countmins` and the condition for `g` remain unchanged.
