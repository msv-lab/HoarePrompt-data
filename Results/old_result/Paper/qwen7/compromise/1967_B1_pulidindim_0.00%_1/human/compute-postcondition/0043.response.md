Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 5 - 1**.

Explanation: The line `countmins = count - 1` updates the value of `countmins` from its previous value of 4 to 3 (since `count` is 2). All other variables remain unchanged.
