Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly implements the required logic.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis
The given program has a few issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs using a loop and some arithmetic operations, but it does not correctly implement the logic to check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
2. **Formula Used**: The formula used in the program does not accurately reflect the problem statement. Specifically, the variable `ans` is incremented without properly checking the condition.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- For the test case \( (n, m) = (10, 8) \):
  - The program should output the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le 10\) and \(1 \le b \le 8\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The valid pairs are: \((1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3)\), which totals 14 pairs.
  - However, the program outputs 14, which seems correct based on the provided example.

### Detailed Check
Upon closer inspection, the program seems to be counting pairs based on a different logic than the problem statement. It appears to be counting pairs where \(a \le n\) and \(a \le b\), which does not fully satisfy the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
