Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series `n / 2 - 1 / 2 + 1`, `((n / 3) - 1) / 3 + 1`, ..., `((n / m) - 1) / m + 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, and `g` is `n / m - m - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific formula and prints the result. The function ensures that the input values meet certain constraints (i.e., \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \), and the sum of \( n \) and \( m \) does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^6 \)). After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated value for each case.
