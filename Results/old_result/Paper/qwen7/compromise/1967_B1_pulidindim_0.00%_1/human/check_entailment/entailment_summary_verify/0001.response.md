### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided code. Let's re-evaluate the code and the problem statement to ensure a thorough analysis.

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment
1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`, which assumes all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid. This is incorrect because the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be checked for all pairs.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `b` starting from 2 up to `m`.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the calculation of `g` and its use in updating `ans` does not follow the required condition.

3. **Handling GCD:**
   - The code does not explicitly handle the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly addressed.

#### Re-evaluation of the Code

Let's consider a more accurate approach to solve the problem:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `ans` to 0, as we need to count the valid pairs.

2. **Loop through possible values of `b`:**
   - Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.

3. **Check each pair \((a, b)\):**
   - For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
   - Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Update `ans`:**
   - If the condition is satisfied, increment `ans`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

This code correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Final Answer

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
