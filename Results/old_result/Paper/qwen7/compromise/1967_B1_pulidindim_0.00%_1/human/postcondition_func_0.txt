The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific formula and prints the result. The function ensures that the input values meet certain constraints (i.e., \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \), and the sum of \( n \) and \( m \) does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^6 \)). After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated value for each case.
