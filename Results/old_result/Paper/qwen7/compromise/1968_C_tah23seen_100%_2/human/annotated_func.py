#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0`, `i` is now -1 (since it is decremented until it becomes less than 0).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans[0]` will contain the final computed value, and all other elements in `ans` will also be updated according to the given formula. The variable `i` will be set to -1 because the loop continues to decrement `i` until it is no longer greater than or equal to 0.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length n where each element is calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is not defined as there is no `ans[n]`. The variable `i` is set to -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It calculates a new list `ans` of length `n` where each element is determined by the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from the second last index of `ans` down to the first index. After the calculation, the function returns the list `ans`. The last element of `ans` (`ans[n-1]`) is not defined as there is no corresponding `ans[n]`.
