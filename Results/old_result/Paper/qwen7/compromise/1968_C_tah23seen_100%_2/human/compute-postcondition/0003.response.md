Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is n - 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Since `i` is initially `n - 2`, `i + 1` would be `n - 1`. The values of `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged except for the specific element `ans[i]` which is now updated. The value of `i` remains `n - 2`.
