Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `leftOne` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code `tleftOne += 1` increases `leftOne` by 1 again, making it increased by 2 in total. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
