Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `tleftZero = 0` initializes the variable `tleftZero` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged.
