Output State: **`left` is `left - 1`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these variables. The precondition that either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true is preserved.
