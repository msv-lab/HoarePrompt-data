Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s`, the character at index `right` in string `s` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1**.

The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Since the initial state of `tleftZero` was not specified, we can only say that it has been increased by 1. All other variables remain in their initial states.
