Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `rightZero` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The line `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was initially increased by 1 before this line, it is now increased by 2 in total. All other variables remain unchanged.
