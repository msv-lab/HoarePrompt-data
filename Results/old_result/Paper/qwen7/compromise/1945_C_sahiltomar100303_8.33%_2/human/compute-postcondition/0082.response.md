Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial Conditions
- The loop condition is `left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is decreased by 1.

### Loop Head Analysis
- The loop continues as long as `left > 0` and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`.

### Current State
- `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`.
- `left` has been decreased by 1 from its previous value.

### Next Iteration Requirements
- For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must still be greater than 0.
- Additionally, either `leftZero` must still be less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` must still be less than half of `n - left + 1`.

### Adjusting States
- Since `left` was decreased by 1, for the loop to continue, `left` must be greater than 0 after the decrement.
- Therefore, `left` must be at least 1 (since it was just decreased by 1).

### Final State
- We need to ensure that `left` is at least 1.
- Also, the conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion
State: **`left` must be at least 1, and (`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`)**
