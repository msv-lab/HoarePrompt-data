Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `i` is less than `n`. If `s[i]` equals '0', then `rightZero` is increased by `n - mid`. Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by `n - mid`.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` starting from `mid` up to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` will reach `n-1` after `n - mid` iterations. At this point, `rightZero` will have been incremented by the number of '0's in the second half of the string `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`), which is `n - mid` times. Similarly, `rightOne` will have been incremented by the number of '1's in the second half of the string `s`, also `n - mid` times. All other variables (`leftZero`, `leftOne`, `mid`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
