Postcondition: `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted according to the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop, and the current value of `right` is equal to `n`. Additionally, if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `tleftZero` remains unchanged; otherwise, `right` is less than `n`.
