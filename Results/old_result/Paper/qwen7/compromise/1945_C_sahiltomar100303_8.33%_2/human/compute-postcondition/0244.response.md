Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is equal to 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid`, `rightOne` is less than half of the remaining length of the string, and the current value of `s[right]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is not a valid variable name in Python, so assuming it was meant to be `rightZero`, the value of `rightZero` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
