Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now `leftZero - 1`, and either `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. The condition involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remains valid, but now `leftZero` is adjusted by the decrement. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
