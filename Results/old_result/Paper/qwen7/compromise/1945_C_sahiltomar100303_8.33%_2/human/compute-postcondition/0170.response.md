Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = mid - 1`. Therefore, the loop can execute again if `i < mid`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `leftZero` is increased by 2 if `s[i]` is '0'.
   - `leftOne` is increased by 2 if `s[i]` is not '0'.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = mid - 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `mid - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `mid`, so `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `mid`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to `mid`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is increased by 2 if `s[mid]` is '0', and `leftOne` is increased by 2 if `s[mid]` is not '0'**.
