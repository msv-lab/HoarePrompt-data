Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, and `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`. `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string, and `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the length of the string `n`. The variable `mid` will still be `n // 2`. The strings `leftZero` and `leftOne` represent the counts of '0's and '1's respectively from the start of the string up to but not including the midpoint. The variables `rightZero` and `trightZero` will hold the count of '0's from the midpoint to the end of the string, while `rightOne` and `trightOne` will hold the count of '1's from the midpoint to the end of the string.
