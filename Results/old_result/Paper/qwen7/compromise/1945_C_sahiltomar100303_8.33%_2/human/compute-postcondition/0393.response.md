Output State: `left` is `0`, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1` multiplied by 2, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1` multiplied by 2, `t` is decreased by the total number of iterations, `rightZero` and `rightOne` reflect the counts of '0's and '1's respectively from the midpoint to the end of the string, `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are unchanged, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are unchanged, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `left` will reach `0` because it decreases by `1` each iteration until it no longer satisfies the condition `left > 0`. The conditions `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` ensure that the loop continues until these conditions are no longer met, which happens when `left` reaches `0`. During each iteration, the counts of '0's (`rightZero`) and '1's (`rightOne`) in the specified range are updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
