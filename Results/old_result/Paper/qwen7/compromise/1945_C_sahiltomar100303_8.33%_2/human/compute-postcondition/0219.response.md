Postcondition: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`, or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`. If the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 2, and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
