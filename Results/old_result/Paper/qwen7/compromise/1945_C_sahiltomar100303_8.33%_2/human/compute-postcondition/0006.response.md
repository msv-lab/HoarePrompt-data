Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `rightZero` to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `mid`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
