Output State: **`leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, and (`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`).**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain the same, just with the updated value of `leftZero`. The initial conditions state that `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`. These conditions are preserved with the new value of `leftZero`.
