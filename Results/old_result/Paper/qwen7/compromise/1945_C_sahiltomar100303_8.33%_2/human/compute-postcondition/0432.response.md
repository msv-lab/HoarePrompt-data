Postcondition: `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` and is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is updated based on the number of '0's encountered from the initial `right` to the end of the string, `trightZero` is updated based on the number of '0's encountered from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right`, `trightOne` is updated based on the number of '1's encountered from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right`, `tleftOne` is updated based on the number of '1's encountered from the initial `right` to the end of the string, and `right` is equal to `n`. Additionally, the number of '1's encountered from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` is less than half the length of the substring from the start to the initial `right` plus one.
