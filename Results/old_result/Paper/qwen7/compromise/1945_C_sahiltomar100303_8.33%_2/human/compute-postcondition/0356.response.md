Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mid, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `mid`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a string.
   - `i` is `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` are updated based on the value of `s[i]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `mid` to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be updated based on the new value of `s[i]`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` will be `i + 2` (since it was `i + 1` and needs to be incremented again).
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be updated based on the new value of `s[i]`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` are updated such that if `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is increased by 1, and if `s[i]` is '1', `rightOne` is increased by 1**.
