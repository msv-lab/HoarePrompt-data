Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `leftOne` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than 0 and `leftOne` is increased by 1. The code snippet `tleftOne += 1` increments `leftOne` by 1, so `leftOne` is now increased by 2. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
