Output State: **`left` is `left - 1`, `leftZero` is adjusted according to the condition if `s[left] == '0'`, then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1, ensuring either `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`. If `s[left] != '0'`, then `leftZero` remains less than half of `left + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `left` has been decremented by 1. The conditions related to `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged from their previous states, except they now apply to the new value of `left`.
