Output State: **`leftZero` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` was '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

Explanation: The code `leftZero -= 1` decreases the value of `leftZero` by 1. The conditions involving `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and the inequalities remain unchanged because no code has modified those variables or the inequality conditions. The initial state's description about `rightZero` and `rightOne` still holds true based on the condition that `s[left - 1]` was '0' or not.
