Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`, `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `left` must be greater than 0, the condition for `left` remains unchanged. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` also remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation on `leftOne`.
