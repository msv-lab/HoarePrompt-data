Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to `trightOne`. Since `trightOne` was already 0 before the assignment, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
