To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
```

The loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. `left > 0`
2. Either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `leftMove` is 1
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `mid` remains as `n // 2`
- `s` is the input string
- `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (either decreased by 1 or unchanged)
- `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1' or unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '0')
- `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0' or unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '1')
- `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '0' or increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1')
- `left` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`
- The character at `left - 1` in `s` is either '0' or '1'

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `left > 0`: This is already true since `left` is set to `mid - 1`, and `mid` is `n // 2`.
2. `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)`:
   - `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`: This condition checks if the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` is less than half of `left + 1`.
   - `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`: This condition checks if the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string is less than half of `n - left + 1`.

For the loop to continue, either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must be true.

Since `left` is `mid - 1`, we need to ensure that either `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`.
- `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `left` is `mid - 1`, which is `n // 2 - 1`.
- `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1`.
- `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string.

Thus, the adjusted state should ensure that either `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`.

State: **`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`**
