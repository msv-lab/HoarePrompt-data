Output State: **`leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `left` must be greater than 0, `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`. The current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `left`, `rightOne`, and the value of `s[left - 1]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
