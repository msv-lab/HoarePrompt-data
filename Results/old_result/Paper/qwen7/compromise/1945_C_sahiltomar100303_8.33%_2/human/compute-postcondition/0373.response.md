Output State: **`left` is (`n // 2` plus the total number of iterations) minus 1 and `s[left - 1]` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `left` is initially set to `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations and must be greater than 0. The code `leftOne -= 1` decrements `left` by 1. Since `s[left - 1]` was not '0' before the decrement, it remains unchanged after the decrement. Therefore, the updated value of `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations minus 1, and `s[left - 1]` is still not '0'.
