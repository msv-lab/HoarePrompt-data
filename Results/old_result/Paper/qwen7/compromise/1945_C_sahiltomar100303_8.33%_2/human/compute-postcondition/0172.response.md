Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than 0 and `leftZero` is increased by 1. The code snippet `tleftZero += 1` increases the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was already increased by 1 before this line of code, it is now increased by 2 in total. Therefore, the updated condition is that `leftZero` is increased by 2. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
