Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, `rightZero` is increased by 1, and `rightOne` remains unchanged.**

The code `trightZero += 1` increases the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was already increased by 1 in the initial state, it is now increased by another 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
