Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer (n // 2), and `s[i]` is not '0'; `leftOne` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Initially, `leftOne` is 1. After executing `tleftOne += 1`, `leftOne` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
