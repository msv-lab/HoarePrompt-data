Postcondition: `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted according to the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop. If `right` equals `n`, then `tleftZero` remains unchanged if it is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, `right` is less than `n`. If `right` does not equal `n`, then the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2` if `right` is not equal to `n`; otherwise, `right` is greater than `n`.
