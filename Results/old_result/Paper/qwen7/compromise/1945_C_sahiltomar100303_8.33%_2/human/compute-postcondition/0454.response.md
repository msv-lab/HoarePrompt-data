Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.**
