Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`, or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`, the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
