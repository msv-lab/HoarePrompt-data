Output State: **`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`; `left` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`, and `rightZero` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `left`. The initial condition that `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1` still holds true, and `left` is now one less than its previous value.
