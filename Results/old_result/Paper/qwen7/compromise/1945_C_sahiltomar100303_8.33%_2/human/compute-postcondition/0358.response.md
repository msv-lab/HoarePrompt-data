Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1, `rightOne` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `i`, and `rightOne`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
