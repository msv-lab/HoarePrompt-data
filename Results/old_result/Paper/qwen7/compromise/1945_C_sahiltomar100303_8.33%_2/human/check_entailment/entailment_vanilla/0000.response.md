### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly initializes variables to keep track of counts of zeros and ones on both sides of the potential road placement.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Zeros and Ones:**
   - The function correctly counts the number of zeros (`leftZero`, `trightZero`) and ones (`leftOne`, `trightOne`) on both sides of the initial midpoint (`mid = n // 2`).

3. **Adjusting Counts:**
   - The function correctly adjusts the counts when moving the road from the initial midpoint towards the start of the array.
   - Similarly, it adjusts the counts when moving the road from the initial midpoint towards the end of the array.

4. **Finding Optimal Position:**
   - The function iteratively moves the road from the initial midpoint towards the start and end of the array, ensuring that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - It correctly handles the case where the optimal position is at the very start or end of the array.
   - The function compares the distances from the midpoint and selects the position that minimizes the absolute difference.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where the optimal position is exactly at the midpoint or near the midpoint, ensuring the correct position is selected.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
