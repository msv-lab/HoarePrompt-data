Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - It then processes each test case, reading the encoded value `lex` for each.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value into a three-letter word.
   - It uses a series of conditional checks to determine the values of the first two letters (`arr[0]` and `arr[1]`) and the third letter (`arr[2]`).

3. **Conditional Checks:**
   - If `lex < 28`, it sets `arr[0]` to 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex < 52`, it sets `arr[0]` to 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex <= 78`, it sets `arr[1]` to 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.

4. **Sorting and Output:**
   - The array `arr` is sorted.
   - The decoded letters are converted to their corresponding characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and concatenated to form the word.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. The conditions do not cover all possible ranges correctly.
   - For example, if `lex` is between 28 and 51, the current logic does not handle this case properly.

2. **Sorting Before Conversion:**
   - Sorting the array before converting the values to characters is unnecessary and incorrect. The order of the letters should be determined directly from the values without sorting.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the encoded value might be outside the expected range (3 to 78).

### Correct Approach

To correctly decode the encoded value, we need to:
- Determine the first letter by checking the range of `lex`.
- Subtract the value of the first letter from `lex` to get the remaining value.
- Repeat the process for the second letter.
- The third letter can be directly determined from the remaining value after the first two letters are accounted for.

### Revised Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the first letter
        if lex < 3:
            first_letter = 1
        elif lex < 27:
            first_letter = 1
            lex -= 1
        elif lex < 53:
            first_letter = 26
            lex -= 26
        else:
            first_letter = 26
            lex -= 26
        
        # Determine the second letter
        if lex < 3:
            second_letter = 1
        elif lex < 27:
            second_letter = 1
            lex -= 1
        elif lex < 27:
            second_letter = 26
            lex -= 26
        else:
            second_letter = 26
            lex -= 26
        
        # The third letter is simply the remaining value
        third_letter = lex
        
        # Convert to characters
        print(chr(first_letter + 96) + chr(second_letter + 96) + chr(third_letter + 96))

func()
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the original program and the need for a more accurate decoding approach, the original program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
