Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is either `lex - 27` or `lex - 26`; `arr` contains the elements 26, 26**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is updated by subtracting 26 from its current value. Since `lex` was either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26` initially, after the operation, `lex` will now be either `(lex - 1) - 26` or `(lex - 26) - 26`, which simplifies to `lex - 27` or `lex - 26`. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
