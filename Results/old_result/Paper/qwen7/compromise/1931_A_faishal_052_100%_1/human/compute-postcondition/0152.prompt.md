Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is no longer sorted in ascending order; `info` contains a list which is a copy of the original `arr`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26, and `lex` remains unchanged if it is less than 52; otherwise, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26`, and `arr` contains the element 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`, and `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` becomes either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`. If `lex` is 28 or more, `lex` remains as either `lex - 27` or `lex - 26`, and `arr` still contains the elements 26, 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
