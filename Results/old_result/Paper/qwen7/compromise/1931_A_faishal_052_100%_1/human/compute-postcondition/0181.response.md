State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96) + chr(info[0][3] + 96) + chr(info[0][4] + 96)**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop is defined by `i` in the range of `cases`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still satisfy the condition `i < cases`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `cases` is a positive integer.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Since `cases` is a positive integer, the condition `i < cases` will still hold true if `i` is 1.

5. **Adjust Other States**: The other states (`j`, `cases`, and `temp`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96) + chr(info[0][3] + 96) + chr(info[0][4] + 96)**.
