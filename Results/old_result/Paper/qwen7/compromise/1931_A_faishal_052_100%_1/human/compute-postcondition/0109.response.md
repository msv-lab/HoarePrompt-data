Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is an integer less than 28; `arr` is a list containing the element 1.**

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. The variables `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is still 0, `lex` is still an integer less than 28, and `arr` now contains the element 1.
