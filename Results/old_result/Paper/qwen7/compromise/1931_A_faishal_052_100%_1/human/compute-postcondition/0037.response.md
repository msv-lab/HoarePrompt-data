Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 52 or between -26 and 52 (inclusive); `arr` contains the elements 26, 26, and 1.**

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained the elements `26` and `26`. After appending `1`, `arr` now contains `26`, `26`, and `1`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
