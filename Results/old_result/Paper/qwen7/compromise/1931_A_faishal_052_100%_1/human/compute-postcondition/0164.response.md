Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(3)`. This means the loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to 2.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 0 (since it was the previous iteration)
   - `cases` must be a positive integer
   - `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96` + the character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96`

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 3.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was 0, so for the next iteration, `j` needs to be 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 2 because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 1.
   - `cases` remains a positive integer because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `temp` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96` + the character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96**.
