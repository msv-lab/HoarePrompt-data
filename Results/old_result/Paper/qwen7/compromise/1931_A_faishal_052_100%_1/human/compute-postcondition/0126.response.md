Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and the loop itself is defined as `for j in range(2)`. This means `j` will take values from 0 to 1.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `lex` is an integer
   - `arr` is a list
   - If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the element 1.
   - If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26, and `lex` remains unchanged if it is less than 52.
   - Otherwise, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to 1, at the end of the first iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - The loop will continue if `j` is less than 2, which it will be since `j` is now 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - The conditions for `lex` and `arr` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop itself but by the loop body, which is omitted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26, and `lex` remains unchanged if it is less than 52. Otherwise, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.**
