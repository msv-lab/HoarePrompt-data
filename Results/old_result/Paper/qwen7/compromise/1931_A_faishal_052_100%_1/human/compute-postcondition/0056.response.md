Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` which is being iterated over using `range(2)`. This means `j` will take values from 0 to 1.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since `j` is iterating from 0 to 1, the initial value of `j` should be 0 for the first iteration.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range specified by `range(2)`, i.e., `j` should be less than 2.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `j` is set to its initial value (0) and that the condition `j < 2` holds true.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `lex` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
- `info` is a list containing `[26, 26, 26]`.
- `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `k < cases`.

Since these variables (`arr`, `lex`, `info`, and `i`) are not directly involved in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j` to ensure the loop can start executing.

**State:**
**`j` is 0**
