Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `j` is currently 2.
   - `cases` is a positive integer.
   - `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96`, with each character added sequentially in the loop.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(cases)`. This means the loop will run `cases` times.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration of `j` in `range(3)`, after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the number of iterations, which is `cases`.
   - `j` will be the last value it took in the loop, which is 2.
   - `cases` remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it inside the loop.
   - `temp` will contain the concatenated string formed by adding the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96` in sequence.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cases`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 0 (the starting point of the loop).
   - `j` should be set to 0 (resetting `j` for the next iteration).
   - `cases` remains a positive integer.
   - `temp` remains the same as it was after the previous iteration.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96`, with each character added sequentially in the loop.**
