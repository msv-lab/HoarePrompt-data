Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer such that 1 <= cases <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` must be less than 2, and `lex` is either less than 52 or between 28 and 78 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the element 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `lex` is either less than 52 or between -26 and 52 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `lex` is either less than 52 or between -26 and 52 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the elements 26, 26, 26. If `lex` is less than 28, then `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the elements 26, 26, 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28, then `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` still contains the elements 26, 26, 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
