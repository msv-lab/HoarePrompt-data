Postcondition: `lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` also contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25. If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, the value of `lex` and the state of `arr` remain unchanged.
