Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` will contain the elements `[1, 26, 26, lex - 2]` or `[1, 26, 26, lex - 27]`, depending on the value of `lex` after the last iteration, and `arr` will be sorted in ascending order. `info` will be a list containing the final state of `arr` after sorting for each iteration.

This means that for each case (`i` in `range(cases)`), the loop constructs an array `arr` based on the value of `lex`, appends `lex` to `arr`, sorts `arr`, and then adds it to the `info` list. After all cases have been processed, `info` will contain a list of lists, where each inner list represents the final state of `arr` for each respective case, sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    temp = ''
    for j in range(3):
        temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
    print(temp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96`, with each character added sequentially in the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 3 (since the loop runs for `j` in `range(3)`, and `i` starts from 0, so it increments by 1 for each iteration of `j`), `j` will be 2 (the last value `j` takes in the loop), `cases` remains a positive integer as no changes were made to it within the loop, and `temp` will contain the concatenated string formed by adding the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96` in sequence.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96) + chr(info[0][3] + 96) + chr(info[0][4] + 96).

In this final output state, the variable `i` remains 0 because the loop only iterates over the `j` variable which ranges from 0 to 2. After three iterations, `j` becomes 3. The variable `cases` remains a positive integer as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `temp` contains the concatenated result of converting the elements of `info[0]` from index 0 to 4 (inclusive) to characters using the formula `chr(element + 96)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)` repeated three times.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations since `j` is in the range of 3 (0 to 2). In each iteration, `temp` is updated by appending the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96` to itself. After 3 iterations, `temp` will contain the character corresponding to `info[2][3] + 96` repeated three times. The value of `i` remains 2 because the loop does not modify `i`. `j` remains 3 as it is not modified within the loop and the loop condition is based on `j` being less than 3, which is no longer true after 3 iterations. `cases` remains a positive integer as it is not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
