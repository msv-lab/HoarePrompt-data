Output State: **`lex` is an integer; `arr` contains the element 26.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the value of `lex`. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the conditions mentioned in the initial state are still valid, but now `arr` definitely contains the element 26.
