Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`. The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to 2 (inclusive).

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` must be between 0 and 2 (inclusive)
   - `cases` must be a positive integer
   - `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range of 0 to 2.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` must be between 0 and 2, and assuming it was at its maximum value of 2 in the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be 0 (since the loop starts from 0 and increments by 1).
   - `i` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `cases` remains a positive integer.
   - `temp` will now be a string containing the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`**
