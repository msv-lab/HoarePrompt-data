Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(3):`. The variables involved here are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 3. Since `j` is currently 3, it does not satisfy the condition `j < 3`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `cases`, and `temp`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition. They remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't happen in this case) would be:

- `i` remains 2.
- `j` remains 3.
- `cases` remains a positive integer.
- `temp` remains a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)`.

However, since the loop will not execute again, the final state remains as follows:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)`**
