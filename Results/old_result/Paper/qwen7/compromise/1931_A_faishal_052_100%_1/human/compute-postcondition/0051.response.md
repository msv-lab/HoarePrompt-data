Output State: **`arr` contains the elements 26, 26, 26, sorted in ascending order, which means `arr` is [26, 26, 26], `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive)**.

The `sort()` method sorts the elements of `arr` in ascending order. Since all elements in `arr` are already 26, sorting them does not change their order. The value of `lex` remains unchanged.
