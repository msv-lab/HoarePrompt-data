Output State: **The loop executes 3 times in total, with `j` being 2. `lex` is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`. The list `arr` contains the elements [1, 26, 26, lex - 2] or [1, 26, 26, lex - 27], and `arr` is sorted; `info` is a list containing one element which is the list `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. Since `arr` is already sorted and its elements are defined based on the value of `lex`, appending it to `info` does not change the values of `j`, `lex`, or the elements of `arr`. The only new information is that `info` now contains the list `arr` as its first (and only) element.
