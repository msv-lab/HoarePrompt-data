Postcondition: `lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than 27, then `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25. If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, the value of `lex` and the state of `arr` remain unchanged.
