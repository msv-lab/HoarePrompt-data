Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 2.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `lex` is an integer.
   - `arr` is a list.
   - Depending on the value of `lex`, `arr` may contain specific elements.

Given that the loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, it means `j` can take values from 0 to 1. Since the loop has already run once (assuming `j` was 0 or 1 in the previous iteration), `j` will now be incremented to 1 or 2, respectively.

Since the loop will run for `j` in the range of 2, the loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than 2. Given that `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, `j` will be 1 at the start of the current iteration and will become 2 at the end of this iteration.

Therefore, the loop will execute one more time if `j` is still less than 2, meaning `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Now, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `lex` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to `arr`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than 27, then `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25. If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, the value of `lex` and the state of `arr` remain unchanged.**
