Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 51 or between 27 and 77 (inclusive); `arr` contains the elements 26 and 1.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 1, so its new value is one less than its original value. The conditions for `lex` being less than 52 or between 28 and 78 inclusive are adjusted accordingly. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
