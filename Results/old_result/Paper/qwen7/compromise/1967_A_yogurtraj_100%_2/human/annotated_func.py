#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of each type initially.

    #State: All variables are unchanged from their final values after the third iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then iterates through it to find the maximum value `r` that can be achieved by redistributing up to `k` units among the elements of `a`. Depending on the remaining value of `k` after redistribution, it calculates and prints the final result.
