Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` if `i` was 1, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + k // (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 4`**

Explanation: 
- The initial state is given as follows: `i` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` if `i` was 1, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, and `y` is `n - 4`.
- The code snippet updates the value of `r` to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Also, since `i` is 0, the condition `if i was 1` does not apply, so `k` remains unchanged.
- Therefore, `r` is updated to `a[0] + k // (0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `a[0] + k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
