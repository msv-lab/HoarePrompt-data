Output State: **i is 0, k is 0, rem is 0, r is a[1], y is n - 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`. However, since the loop breaks when the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met, `i` will be set to `n - 1 - y`, where `y` is the value calculated when the condition was first met. Given the final state after 3 iterations, `y` is `n - 1 - 0 = n - 1`, so `i` will be `0`.

Since the loop breaks when `k` becomes 0 or when the condition is no longer met, `k` will be 0 by the end of the loop. The variable `rem` is set to 0 whenever the loop breaks, so it remains 0. The value of `r` is set to `a[i + 1]` when the loop breaks, so `r` will be `a[1]`. The variable `y` is also set to `n - 1 - i` when the loop breaks, and since `i` is 0, `y` will be `n - 1`.
