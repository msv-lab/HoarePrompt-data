Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If the condition is true, `r` is equal to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is equal to `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is equal to `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is false, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
