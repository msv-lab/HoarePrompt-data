Output State: **`k` is either reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]` if applicable, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from `k`. The value of `r` is set to `a[i + 1]` if it was applicable before the code execution. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid.
