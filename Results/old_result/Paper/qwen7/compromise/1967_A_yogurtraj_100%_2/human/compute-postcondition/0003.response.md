Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the user input, `n` is the first integer in the sorted list, `k` is the second integer in the sorted list**.

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. After sorting, the first element of the list `a` becomes `n`, and the second element becomes `k`. All other information about the initial state remains valid.
