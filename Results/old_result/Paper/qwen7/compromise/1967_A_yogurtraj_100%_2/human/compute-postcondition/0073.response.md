Output State: **`k` is either reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `r` to the value of `a[i + 1]`. This changes the value of `r` but does not affect `k`, `i`, or `n`. The precondition that `k` is either reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` also remains valid.
