Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `r` is set to `a[2]`, and `rem` and `y` are defined as per the if part's conditions. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `i` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `rem` is 0, and `y` is `n - 4`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by the value of `(1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, and `r` is equal to `a[2]`.
