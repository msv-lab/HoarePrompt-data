Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`, which is `a[3]` since `i` is 2. The value of `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
