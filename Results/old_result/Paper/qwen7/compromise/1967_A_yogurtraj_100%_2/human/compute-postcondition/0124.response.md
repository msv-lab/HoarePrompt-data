Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` if `i` was 1, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `rem` is `k % 1`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 1`, `y` is `n - 4`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `rem` as `k % (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1. Therefore, `rem` is `k % 1`. The value of `k % 1` is always 0 for any integer `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
