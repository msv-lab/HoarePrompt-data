Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `r` is equal to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)'; `rem` is equal to `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % (i + 1)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `r` is calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The initial values of `i` and `k` are updated accordingly, and `a` is referenced in the calculation of `r`. The state of `a` and `k` remains unchanged from their previous values, but `i` and `r` are updated.
