Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by (3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3])**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to subtracting `(3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3])` from `k`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
