Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `r` is equal to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, which is already mentioned in the initial state. The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` refers to the element at the index `i` in the list `a`. The value of `k // (i + 1)` represents integer division of `k` by `i + 1`. The initial conditions that `n` is greater than `i + 1` and `i` is incremented by 1 remain valid.
