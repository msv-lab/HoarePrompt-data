Output State: **`ii` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `ii`, `n`, `k`, and the nature of `a` as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `a` is now sorted.
