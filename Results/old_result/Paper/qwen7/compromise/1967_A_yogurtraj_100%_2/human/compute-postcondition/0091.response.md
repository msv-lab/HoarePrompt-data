Given the initial state where `i` is equal to `n-1` and `k` is 0, and assuming `r`, `n`, `rem`, and `y` are other variables with no explicit values provided, we need to determine the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

Since the values of `r`, `n`, `rem`, and `y` are not explicitly stated, we cannot provide their exact numerical values. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Let's break it down:

1. `r - 1`: This is simply the value of `r` minus 1.
2. `(r - 1) * n`: This is the result of multiplying the previous expression by `n`.
3. `+ 1`: Adding 1 to the result of the previous step.
4. `+ rem`: Adding the value of `rem` to the result.
5. `+ y`: Finally, adding the value of `y` to the result.

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y
\]

Since the exact values of `r`, `n`, `rem`, and `y` are not provided, we can only express the final output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y**
