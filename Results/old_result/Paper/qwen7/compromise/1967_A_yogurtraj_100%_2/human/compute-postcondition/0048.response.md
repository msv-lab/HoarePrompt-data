Output State: **`i` is 3, `r` is either `a[4]` or `a[3] + 0` depending on the conditions, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 4`, `ii` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user, splits them by space, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The values of `i`, `r`, `k`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - 3`, which simplifies to `n - 4`. The values of `n` and `k` are now dependent on the user's input.
