Output State: **`ii` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The variable `ii` is still equal to `m` as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` as input integers, while `ii` remains equal to `m`.
