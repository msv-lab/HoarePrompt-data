You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of pairs of integers printed based on the comparison of the two numbers provided in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line of input containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\), if \(x < y\), then \(x\) and \(y\) are printed in the order \(x, y\); otherwise, they are printed in the order \(y, x\). The total number of such pairs will be equal to the value of `x`, which is the number of iterations the loop will run.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) from the user, compares them, and prints the pair in ascending order. Specifically, for each pair, if \(x < y\), it prints \(x, y\); otherwise, it prints \(y, x\). The function does not return any value; its purpose is to process and output the sorted pairs based on the given conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined.
   - It reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - A `for` loop runs `x` times, handling each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` using `input().split()`, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.

3. **Determine Minimum and Maximum:**
   - The program checks if `x` (from the current test case) is less than `y`.
   - If `x < y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

4. **Expected Output:**
   - For each test case, the expected output is the minimum value followed by the maximum value of the two integers provided.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided example input:

```
10
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `1 9`
- Expected Output: `1 9`
- Program Output: `1 9` (Correct)

#### Test Case 2:

- Expected Output: `4 8`
- Program Output: `4 8` (Correct)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `1 4`
- Expected Output: `1 4`
- Program Output: `1 4` (Correct)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `3 4`
- Expected Output: `3 4`
- Program Output: `3 4` (Correct)

#### Test Case 5:

- Program Output: `2 4` (Correct)

#### Test Case 7:
- Input: `6 9`

- Program Output: `6 9` (Correct)

#### Test Case 8:
- Input: `3 3`
- Expected Output: `3 3`
- Program Output: `3 3` (Correct)

#### Test Case 9:
- Input: `0 0`
- Expected Output: `0 0`
- Program Output: `0 0` (Correct)

#### Test Case 10:
