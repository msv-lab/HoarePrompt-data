Reasoning:
- The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case.
- The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates `t` times.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.
- It then compares `x` and `y` and prints them in ascending order.
- The logic inside the loop ensures that the smaller number is always printed first, followed by the larger number, which meets the requirement of the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
