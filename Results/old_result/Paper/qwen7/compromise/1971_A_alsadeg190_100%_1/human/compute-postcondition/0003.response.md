Output State: The output state will consist of pairs of integers printed based on the comparison of the two numbers provided in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line of input containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\), if \(x < y\), then \(x\) and \(y\) are printed in the order \(x, y\); otherwise, they are printed in the order \(y, x\). The total number of such pairs will be equal to the value of `x`, which is the number of iterations the loop will run.
