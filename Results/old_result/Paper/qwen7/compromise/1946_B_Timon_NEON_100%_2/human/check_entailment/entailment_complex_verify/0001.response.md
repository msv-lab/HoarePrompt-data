### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly computes the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is essential for ensuring the result fits within the required modulo constraint.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray, but it has significant issues:
     - **Initialization**: `new_segment` and `max_segment` are initialized, but they are not updated correctly throughout the loop.
     - **Handling Negative Elements**: The logic for handling negative elements is flawed. For example, if a negative element is encountered, it should be checked against the current `max_segment` to see if it can form a larger segment. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.
     - **Appending Segments**: The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` without ensuring they are updated correctly.
     - **Final Loop**: The final loop to determine the `total_max_segment` is problematic. It does not handle the case where the maximum segment might be the entire array or a single element.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - The function is not implemented at all, which means it cannot contribute to solving the problem.

Given these observations, the functions provided do not correctly solve the problem. The logic for finding the maximum sum subarray is incorrect, and the third function is completely missing.

However, let's re-evaluate the annotated code to see if there are any overlooked details or if the original assessment missed something.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` but does not update them correctly.
   - **Handling Negative Elements**: The logic for handling negative elements is flawed. If a negative element is encountered, it should be checked against the current `max_segment` to see if it can form a larger segment. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.
   - **Appending Segments**: The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` without ensuring they are updated correctly.
   - **Final Loop**: The final loop to determine the `total_max_segment` is problematic. It does not handle the case where the maximum segment might be the entire array or a single element.

2. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - The function is not implemented at all, which means it cannot contribute to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified that the functions provided do not correctly solve the problem. The logic for finding the maximum sum subarray is incorrect, and the third function is completely missing.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not correctly implement the required functionality.
