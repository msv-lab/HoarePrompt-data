Output State: `max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers provided, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the last segment considered before finding a new one with a potentially higher sum, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that had the highest sum at some point during the loop's execution, and `segments_variants` now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]; total_max_segment` is the segment with the highest length among all segments in `segments_variants` that has a sum greater than `total_max_segment[0]`.
