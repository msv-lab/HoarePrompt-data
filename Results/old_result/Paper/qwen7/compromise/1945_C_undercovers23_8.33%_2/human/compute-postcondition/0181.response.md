Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is either an empty list or a list containing 0 and sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `n // 2` and each element is equal to `mini`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `n` is now `n // 2`, `pk` is now `n // 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `s` is the input string, `sl` is an empty list, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `mini` is assigned the value `100000000`, which is the result of `pow(10, 8)`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
