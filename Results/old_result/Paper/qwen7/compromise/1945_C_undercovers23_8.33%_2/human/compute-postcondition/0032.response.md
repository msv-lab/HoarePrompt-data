Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `zero` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `zero` was initially 1 (which is 50% of the initial count of `zero`), after incrementing it by 1, `zero` now represents 2 instances, which is 50% of the new count (2). The percentage values for `zero` and `one` are recalculated based on the new counts.
