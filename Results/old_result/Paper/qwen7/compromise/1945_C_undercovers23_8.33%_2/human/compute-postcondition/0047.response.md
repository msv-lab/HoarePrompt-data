Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Given the initial values, `o` (which is the same as `zero`) is 1, `one` is 0, `n` is greater than 4, and `i` is 4. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ \text{one\_perc} = \math.ceil((1 - 0) * 100 / (n - 4 - 1)) = \math.ceil(100 / (n - 5)) \]

Since `n` is greater than 4, the smallest possible value for `n - 5` is greater than -1, making the fraction \( \frac{100}{n-5} \) less than 100. Therefore, `math.ceil(100 / (n - 5))` results in 0 because the numerator (100) is less than the denominator (which is at least 1 when `n` is 6). Thus, `one_perc` is 0.
