Postcondition: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(n // 2 - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(n // 2 - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted, `c1` is the same as the previous value, `n` is now `n // 2`, and `t` is decreased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `n` is even or odd, after executing the if-else block, `mini` will contain the smallest value among all `abs(n // 2 - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` will contain all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(n // 2 - elem)` value and is sorted, `c1` remains unchanged, `n` is halved, and `t` is decreased by 1.
