Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is 1, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`, and `lst` contains `[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `i + 1` will be either 1 or 2. Therefore, `lst` will contain the element `i + 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
