Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is `n // 2`; `zero` is 3; `one` is 2; `zero_perc` is 60.0; `one_perc` is 100; `lst` contains `[2, 3]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. Therefore, the list `lst` now contains the elements `[2, 3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.
