Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50.0, `one_perc` is 100, and `lst` contains `[2]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.
