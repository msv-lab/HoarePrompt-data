Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `mini` to \(10^8\), which is 100000000. This value does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state, so their values remain unchanged.
