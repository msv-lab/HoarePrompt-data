Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3, `one` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `one_perc`. The formula used is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, where `o` is not explicitly defined but assumed to be `one` from the context. Since `one` is increased by 1, let's denote the original value of `one` as `one_original`. Therefore, `one = one_original + 1`. The value of `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` is at least 2, and `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3. The value of `zero_perc` remains unchanged unless `zero` changes, and `one_perc` is now calculated based on the updated value of `one`.
