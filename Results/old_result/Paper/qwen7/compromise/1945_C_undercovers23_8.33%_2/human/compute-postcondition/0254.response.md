Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer \( n \) representing the length of a binary string \( a \), and the string \( a \) itself. It calculates the percentage of '1's and '0's in the string up to each position and identifies the positions where both percentages first reach or exceed 50%. From these positions, it selects the one closest to the middle of the string (\( n // 2 \)). If no such position exists, it returns either the start or the end of the string based on which has more than half of the characters being '1' or '0', respectively. The function outputs the selected position(s) for each test case.**
