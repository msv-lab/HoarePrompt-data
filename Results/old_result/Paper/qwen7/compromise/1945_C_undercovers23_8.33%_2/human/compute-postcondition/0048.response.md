Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 5, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, `lst` is `[5]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 4, `i + 1` equals 5. Thus, `lst` now contains the value 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
