Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ele` and `lst`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `lst` contains at least one element.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is iterating over the elements of `lst`, at the end of the previous iteration, `ele` would have taken the last element from `lst`.
   - For the next iteration, `lst` should have at least one element left (since it must contain at least one element for the loop to continue).
   - `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, where `ele` is the last element processed in the previous iteration.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `lst` must still contain at least one element, but since `ele` has taken the last element, `lst` now has one less element.
- `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, where `ele` is the last element processed in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`lst` must contain at least two elements, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**
