Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `ele`, which iterates over each element in the list `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop body**: The loop updates `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between its previous value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`.
   - `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is the next element in the list, it means that `ele` has already been processed in the previous iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `ele` will be the element after the current `ele` in the list `lst`.
   - `mini` will be updated to be the minimum of its current value (which is the result of the previous iteration) and `abs(pk - next_ele)`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `mini` remains the same as it was updated in the previous iteration.
   - `ele` changes to the next element in the list `lst`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that there must be at least one more element in the list `lst`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its previous value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`, and `lst` must have at least one more element**.
