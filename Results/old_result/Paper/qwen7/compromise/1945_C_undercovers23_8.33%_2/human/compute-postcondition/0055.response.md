Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**, `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the next element `ele` in the list `lst`. The state of `ele` being the next element in the list `lst` remains unchanged, and the value of `mini` is now adjusted based on the comparison.
