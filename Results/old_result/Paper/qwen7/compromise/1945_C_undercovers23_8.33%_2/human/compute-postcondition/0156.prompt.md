Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The value of `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`; `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` contains the element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, and `lst` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is a list containing at least one element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. If there is another element `elem` with the same difference, `final` will contain an additional `elem`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
