Output State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` is a list containing the element `elem`, and `lst` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. The variables `mini` and `pk` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `lst` remains unchanged as well. The list `final` now contains the element `elem`.
