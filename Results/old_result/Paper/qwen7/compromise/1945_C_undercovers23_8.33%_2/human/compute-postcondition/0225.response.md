Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each iteration.
   - `final` is an empty list.

3. **Understand what the loop does**: The loop iterates over each element `elem` in the list `lst`. During each iteration, `mini` is updated based on the current value of `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the current element `elem`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least one element to ensure the loop can execute.
   - The initial value of `mini` is not specified, but it will be updated during the loop. Therefore, we don't need to specify an initial value for `mini` here.
   - `final` is an empty list, and this state will be maintained throughout the loop.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `lst` must contain at least one element.
- `mini` will be updated during the loop.
- `final` remains an empty list.

Thus, the final state should be:

**State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, mini will be updated during the loop, final is an empty list**.
