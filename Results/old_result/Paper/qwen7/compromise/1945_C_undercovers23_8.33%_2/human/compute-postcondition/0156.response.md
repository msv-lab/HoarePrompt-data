Output State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is a list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `mini` will still hold the smallest difference found between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The `final` list will contain every element from `lst` that has the same absolute difference from `pk` as `mini`.
