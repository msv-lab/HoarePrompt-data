Output State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is an empty list of sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `c1` as `o * 100 // n`, where `//` denotes integer division. However, the values of `o` and `n` are not specified in the initial state, so `c1` is computed based on these unspecified values. The variables `mini` and `final` remain unchanged from their initial states.
