Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is iterating over each element in the list `lst` using the variable `ele`.

2. **Understand the loop body**: Inside the loop, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: 
   - `mini` is updated based on the current value of `ele`.
   - `pk` remains unchanged as it is not mentioned to be modified within the loop.
   - `lst` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `mini` was updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - For the next iteration, `ele` will be the next element in the list `lst`.
   - Therefore, `mini` will be updated again based on this new `ele`.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated `mini` and the next `ele` in the list.

**State:**
- `mini` is now the minimum value between its previous value and `abs(pk - ele)` (where `ele` is the current element being processed).
- `ele` will be the next element in the list `lst`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `ele` for the next iteration, we can represent it as the next element in the list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its previous value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`**
