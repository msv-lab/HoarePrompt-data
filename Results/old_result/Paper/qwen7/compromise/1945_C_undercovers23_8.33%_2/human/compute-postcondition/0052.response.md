Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `ele`, which is an element from the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `lst`. Therefore, `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust the values of `ele` directly. However, we need to ensure that `lst` contains at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `lst` contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`lst` must contain at least one element**
