Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `lst`. After all iterations, `ele` will take on each value from `lst` one by one.

3. **Initial state of `ele` and `lst`**: Since the loop will iterate over each element in `lst`, `ele` will take on the values from `lst` during each iteration. However, before the loop starts, `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Final state after all iterations**: After all iterations, `ele` will be the last element in `lst`, and `lst` will be empty since it will have been fully iterated over.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `lst` contains at least one element for the loop to start executing. The other variables (`zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `sl`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop starts or not.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `lst` must contain at least one element**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing.
