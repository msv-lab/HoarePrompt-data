Postcondition: `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains the first element of `lst` followed by `elem`, and `elem` is the second element of `lst`. This is true regardless of whether `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini` or not, as there is no else part to consider.
