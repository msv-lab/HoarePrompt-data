Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `zero` and `one`, both set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.
