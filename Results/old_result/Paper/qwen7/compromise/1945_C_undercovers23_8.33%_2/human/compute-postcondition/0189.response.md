Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `s[i]` is '0', `zero_perc` is 100**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 0, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 1 (since `s[i]` is '0'), `one` is 0 (since `s[i]` is not '0'), and `s[i]` is '0'.
- The code calculates `zero_perc` using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- Since `i` is 0, `zero` is 1, and `i + 1` is 1, the calculation becomes `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 1)`, which results in `100`.
- The value of `zero_perc` is now 100, and the other variables remain unchanged.
