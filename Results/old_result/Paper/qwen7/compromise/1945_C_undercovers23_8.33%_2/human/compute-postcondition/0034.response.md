Postcondition: `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is 50, and `one_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is incremented by 1, making it 2 if it was already 1, and `zero_perc` is set to 50. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `zero` remains 1, `one` is incremented by 1, and `zero_perc` remains 100.
