Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `range(n - 1)`, meaning `i` ranges from `0` to `n-2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1 or 2.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `zero` is either 1 or 2.
   - `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] != '0'` is met.
   - `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
   - If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 or 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 or 3.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be at least 2.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- If `i` was 1, it will now be 2.
- If `i` was 2, it will now be 3.
- `n` remains the same and must still be at least 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] != '0'` is met, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`**.
