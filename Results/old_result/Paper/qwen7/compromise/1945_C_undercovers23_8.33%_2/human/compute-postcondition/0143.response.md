Output State: **The value of `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`; `final` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `final`. The value of `mini` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst` is still stored in `mini`, and `final` is now an empty list.
