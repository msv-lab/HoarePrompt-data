Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is a list containing at least one element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. If there is another element `elem` with the same difference, `final` will contain an additional `elem`.
