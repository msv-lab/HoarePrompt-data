Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the formula `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x`, with `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all iterations, the list `b` will contain values such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the previous element `b[i-1]` and either 1 or 2, depending on whether the corresponding element `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.
