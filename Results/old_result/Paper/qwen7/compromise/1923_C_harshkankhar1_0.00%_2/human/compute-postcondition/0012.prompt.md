You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. The array c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the formula `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x`, with `x = 1` if `a[i] > 1` else `2`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop executes all iterations, `b` will contain values where each element (except the first one which is 0) is the sum of the previous element in `b` and either 1 or 2, depending on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1 or not.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer, n is an input integer, q is the number of iterations the loop has executed, a is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements from the original input list up to that index, b is a list of length n + 1 where each element (except the first one which is 0) is the sum of the previous element in b and either 1 or 2 depending on whether the corresponding element in a is greater than 1 or not, the loop has printed 'NO' for pairs (x, y) where a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or x equals y, and printed 'YES' otherwise for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases through an internal mechanism. For each test case, it takes an array `c` of length `n`, two positive integers `n` and `q`, and a series of queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It processes these inputs to determine the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` for each query and returns the results accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
