Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `x` and `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - The initial value of `cnt` is not specified, but it is determined by the first three elements of `a`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `a`.
   - The value of `cnt` is set based on the first three elements of `a` being all odd.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that the first three elements of `a` are all odd for `cnt` to be set to 1.
   - If the first three elements are not all odd, `cnt` will remain 0.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the first three elements of `a` are all odd. This ensures that the condition for setting `cnt` to 1 is met.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `a` must be a list where the first three elements are all odd integers.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`a` is a list where the first three elements are all odd integers**.
