Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `_` (which is an underscore, typically used as a throwaway variable) and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer.
   - Given the state before the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range.
   - The variable `t` is already given as a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), so no adjustment is needed for `t`.
   - The loop will execute based on the input value, which must be a positive integer.

Given the above analysis, the only thing we need to ensure is that the input value is a positive integer. Since `t` is already defined as a positive integer, we can assume that the input value will be valid.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

However, since the loop will execute based on the input value, and we need to ensure the input value is valid, we can summarize the necessary adjustments as follows:

**State:**
- The input value must be a positive integer.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **The input value must be a positive integer.**
