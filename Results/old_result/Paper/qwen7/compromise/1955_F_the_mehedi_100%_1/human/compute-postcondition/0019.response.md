Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` which iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `x` and `a`**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - The initial state of `a` is unknown, but we know that the loop will check the first three elements of `a` to determine the value of `cnt`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`.
   - We need to ensure that the first three elements of `a` are checked.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over the list `a`, the initial state of `a` should reflect that it has at least three elements, and the first three elements should be odd integers to set `cnt` to 1.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `a` must be a list with at least three elements, and the first three elements of `a` must be odd integers.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `a` is a list of integers with at least three elements, and the first three elements of `a` must be odd integers.**
