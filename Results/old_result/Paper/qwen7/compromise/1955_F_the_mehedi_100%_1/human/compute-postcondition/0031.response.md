Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. Since `a` is a list of integers entered by the user and `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, the value of `a` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is now set to 0.
