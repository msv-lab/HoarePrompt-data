Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The original state of `a` being a positive integer is no longer applicable since `a` now holds a list of integers. All other variables remain unaffected by this operation.
