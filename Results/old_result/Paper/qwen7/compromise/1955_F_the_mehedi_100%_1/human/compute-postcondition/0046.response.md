Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of four integers representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. It calculates a count based on specific conditions involving these integers and prints the result. Specifically, it increments a counter by 1 if certain conditions are met and then adds the floor division of each integer in the list by 2 to the counter. The function does not return any value but prints the final count for each test case.**
