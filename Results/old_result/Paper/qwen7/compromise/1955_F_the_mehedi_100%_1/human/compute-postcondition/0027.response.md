Output State: **`a` is a list of integers. `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.**

In natural language: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `a` remains as the original list of integers provided by the user, and `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.
