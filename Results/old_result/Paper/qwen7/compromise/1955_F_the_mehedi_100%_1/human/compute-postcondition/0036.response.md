Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**.

In this scenario, the variable `cnt` is incremented by the value of `math.floor(x / 2)`. Since the initial value of `x` is not specified, we can only say that `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
