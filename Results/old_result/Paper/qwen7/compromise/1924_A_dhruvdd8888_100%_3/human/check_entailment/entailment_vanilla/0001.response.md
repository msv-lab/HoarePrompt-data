Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1()` is defined but never called directly in the main loop. This function seems to be intended for processing each test case.
   - The function `func_1()` is called inside an infinite loop (`for _ in range(int(input())):`), which is incorrect because it should call `func_1()` once per test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the function reads `n`, `k`, and `m` and the string `s`.
   - It creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of the last `k` characters seen in `s` that belong to `us`.
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and checks if it belongs to `us`. If it does, it adds it to `win` and clears `win` when it has `k` elements, indicating that a full set of `k` characters was found.
   - If `ps` (the count of such sets) is at least `n`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string that includes one character from `us` that is not in `win`.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic Verification:**
   - The logic for checking subsequences is correct. However, the infinite loop calling `func_1()` incorrectly should be replaced with a loop that processes each test case exactly once.
   - The construction of the output string in the case of "NO" is also correct, ensuring that a valid non-subsequence string of length `n` is printed.

### Correctness Check:

Given the above analysis, the main issue is the incorrect loop in the program. The loop should process each test case exactly once, not infinitely.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        for i in us:
            if i not in win:
                print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
                break
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error due to the infinite loop. Once this is corrected, the program will work as expected. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect** due to the infinite loop.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
