Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This seems like an error since the function is not utilized.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - It reads `n`, `k`, and `m` for each test case.
   - It reads the string `s` of length `m`.

4. **Set Initialization:**
   - `us` is initialized as a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win` is a set to keep track of characters seen so far.
   - `ans` is a list to store the sequence of characters forming a valid string of length `n`.

5. **Character Processing:**
   - The program iterates through each character in `s`.
   - If the character is in `us`, it adds it to `win`.
   - If `win` has `k` unique characters, it appends the character to `ans` and resets `win`.

6. **Checking Validity:**
   - After processing the string `s`, the program checks if `ps` (the count of unique characters added to `ans`) is at least `n`.
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` using characters from `us` that were not in `win`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Function Usage:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not called in the main loop. This is incorrect as the function should be called to process each test case.

2. **Logic for Checking Subsequences:**
   - The logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s` is flawed.
   - The program only checks if `k` unique characters appear in `s` and does not ensure that all possible combinations of these characters form valid subsequences.

3. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The construction of the result string in the "NO" case is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
