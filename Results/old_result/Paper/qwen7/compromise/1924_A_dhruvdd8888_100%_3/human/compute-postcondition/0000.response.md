Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, and the values of n, k, m, and s are set based on user input.**

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are updated based on the user's input. The constraints for these variables are preserved, and the string `s` is guaranteed to be composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets with a length of `m`.
