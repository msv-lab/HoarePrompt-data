Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a list containing the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`, `ans` is a list of characters added to `win` when its size reaches `k`, and `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `win` reached size `k`. The current value of `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
