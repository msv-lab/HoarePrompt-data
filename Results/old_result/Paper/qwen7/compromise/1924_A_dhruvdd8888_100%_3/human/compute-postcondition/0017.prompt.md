You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a list containing the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`, `ans` is a list of characters added to `win` when its size reaches `k`, and `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `win` reached size `k`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES'
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a list containing the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`, `ans` is a list of characters added to `win` when its size reaches `k`, and `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `win` reached size `k`. `ps` is less than `n`
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a list containing the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`, `ans` is a list of characters added to `win` when its size reaches `k`, and `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `win` reached size `k`, `ps` is less than `n`.
    #
    #In this scenario, the loop will execute for each character in `us` (the first `k` lowercase English alphabets). The loop checks if the current character `i` is not already in `win`. If it is not, it prints the concatenation of `ans`, `i`, and a string of `'a'` characters to make the total length equal to `n`. Since the loop will terminate after processing all characters in `us`, and since `us` contains exactly `k` characters, the loop will print `k` times, each time adding one character from `us` to `ans` and then appending the necessary number of `'a'` characters to meet the length requirement `n`.
    #
    #Thus, the final state of `ans` will be a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets followed by enough `'a'` characters to make the total length `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, and `ps`) will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of constraints and conditions involving test cases (t), where for each test case, it checks if a given string (s) of length m, consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, can form a sequence of length n using only these alphabets. If such a sequence can be formed for all test cases, the function prints 'YES'.

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES'
