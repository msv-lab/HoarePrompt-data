Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \) of length \( m \) consisting of the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets. It checks if it's possible to form a sequence of length \( n \) using only the characters in \( s \). If such a sequence can be formed for all test cases, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If 'NO' is printed, it further checks which characters from the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets are missing in the sequence and appends them to the result along with the required number of 'a' characters to reach the length \( n \).**
