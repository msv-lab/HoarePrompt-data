Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list before it was removed, `b` is the integer value of the first element of the list after it was removed and the first element was an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `b`. The precondition that `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order except for the first element which is now converted to an integer and removed from the list remains valid. The value of `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list before it was removed, and since that element is now removed, `a` is still the same as the integer value of the first element of the list before removal.
