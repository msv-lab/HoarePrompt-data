State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `numCases`.
2. Determine the conditions for the loop to execute: The loop will execute if `numCases` is at least 1 (greater than or equal to 1).
3. Adjust the state: Since `numCases` is an input integer and must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `numCases` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 1 as per the `range(numCases)` function, which starts counting from 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
