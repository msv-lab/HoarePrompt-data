Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numCases` is an input integer, and the values of `t` and `n` and the numbers on the whiteboard remain unchanged
Code of the loop:
for i in range(numCases):
    numInteger = int(input())
    numbers = input().split()
    numbers.sort(reverse=False)
    suma = 0
    while numbers != []:
        a = int(numbers.pop(0))
        b = int(numbers.pop(0))
        suma += min(a, b)
    print(suma)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list until no more pairs could be formed.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `numCases` will still be greater than 0, `i` will still be 1, and `numInteger` will remain as the input integer provided initially. The `numbers` list will be empty because all elements have been processed in pairs. The variable `suma` will hold the cumulative sum of the minimum values from each pair of integers that were popped from the list during the loop's iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers popped from the `numbers` list until it became empty.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `numbers` list will be empty since all elements were processed in pairs. The variable `suma` will hold the cumulative sum of the minimum values from each pair of integers that were popped from the `numbers` list during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list of input strings, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs of integers from the original `numbers` list, with each pair's smaller number decremented by 1 before adding to `suma`.

This output state describes the final condition after the loop has executed as many times as possible (until `numbers` is empty). The loop continues to pop the first two elements from the list, find their minimum, decrement the larger one by 1, and add the result to `suma`. Once all elements are processed and the list is empty, the loop terminates, leaving `suma` as the cumulative sum of the decremented minimums of all pairs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
