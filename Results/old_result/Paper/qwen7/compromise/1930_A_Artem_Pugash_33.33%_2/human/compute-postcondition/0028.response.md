Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `suma` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the `numbers` list, `b` is the integer value of the first element in the `numbers` list after it is popped from the list.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `b`. The `numbers` list is now one element shorter, and `a` remains unchanged as it was the integer value of the first element before it was popped. All other variables remain in their initial state or are not affected by this operation.
