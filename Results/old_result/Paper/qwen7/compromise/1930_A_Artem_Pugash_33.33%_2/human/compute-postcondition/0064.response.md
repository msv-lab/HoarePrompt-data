Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each case, it reads an integer `numInteger` and a list of `2*numInteger` integers. It then sorts the list in ascending order, iterates through the list in pairs, and for each pair, it adds the smaller number to a cumulative sum `suma`. If the larger number in a pair is greater than the smaller one, it decrements the larger number by 1 before adding it to `suma`. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum `suma` for each test case.**
