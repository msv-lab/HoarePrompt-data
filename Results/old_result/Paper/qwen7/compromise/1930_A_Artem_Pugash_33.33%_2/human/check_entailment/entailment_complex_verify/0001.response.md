### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program implements the optimal strategy for solving the problem. Let's break down the key points to ensure the reasoning is sound:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the list of integers for each test case.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - Sorting the list in non-decreasing order ensures that the smallest numbers are always considered first.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The `while` loop iteratively pops the first two elements of the sorted list and adds the minimum of these two elements to the cumulative sum `suma`.

4. **Optimality:**
   - By always choosing the two smallest numbers, the program ensures that the score is maximized. This is because the smallest numbers contribute the most to the score when paired together.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The problem guarantees that there will always be an even number of integers (2n), so the last element will never be used if the list is empty at the end of the loop.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles all test cases as per the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score by always choosing the two smallest numbers in each iteration.

### Final Evaluation
