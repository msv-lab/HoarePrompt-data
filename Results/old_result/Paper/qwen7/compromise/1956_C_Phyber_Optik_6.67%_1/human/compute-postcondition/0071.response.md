Output State: **`sum` is either `3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or `3 * n + 2 * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`, `r` is 3, `j` is either `n + 3` or `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The condition for the value of `sum` remains the same, but since `sum` is now increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `sum` depends on whether `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or not. The values of `r`, `j`, `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
