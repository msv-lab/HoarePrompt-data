Output: **range(1, n + 1)**

Explanation: 
- `j` is initially set to 1.
- `n` is known but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is known but its exact value is not specified.
- `sum` is 0 but it is not relevant to the print statement.
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the range of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object so that it is printed as individual numbers separated by spaces.
