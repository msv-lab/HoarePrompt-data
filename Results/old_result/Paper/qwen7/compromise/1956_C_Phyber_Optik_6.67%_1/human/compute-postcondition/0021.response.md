Output State: **`sum` is either 0 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n or 2 * n + 3 * n, depending on whether the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n holds true; `i` is 3; `r` is 2**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` adds `i * n` to the current value of `sum`. Given the initial state, `sum` could be either `0 + n * (n + 1) // 2` or `2 * n`. In both cases, `i` remains 3 and `r` remains 2. The new value of `sum` is updated as follows:
- If `sum` was initially `0 + n * (n + 1) // 2`, then the new `sum` is `0 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n`.
- If `sum` was initially `2 * n`, then the new `sum` is `2 * n + 3 * n`.

Therefore, the final state of `sum` depends on the initial condition, while `i` and `r` remain unchanged.
