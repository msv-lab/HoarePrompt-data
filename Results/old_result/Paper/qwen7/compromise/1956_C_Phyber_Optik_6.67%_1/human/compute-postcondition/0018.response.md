Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `sum` is either \(0 + n \times (n + 1) // 2\) or \(2 \times n\), depending on whether the condition \(n \times (n + 1) // 2 > 2 \times n\) holds true.
- `i` is either 2 or 3.
- `r` is 2.

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was 2, it will become 3, and if `i` was 3, it will become 4 (but since the loop range is up to `n`, this means the loop will stop).

### Adjusting States
- **`i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1, if `i` was 2, it will now be 3. If `i` was 3, the loop will terminate.
- **`sum`**: The value of `sum` does not change based on the loop itself but rather on the condition specified outside the loop. The condition \(n \times (n + 1) // 2 > 2 \times n\) determines the initial value of `sum`.
- **`r`**: The variable `r` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop logic.

### Final State
- If `i` was 2, it becomes 3.
- If `i` was 3, the loop terminates, and `i` remains 3.

Given these points, the final state at the start of the next iteration (or the current iteration if `i` was 3) is:

State: **`sum` is either 0 + n * (n + 1) // 2 or 2 * n, depending on whether the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n holds true; `i` is 3; `r` is 2**
