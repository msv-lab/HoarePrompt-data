Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is known (but its specific value is not provided)
- `r` is known (but its specific value is not provided)
- `sum` is 0
- `j` is greater than `n`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks this sequence into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print each number in the range `1` to `n` separated by spaces.

Since `n` is known but its specific value is not provided, we cannot give a concrete list of numbers. However, we can describe the output in general terms.

Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is the known value)**
