Output State: The final value of `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` added to `i * n` for each iteration from 1 to `n`, and `r` will be set to the last value of `i` which satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If no such `i` exists, `r` will be set to the last value of `i`.

In simpler terms, `sum` accumulates the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` as long as it is greater than the current `i * n`, otherwise it adds `i * n`. The variable `r` keeps track of the largest `i` for which the condition holds true during the loop's execution. If the condition never holds, `r` will be set to the last value of `i` which means `n`.

This output state describes the final values of `sum` and `r` after the loop has completed all its iterations based on the given conditions.
