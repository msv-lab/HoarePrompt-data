Output State: **`j` remains `2 * n + 2`, `n` must still be at least 1, `r` is now `i`, `t` remains `t - n * n`, `sum` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (3) and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `2 * n + 2`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it must still be at least 1.
- The value of `r` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 3.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was previously set to `t - n * n`.
- The value of `sum` is updated based on the new value of `i` (which is 3) and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`.
