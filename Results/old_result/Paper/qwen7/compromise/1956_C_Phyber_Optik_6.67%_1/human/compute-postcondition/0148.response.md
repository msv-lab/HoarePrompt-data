To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given print statement and the initial state:

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- There are no explicit values provided for `j` or `n`.
- Therefore, `j % n` will be evaluated based on the values of `j` and `n`.

Given this, the print statement will output two parts:
1. The number `2`
2. The result of `j % n`

Since `j % n` is a modulus operation, it will return the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. Without specific values for `j` and `n`, we can only describe the result in terms of these variables.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **2, j % n**
