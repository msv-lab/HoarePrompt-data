Output State: **`j` remains `2 * n + 2`, `n` must still be at least 1, `r` will be either `3` or `0` depending on the previous value of `i`, `t` remains `t - n * n`, `sum` is updated to `sum + 3 * n`**.

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `sum` is updated to `sum + 3 * n`. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `r`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
