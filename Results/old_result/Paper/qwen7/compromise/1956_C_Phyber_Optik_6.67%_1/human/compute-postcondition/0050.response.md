Output State: The loop runs from \( j = 1 \) to \( j = n + r + 1 \). Given that the loop increments \( j \) by 1 each time, the loop will run exactly \( n + r + 1 \) times. During each iteration, if \( j \leq n \), it prints 1 followed by \( j \) and a sequence from 1 to \( n \). If \( j > n \), it prints 2 followed by \( j \mod n \) and a sequence from 1 to \( n \).

After all iterations, the values of \( j \) will be from 1 to \( n + r + 1 \). Since the loop does not modify any variables outside the loop itself (other than printing), the values of \( n \) and \( r \) remain unchanged. The variable `sum` is not used in the provided loop body, so it remains 0.

Thus, the output state after the loop completes all its iterations is:

Output State: The loop has executed \( n + r + 1 \) times, printing the specified sequences for each iteration. The values of \( n \) and \( r \) are unchanged, and `sum` is 0.
