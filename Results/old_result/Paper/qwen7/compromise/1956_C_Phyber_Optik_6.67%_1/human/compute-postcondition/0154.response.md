Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 500, and n is an integer within the range 1 to 500. Additionally, the sum of n² across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵. The function processes these test cases and returns results based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving two integers t and n, with specific constraints on their values. It processes these test cases according to certain rules and returns the appropriate results for each case.
