Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `j + 1`, which means `j` has been incremented by 1.
- `n` is known.
- `r` is known.
- `sum` remains 0 if `j + 1` is still less than or equal to `n + r`.

The `print(1, j, end=' ')` statement will print the integer 1 followed by the current value of `j` with a space as the end character.

Since `j` has been incremented by 1, the value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

Output: **1, j + 1**
