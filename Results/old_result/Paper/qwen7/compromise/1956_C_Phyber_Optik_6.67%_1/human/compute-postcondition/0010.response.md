Postcondition: `sum` is either 0 + n * (n + 1) // 2 or i * n, depending on whether the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n holds true. `i` is 1 if the if condition is met, and 2 if the else condition is met. `n` must be greater than 0, and `r` is 1 if the if condition is met, and 0 if the else condition is met.
