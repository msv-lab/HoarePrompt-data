Postcondition: `sum` is either 0 + n * (n + 1) // 2 or 2 * n, depending on whether the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n holds true; `i` is either 2 or 3; `r` is 2. If the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n holds, then `sum` is adjusted accordingly with `i` being 2. Otherwise, `sum` is adjusted with `i` being 3.
