Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is defined as `2 * n + 2`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `r` must be at least `n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `j`**:
   - Since `j = 2 * n + 2` and `n` must be at least 1, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 1.
   - If `n = 1`, then `j = 2 * 1 + 2 = 4`.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - We need to calculate `j % n`, which is `4 % 1`.
   - For any integer `a % b` where `b > 0`, if `a < b`, then `a % b = a`.
   - Therefore, `4 % 1 = 0`.

### Final Values:
- `2` is explicitly printed.
- `j % n` evaluates to `0`.

### Output:
Output: **2 0**
