Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `2 * n + 2`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `r` must be at least `n + 1`
- The condition `j <= n` is false

From the condition `j <= n` being false, we can deduce that `j > n`. Given that `j = 2 * n + 2`, it is clear that `j` is indeed greater than `n` because `2 * n + 2` will always be greater than `n` for any positive integer `n`.

Now, let's focus on the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement. This will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is at least 1, the range will start from 1 and go up to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n` printed in sequence.

Output: **1 2 ... n**
