Output State: **`sum` is either `2 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or `2 * n + 2 * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`, `r` is 3, `j` is either `n + 3` or `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
