Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `j` remains `2 * n + 2`.
   - `n` must still be at least `1`.
   - `r` is either `i` or `3` depending on the previous value of `i`.
   - `t` remains `t - n * n`.
   - `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, otherwise `sum` is updated to `sum + 3 * n`.

4. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increases by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n + 1`.
   - `n` must still be at least `1`.
   - `r` will be `3` because `i` was `n` in the previous iteration, and based on the rule, it becomes `3`.
   - `t` remains `t - n * n`.
   - `sum` is updated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. Since `i` is now `n + 1`, the condition becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (n + 1) * n`, which simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * (n + 1)`, which is false. Therefore, `sum` will be updated to `sum + 3 * n`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` remains `2 * n + 2`.
   - `n` must still be at least `1`.
   - `r` is `3`.
   - `t` remains `t - n * n`.
   - `sum` is updated to `sum + 3 * n`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 2 * n + 2, `n` must still be at least 1, `r` is 3, `t` remains t - n * n, and `sum` is updated to sum + 3 * n**.
