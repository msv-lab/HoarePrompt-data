Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `2 * n + 2`
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `r` must be at least `n + 1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + r + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `2 * n + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + r + 1`.

4. **Check the Condition:**
   - We need to check if `2 * n + 2` is less than or equal to `n + r + 1`.
   - Simplifying the inequality: `2 * n + 2 ≤ n + r + 1`.
   - This simplifies to: `n + 1 ≤ r`.

5. **Current States:**
   - Since `2 * n + 2` is always greater than `n + r + 1` (because `2 * n + 2` grows faster than `n + r + 1`), the condition `2 * n + 2 ≤ n + r + 1` will never be true unless `r` is adjusted to be at least `2 * n + 2`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - To satisfy the loop condition, `r` must be at least `2 * n + 2`.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become `2 * n + 3`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `r` must be at least `2 * n + 2`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `j` will be `2 * n + 3` in the next iteration.

**Final State:**
State: **`j` is `2 * n + 3`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` must be at least `2 * n + 2`**
