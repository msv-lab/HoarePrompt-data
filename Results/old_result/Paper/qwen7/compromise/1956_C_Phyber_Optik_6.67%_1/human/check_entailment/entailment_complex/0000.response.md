Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It then calculates the sum of the matrix based on a specific formula and prints the sum along with the number of operations required.
   - The code then prints the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated using the formula \( \text{sum} = 3n^2 + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) when \( r = 3 \).
   - This formula seems to be derived from the logic of filling the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum, likely by setting the matrix to a specific permutation pattern.
4. **Operations Description**:
   - The operations are printed in a specific format where each operation is either a row permutation or a column permutation.
   - The logic of the operations seems to be designed to fill the matrix in a manner that achieves the maximum possible sum.
5. **Final State**:
   - The final state of the variables \( j \), \( n \), and \( r \) is correctly described in the comment, indicating that \( j \) is \( 3n + 3 \), \( n \) remains unchanged, and \( r \) is set to 3 after the third iteration.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It processes the test cases, calculates the maximum sum, and prints the necessary operations to achieve that sum.

Correctness: **True**
