Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the sum of the matrix elements and the number of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. However, the logic for calculating `sum` and `r` is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly reflect the strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.

2. **Operations Description**: The program prints operations but does not follow the rules of the problem. Specifically:
   - It incorrectly calculates the number of operations (`n + r`) which should be no more than 2n.
   - The operations printed do not necessarily follow the rules of either type 1 or type 2 operations as defined in the problem statement.

3. **Permutations**: The permutations used in the operations are simply printing sequences from 1 to n, which does not align with the requirement to use permutations of integers from 1 to n.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to strategically apply the operations to fill the matrix with values that maximize the sum. The solution should involve filling the matrix in such a way that the sum is maximized within the constraints of at most 2n operations. The current implementation does not achieve this.

### Correct Approach:
- Use a combination of type 1 and type 2 operations to fill the matrix in a manner that maximizes the sum.
- Ensure that the operations are applied in a way that adheres to the constraints and achieves the maximum possible sum.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect and needs significant modifications to solve the problem as stated.
