### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates a sum based on the formula \( \text{sum} = 3 \times n \times n + n \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \).
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and some additional terms, but it does not correspond to the actual operations needed to maximize the sum of the matrix.

3. **Operations Execution:**
   - The program prints the sum and the number of operations as \( n + r \), where \( r \) is set to 3.
   - It then prints a sequence of operations, but these operations do not match the required operations to maximize the sum.

4. **Operations Description:**
   - For \( j \leq n \), it prints a Type 1 operation on row \( j \) with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
   - For \( j > n \), it prints a Type 2 operation on column \( j - n \) with the same permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

Let's verify if these operations actually maximize the sum:

- **Type 1 Operation:**
  - Setting row \( i \) to \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) results in:
    ```
    1 2 3 ... n
    1 2 3 ... n
    ...
    1 2 3 ... n
    ```
  - Sum of this matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

- **Type 2 Operation:**
  - Setting column \( i \) to \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) results in:
    ```
    1 1 1 ... 1
    2 2 2 ... 2
    3 3 3 ... 3
    ...
    n n n ... n
    ```
  - Sum of this matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

Combining both operations, the total sum is indeed \( 2 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n(n+1) \), which is maximized by these operations.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the sum and the number of operations. The correct sum for \( n \times n \) matrix should be \( n(n+1) \), and the correct number of operations should be \( 2n \).

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the sum and the number of operations. It uses a fixed pattern to calculate the sum and the number of operations, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible sum. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
