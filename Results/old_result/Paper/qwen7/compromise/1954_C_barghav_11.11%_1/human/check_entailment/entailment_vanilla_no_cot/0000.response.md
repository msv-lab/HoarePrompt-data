Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the swapping logic, particularly in the second half of the string. The conditions for swapping should be consistent throughout the loop. Specifically, the program should swap the digits in both strings if they are not already in the desired order (i.e., the digit in `a` should be greater than or equal to the digit in `b`).

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    
    # Ensure the first half of the string follows the correct order
    for i in range(len(a) // 2):
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
    
    # Ensure the second half of the string follows the correct order
    for i in range(len(a) // 2, len(a)):
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
    
    # Print the results
    print(''.join(a))
    print(''.join(b))
```

This corrected function ensures that both halves of the strings are correctly swapped according to the problem requirements.
