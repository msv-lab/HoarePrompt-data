Output State: **x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, with their characters swapped in the first half and then swapped back in the second half. a is a list of characters from x (or y), and b is a list of characters from the input provided by the user, with the same transformations applied.**

This means that for the first half of the lists `a` and `b`, the minimum and maximum characters are swapped, and for the second half, the same process is applied but the roles of minimum and maximum are reversed.
