Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - For each test case, `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` starts at 0 (since `range(int(input()))` generates numbers from 0 to `int(input())-1`).
   - The value of `int(input())` is determined by user input, but based on the given constraints, it must be an integer between 1 and 1000.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `int(input())`, which represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since `t` is the initial value that should be read from input, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and use it as the loop limit.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` (which will be used as `int(input())` in the loop).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and i is 0**
