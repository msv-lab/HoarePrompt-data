Output State: **`i` is -1, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
