Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 2] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is the sum of `bm` and the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * (-1) + bp + a[b]`, `sm` is the sum of `sm` and the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * (-1) + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is now `a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `sp` is updated to `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The code `bp = a[b]` updates the value of `bp` to be equal to `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
