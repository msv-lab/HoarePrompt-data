Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `p`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
