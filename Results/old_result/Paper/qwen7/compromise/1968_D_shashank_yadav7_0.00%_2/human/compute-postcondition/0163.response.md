Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is explicitly given as `-1`.
- `b` is defined as `p[p[b] - 1] - n + 1`. Since `b` itself is not defined yet, this expression cannot be evaluated directly. We need to know the value of `p[b]` to proceed, but we don't have enough information to determine it.
- `s` is defined as `p[p[s] - 1] - n`. Similarly, since `s` is not defined, this expression also cannot be evaluated directly.
- `bm` is defined as `n * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. Given `k = -1`, this becomes `n * max(bm, a[b] * (-1) + bp)`. Again, without knowing `b` and `bp`, this cannot be fully evaluated.
- `sm` is defined as `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + (n-1) * max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. Given `k = -1`, this becomes `a[s] * (-1) + max(a[s] * (-1) + sp, sm) + (n-1) * max(sm, a[s] * (-1) + sp)`. Without knowing `s` and `sp`, this cannot be fully evaluated.
- `sp` is defined as `a[s] * n + sp`. Again, without knowing `s` and `n`, this cannot be fully evaluated.
- `bp` is defined as `4 * a[b] * (n-1)`. Given `k = -1`, this becomes `4 * a[b] * (n-1)`. Without knowing `a[b]` and `n`, this cannot be fully evaluated.
- `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.
- `bm` is greater than `sm`.

Given the above, the only part of the code that can be evaluated is the `print` statement itself, which does not depend on any of the other variables or their values.

Output: **Bodya**
