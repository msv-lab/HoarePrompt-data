Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `t-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - Other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) remain in their initial state.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration, but its initial value is not relevant to the loop condition.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) do not affect the loop condition and remain in their initial state.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
