Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer**.

The code splits the input into four integers and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
