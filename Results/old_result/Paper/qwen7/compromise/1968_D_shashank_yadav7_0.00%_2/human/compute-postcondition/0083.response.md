Output State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sm` is increased by the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `i` is 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` to `p[b] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial postconditions.
