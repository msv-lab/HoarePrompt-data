Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`, `b` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, making it -1. All other variables retain their previous values or expressions. The conditions involving `i`, `n`, `bm`, `sm`, `b`, and the expressions for `bp` and `sp` remain unchanged from the initial state.
