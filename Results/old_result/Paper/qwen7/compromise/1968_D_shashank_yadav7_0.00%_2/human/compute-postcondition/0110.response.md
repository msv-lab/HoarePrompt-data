Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is explicitly given as `-1`.
- `b` is defined as `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`. Since the value of `p[b]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `b` without more information about the list `p`. However, we know it is derived from the list `p`.
- `s` is defined similarly as `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`. Again, without knowing the specific values in `p`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`.
- `bm` is updated with the sum of itself and the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * (-1) + bp + a[b]`.
- `sm` is updated with the sum of itself and the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * (-1) + sp`.
- `sp` is updated as `a[s] + sp`.
- `bp` is updated as `a[b] + bp`.
- `i` is `n - 1`, and `n` is greater than 0, so `i` is a positive integer.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

Given this information, the `print('Draw')` statement will simply print the string "Draw".

Output: **Draw**
