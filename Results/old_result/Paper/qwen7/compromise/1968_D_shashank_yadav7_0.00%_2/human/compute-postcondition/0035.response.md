Output State: **`i` is 0, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `k` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `k` is decreased by 1 from its previous value. All other variables retain their previous relationships and values as described in the initial state.
