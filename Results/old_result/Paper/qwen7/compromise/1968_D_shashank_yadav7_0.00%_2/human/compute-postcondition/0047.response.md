Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` equals `n`
- `k` equals 0
- `b` and `s` are updated as described
- `bm` and `sm` reflect the maximum values calculated during the last iteration
- Both `sp` and `bp` have been incremented accordingly
- `bm` is greater than `sm`

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

This statement will print the string 'Bodya' directly without referencing any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state since none of those variables are used in the print statement.

Output: **Bodya**
