Output State: **`k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`, `b` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: 
- `sm` is updated by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to itself. Since `k` is 0, `a[s] * k` is 0, so `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, sp)`.
- `b` is decreased by 1, but its exact value is not specified, so it remains as `p[p[b] - 1] - 2 - 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
