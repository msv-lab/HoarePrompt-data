Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `b` is `n` - 2, `s` is `s - 1`, `bm` and `sm` reflect the maximum values calculated during the last iteration, both `sp` and `bp` have been incremented accordingly, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` over the input string, `sp` is the value of `a[s]`.**

In this step, the value of `sp` is updated to be the value of `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
