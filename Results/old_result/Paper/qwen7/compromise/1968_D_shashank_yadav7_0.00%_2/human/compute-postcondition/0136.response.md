Output State: **`k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`, `b` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `bp` is incremented by `a[b]`. Since `b` is decreased by 1, the new value of `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions involving `bm`, `sm`, `i`, `n`, and the relationship between `bm` and `sm` also remain unchanged.
