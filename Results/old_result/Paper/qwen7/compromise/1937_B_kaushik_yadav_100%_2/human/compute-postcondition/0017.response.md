Output State: **`i` is 2; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0; `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`; `work` is set to True; `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`; `ans` is now `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Since `i` was initially 2, and no changes were made to `i`, `i` remains 2. All other variables remain unchanged except `ans`, which now includes the character at index `i` of `b`.
