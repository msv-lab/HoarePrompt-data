Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is increased by `a[i] + b[i]`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `b[i]` where `i` is either 3 or 4. Since `ans` was previously increased by `a[i]`, the new value of `ans` is now `ans + a[i] + b[i]`. The value of `i` remains either 3 or 4.
