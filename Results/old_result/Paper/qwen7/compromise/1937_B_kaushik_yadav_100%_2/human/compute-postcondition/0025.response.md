Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is the string `b[0]`, `work` is set to False.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
