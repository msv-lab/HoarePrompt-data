Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is `ans` + `a[3]`, `work` is False**

Explanation: The variable `work` is set to `False`, which does not affect the values of `i` or `ans`. The initial state of `i` is 3, and `ans` is the result of `ans + a[3]`, but since `a[3]` is not defined, `ans` remains as it was before the assignment. Therefore, `ans` is still `ans + a[3]` from the initial state.
