Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is increased by `b[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` must be either 2 or 3 initially. If `i` is 2, it gets incremented to 3, and if `i` is 3, it gets incremented to 4. In both cases, `i` ends up being either 3 or 4. The value of `ans` is increased by `b[i]`, which depends on the new value of `i`.
