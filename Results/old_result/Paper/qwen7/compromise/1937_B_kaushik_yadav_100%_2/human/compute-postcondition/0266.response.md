Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, `a` has more than 1 element. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, we continue with the execution following the if statement. If neither condition is met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
