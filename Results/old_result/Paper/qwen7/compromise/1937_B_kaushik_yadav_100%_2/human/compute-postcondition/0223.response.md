Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 5; `ans` is increased by `a[i-1]`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is either 3 or 4, and `ans` is increased by `a[i]`. After executing `i += 1`, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes either 4 or 5. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its initial state because the code does not modify `ans` directly. The updated value of `i` affects the expression `a[i]` which now becomes `a[i-1]` since `i` is incremented.
