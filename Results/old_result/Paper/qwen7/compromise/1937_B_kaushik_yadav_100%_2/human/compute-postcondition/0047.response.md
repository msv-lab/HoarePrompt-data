Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 5; `ans` is `ans` + `a[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ans` + `a[4]` if `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 3, it becomes 4, and if `i` was initially 4, it becomes 5. The value of `ans` remains unchanged according to the given conditions.
