Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem statement mentions that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is the integer input from stdin.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for _ in range(t)` will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an integer input from stdin and it is constrained to be between 1 and \(10^4\), it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop will always execute given the constraints on `t`, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. However, we need to ensure that `t` is correctly set as the integer input from stdin.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustments because the loop will always execute based on the given constraints.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (the integer input from stdin)**
