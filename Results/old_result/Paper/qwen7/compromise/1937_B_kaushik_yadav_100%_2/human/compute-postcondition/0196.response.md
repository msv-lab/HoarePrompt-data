Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is True, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[i]`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace, and `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans` initially is the first character of `a`, and `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace, `ans` will now be the first character of `a` followed by the character at index 2 of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
