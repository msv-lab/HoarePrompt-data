Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the comparison of these two binary strings for each test case.**

Note: The function processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings of length `n`. The function then compares these binary strings and returns a result for each test case.
