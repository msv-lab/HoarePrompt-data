You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of binary strings), and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` based on certain conditions comparing characters from `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the current character in `a` is greater than the next character in `a` and less than the corresponding character in `b`, it appends the character from `a`; otherwise, it appends the character from `b`. After constructing `ans`, it prints `ans` and then counts the number of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b`, printing this count as well. The function ultimately outputs the constructed string `ans` and the count of consecutive matching characters for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and count the number of such paths. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the optimal path involves taking the minimum value at each step correctly.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction**: The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string by alternating between the top and bottom rows. However, it does not always choose the minimum value at each step, which is required to ensure the lexicographically smallest string. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   4
   1101
   1100
   ```
   The correct lexicographically smallest string should be `11000`, but the program outputs `11010` because it does not correctly handle the transition from `1` to `0` in the second row.

2. **Incorrect Path Counting**: The counting mechanism is also flawed. The program increments the counter whenever it encounters a matching pair of values from the top and bottom rows. This approach does not account for the possibility of multiple valid paths leading to the same lexicographically smallest string. For instance, in the example provided in the problem statement:
   ```
   8
   00100111
   11101101
   ```
   The correct output should be `001001101` with a count of `4`. However, the program incorrectly counts the paths and outputs `1`.

To fix these issues, the program needs to properly compare and merge the values from both rows while ensuring that the lexicographically smallest string is constructed. Additionally, the path counting logic needs to be revised to accurately reflect the number of valid paths that produce the lexicographically smallest string.
