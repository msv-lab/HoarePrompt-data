Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are given, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the final concatenated string formed according to the given conditions, `counter` is the total count of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b` (or the reset value if specific conditions are met), `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `work` is `False`, `t` is the initial value provided by the user, `a` is the final input string after all iterations, and `b` is the final input string after all iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be the length of the final string `a` since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `ans` will contain the final concatenated string based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `counter` will hold the total count of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b` (or the reset value if specific conditions are met). The variable `j` will be `len(a) - 1` because the loop increments `j` until it reaches the second last character of `a`. The variable `work` will be `False` because the loop exits when the condition `a[j + 1] != b[j]` and `a[j + 1] != '0'` or `b[j] != '1'` is met. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` will retain their final values after all inputs have been processed.
