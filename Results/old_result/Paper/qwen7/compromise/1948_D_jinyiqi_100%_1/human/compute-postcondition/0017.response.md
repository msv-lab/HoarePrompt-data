Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `k` and `n - j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `k` is less than `n - j`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `j` must be at least 1
   - `count` is 0 (this variable is not directly part of the loop head)

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `k` starts from 0 and the loop increments `k` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `k` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `k` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `j` remains at least 1.
   - `count` remains 0 as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` must be at least 1, and `count` is 0**.
