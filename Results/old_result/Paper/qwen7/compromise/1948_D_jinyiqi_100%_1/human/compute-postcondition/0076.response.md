Postcondition: **`n` is `N`, `j` is `J - 1`, `N - (J - 1)` is greater than 0, the character at index `k` in string `s` is either a question mark (`?`) or the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is a question mark (`?`) or the character at index `k` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`.**
