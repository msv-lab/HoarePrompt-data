Postcondition: `count` is 1 if either the character at index `k` in string `s` is '?', or the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is '?', or the character at index `k` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`. Otherwise, `count` remains 0, `k` is 0, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.
