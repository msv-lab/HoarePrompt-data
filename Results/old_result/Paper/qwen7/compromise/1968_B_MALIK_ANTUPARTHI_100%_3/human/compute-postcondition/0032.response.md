Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is 2, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial or input states.
