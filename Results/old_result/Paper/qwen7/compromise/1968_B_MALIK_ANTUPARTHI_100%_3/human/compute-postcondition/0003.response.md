Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string**.

The code assigns the value of `input()` to `d`. Since the input is treated as a string, `d` is now a string containing the input value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
