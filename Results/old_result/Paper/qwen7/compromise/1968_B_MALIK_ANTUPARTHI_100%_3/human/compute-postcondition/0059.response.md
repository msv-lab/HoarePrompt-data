Output State: **`d` is a list, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is `j + 2 + e[j + 1:].index(d[j + 1]) + 1 + j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that `j` and `k` were part of. The values of `d`, `j`, and `k` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed, as the `break` statement does not modify these variables but rather exits the control structure they are within.
