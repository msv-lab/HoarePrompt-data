Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(b)`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `b` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `d` is an input string.
   - `e` is an input string.
   - `k` is either `e[k:].index(d[1]) + 1 + k` or 1, depending on whether `d[1]` is found in `e[k:]` or not.
   - `j` is either 2 or `b - 1` or 1, depending on whether the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is met or not.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(b)`, the value of `j` will increment by 1 each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was either 2, `b - 1`, or 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `b`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `b` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `a` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `d` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `e` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `k` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (either 2, `b - 1`, or 1).

Given that `j` must be less than `b` for the loop to continue, let's consider the possible values for `j`:

- If `j` was 2, it will become 3.
- If `j` was `b - 1`, it will become `b`.
- If `j` was 1, it will become 2.

Since `j` must be less than `b` for the loop to continue, the only valid state for the next iteration is when `j` is 2 (if it was 1) or 3 (if it was 2). However, since `j` cannot be `b` (as it would exit the loop), the only valid transition is from `j = 1` to `j = 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `a` remains the same, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is either `e[k:].index(d[1]) + 1 + k` or 1, depending on whether `d[1]` is found in `e[k:]` or not, and `j` is 2.**
