Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 1, `b` is the first integer obtained from input, `c` is the second integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, and `k` is either the index of the last character of `d` in `e` starting from `k` (if all characters of `d` are found in `e`), or the value of `j` when no more characters of `d` can be found in `e[k:]`.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts these parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to `b` and `c` respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `e`, and `k` remain unchanged.
