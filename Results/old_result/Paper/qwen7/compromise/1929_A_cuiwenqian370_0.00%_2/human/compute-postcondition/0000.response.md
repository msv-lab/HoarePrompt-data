Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial conditions for `n` and the range of values in `arr` remain unchanged, but now `arr` contains its elements sorted from smallest to largest.
