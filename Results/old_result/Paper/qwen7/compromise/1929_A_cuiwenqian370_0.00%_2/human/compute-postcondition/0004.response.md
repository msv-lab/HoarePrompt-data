Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `left` is 0
   - `right` is `n - 1`
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order
   - `new_arr` is an empty list

3. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `left <= right` must be true.
   - Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, the condition `0 <= n - 1` is always true as long as `n` is a positive integer.

4. **Check if any adjustments are necessary**:
   - Since `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, the condition `left <= right` is already satisfied for any positive integer `n`.
   - There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`left` is 0, `right` is n - 1, `arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `new_arr` is an empty list**
