Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and n varies based on user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78. For each iteration, the variable `word` is constructed according to the value of `n` and printed. The final state will consist of 100 printed words, each derived from the logic inside the loop based on the corresponding `n` value provided by the user during each iteration.
