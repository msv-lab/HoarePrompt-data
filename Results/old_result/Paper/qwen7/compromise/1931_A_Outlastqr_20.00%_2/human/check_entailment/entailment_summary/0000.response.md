Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze how it handles the encoding logic and whether it correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded value \( n \).

1. **Encoding Logic**: 
   - The program correctly identifies that for \( n > 52 \), the third character must be 'z', and the first character can be calculated as \( n - 53 \).
   - For \( n > 26 \) but \( n \leq 52 \), the second character must be 'z', and the first and second characters can be calculated as \( n - 27 \) and 'z' respectively.
   - For \( n \leq 26 \), the first two characters must be 'a', and the third character can be calculated as \( n - 3 \).

2. **Constructing the Word**:
   - The program constructs the word based on these conditions and prints it.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle all possible values of \( n \) within the specified range (3 to 78). It should ensure that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest.

Let's verify the conditions with some examples:
- For \( n = 24 \):
  - \( 24 - 3 = 21 \), so the word is 'aaa' + 'u' = 'auu'.
  - However, the correct answer is 'aav', which suggests there might be an error in the logic for constructing the word.

- For \( n = 70 \):
  - \( 70 - 53 = 17 \), so the word is 'r' + 'zz' = 'rzz'.
  - This matches the expected output.

- For \( n = 3 \):
  - \( 3 - 3 = 0 \), so the word is 'aaa' + 'a' = 'aaa'.
  - This matches the expected output.

- For \( n = 55 \):
  - \( 55 - 27 = 28 \), so the word is 'a' + 'z' + 'z' = 'azz'.
  - However, the correct answer is 'czz', which suggests there might be an error in the logic for constructing the word.

- For \( n = 48 \):
  - \( 48 - 27 = 21 \), so the word is 'a' + 'v' + 'z' = 'avz'.
  - However, the correct answer is 'auz', which suggests there might be an error in the logic for constructing the word.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly identify the lexicographically smallest word for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
