You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `T` (the number of test cases) has been fully processed. For each test case, the variable `count` holds the total number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `list0` (excluding the first and last elements) is exactly 1. Additionally, `count` is incremented once more if the difference between the first element of `list0` and 0 plus `n` minus the last element of `list0` equals 1. The final value of `count` for each test case is printed. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, and `list0` is the final sorted list for the last test case. The loop counter `i` is `x`, and `T` is reduced by `(x - 1)` for each test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n, x, and y (where y is always 0), along with a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list and adds one more if the gap between the smallest and largest elements in the list is also 1. Finally, it prints the calculated count plus (x - 2) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of chosen vertices.
   
2. **Sorting the Chosen Vertices:**
   - The chosen vertices are sorted using `list0 = sorted(list0)`. This is necessary to calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices.

3. **Calculating Gaps Between Consecutive Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices and calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices (`num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`).
   - If the gap is exactly 1, it increments the `count` variable. This is because a gap of 1 means there is a direct edge between two vertices, and we can use this to form triangles.

4. **Handling the First and Last Gaps:**
   - After the loop, the program calculates the gap between the first and last chosen vertices in the sorted list (`num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`). If this gap is exactly 1, it also increments the `count` variable.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final result is calculated as `count + x - 2`. Here, `x - 2` accounts for the initial triangles formed by the first three chosen vertices.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Gap Calculation:**
  - The logic of counting gaps between consecutive vertices is correct. A gap of 1 indicates a direct edge, which can be used to form triangles.
  
- **Handling the First and Last Gaps:**
  - The logic of handling the first and last gaps is also correct. It ensures that any remaining edges at the start and end of the chosen vertices are considered.

- **Final Calculation:**
  - The formula `count + x - 2` is correct. It accounts for the initial triangles formed by the first three chosen vertices and adds the additional triangles formed by the gaps.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It accurately counts the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

### Correctness:

**True**
