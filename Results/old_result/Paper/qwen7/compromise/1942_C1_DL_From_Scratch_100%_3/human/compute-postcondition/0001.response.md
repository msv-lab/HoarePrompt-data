Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (an underscore) and `T`. The underscore is typically used as a throwaway variable when you don't need the actual value of the iterator. However, `T` is the variable that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `T` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`. This means `T` is already defined and holds an integer value.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop depends on `T` being greater than 0, we need to ensure that `T` is set to a positive integer. Any other variables that are not part of the loop head (like the variables inside the loop body) do not need to be adjusted because they are not relevant to the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `T` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
