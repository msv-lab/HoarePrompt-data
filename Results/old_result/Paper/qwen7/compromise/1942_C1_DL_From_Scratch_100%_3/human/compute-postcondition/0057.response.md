Postcondition: `count` is between 0 and `x-1` inclusive, `i` is `x - 1`, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, and if `num` equals 1, the condition remains unchanged. If `num` does not equal 1, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no else part to alter the state.
