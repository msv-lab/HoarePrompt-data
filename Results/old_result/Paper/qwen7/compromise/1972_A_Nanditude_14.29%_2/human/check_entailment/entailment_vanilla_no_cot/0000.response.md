Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for inserting a new problem difficulty `w` when `b[j] < a[i]` is flawed. The program should delete the last element from the array `a` after inserting a new difficulty `w`, but instead, it modifies the array `a` in a way that does not maintain the non-decreasing order as required by the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop()
            a.append(b[j])
            a.sort()  # Ensure a remains sorted in non-decreasing order
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected version ensures that the array `a` is always kept in non-decreasing order and properly handles the insertion and sorting steps as required by the problem.
