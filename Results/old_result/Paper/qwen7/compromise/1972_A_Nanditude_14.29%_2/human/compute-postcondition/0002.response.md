Functionality: **The function accepts a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of existing problems and the second list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the expected difficulties. After sorting both lists in descending order, it returns a new list of two lists with the same structure but with elements sorted in descending order.**
