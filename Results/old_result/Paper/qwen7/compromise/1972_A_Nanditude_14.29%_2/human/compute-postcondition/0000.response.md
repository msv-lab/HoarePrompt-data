Output State: **The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-decreasing integers and the second list contains n non-decreasing integers, but both lists are sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The given code sorts the list `arr` in descending order. Since `arr` is a list containing two lists, each of these inner lists will be sorted in descending order as well. The outer list itself will also be sorted based on the first element of each pair (i.e., the elements from the first inner list) in descending order. However, since the elements within each inner list are already non-decreasing, sorting them in descending order will reverse their order.
