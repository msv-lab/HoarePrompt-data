Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer value of the input received.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value found among the second elements of all possible consecutive sublists of length 3 within `a`, `n - 2` is less than 1, and the variable `temp` has been used and sorted during each iteration but its final value is not relevant since the loop condition `n - 2` ensures it runs only twice.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` stays as 2, `a` remains unchanged, and `max` holds the highest value that was the second largest in any of the three-element sublists of `a`. The variable `temp` is no longer relevant as the loop condition ensures it only runs twice, and `i` has reached the value 1 by the end of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `i` being 2, `temp` being [1, 3, 3], `max` remaining as 3, `n` still being 3, and `n - 2` being 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `temp` is a sorted list of three consecutive elements starting from `a[n-5]`, `max` is the second largest element among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
