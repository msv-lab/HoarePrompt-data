Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0, `n - 2` is 1, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `max = 0` directly assigns the value 0 to the variable `max`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
