Output State: **`i` is 2, `temp` is [1, 3, 3], `max` remains as 3, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop or statement.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the flow simply continues, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
