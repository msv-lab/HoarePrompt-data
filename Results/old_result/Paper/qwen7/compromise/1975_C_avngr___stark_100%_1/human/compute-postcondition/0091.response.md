Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-2`, where `n` must be greater than 2.
- `temp` is a sorted list of three consecutive elements starting from `a[n-5]`.
- `max` is the second largest element among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the key components:

1. **`i`**: This is `n-2`, so it is the index of the second last element in the list `a` after `n` is determined.
2. **`temp`**: This is a sorted list of three consecutive elements starting from `a[n-5]`. Since `n > 2`, `n-5` is a valid index, and `temp` contains three consecutive elements from `a` starting at this index.
3. **`max`**: This is the second largest element among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`. To find this, we need to look at every set of three consecutive elements in `a` and identify the second largest element across these sets.

Given that `temp` is a sorted list of three consecutive elements, the second largest element in `temp` would be the middle element if `temp` is sorted in ascending order. Therefore, `max` is the middle element of `temp`.

Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `max`. However, we know that `max` is the second largest element among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`.

Output: **max (where max is the second largest element among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`)**
