Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array `a` consisting of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t`, `n`, and an array `a`. It processes these inputs according to specified conditions and returns a result for each test case.
