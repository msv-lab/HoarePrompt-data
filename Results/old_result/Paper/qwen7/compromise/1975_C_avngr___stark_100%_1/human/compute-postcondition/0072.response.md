Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `temp` is `[a[2], a[3], a[4]]`, `max` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string**.

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 2) and ends at index `i + 3` (which is 5). So, `temp` is set to `[a[2], a[3], a[4]]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
