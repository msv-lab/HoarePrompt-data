Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible value that the array can be made uniform through the given operations. Specifically, the program only considers the median of subarrays of length 3, which is insufficient to find the true maximum possible value.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output `4`, but the correct output should be `5`. Here's why:

- In the first step, choosing the interval `(l, r) = (3, 5)` results in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`.
- In the next step, choosing the interval `(l, r) = (3, 5)` again results in the array `[1, 2, 4, 4, 4]`.
- Finally, choosing the interval `(l, r) = (1, 5)` results in the array `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.

The program only checks subarrays of length 3, and thus it fails to recognize that the median of the entire array can be used to make the entire array uniform.
