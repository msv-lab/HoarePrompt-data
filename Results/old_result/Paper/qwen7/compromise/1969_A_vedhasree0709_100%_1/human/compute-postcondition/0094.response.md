Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `p` is `l[0]`
   - `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`
   - `j` is either 0 or 1
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `i` and `n`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than 1**
