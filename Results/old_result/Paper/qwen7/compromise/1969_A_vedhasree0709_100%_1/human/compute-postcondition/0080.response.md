Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1] - 1]`, `j` remains 1 if the condition `q == i + 1` was met within the first 3 iterations, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the previous value of `l`. The values of `i`, `p`, `q`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
