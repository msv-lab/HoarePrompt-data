Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `j`. Since `i`, `n`, and `l` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The new state introduces `j` with the value 0.
