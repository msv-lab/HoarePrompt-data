Output State: `i` is 3, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[1]`, `j` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n-1`. Since `j` was set to 1 when the condition `q == i + 1` was met on the third iteration, the loop breaks and does not continue. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be 3 (since it increments up to `n-1` but stops), `p` will be `l[2]` (the value of `l[i]` on the last iteration), `q` will be `l[1]` (the value of `l[p-1]` on the last iteration), and `j` remains 1 because the condition was met on the third iteration.
