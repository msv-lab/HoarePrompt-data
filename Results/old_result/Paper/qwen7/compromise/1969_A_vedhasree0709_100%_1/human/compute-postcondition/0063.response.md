Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `p` is `l[1]`
   - `q` is `l[0]`

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute One More Time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 2. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is such that `i <= n - 1` holds true for the next iteration.
   - The values of `p` and `q` do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[0]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
