Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is `l[0]`, which means `p` is the first element of the list `l`.
- `q` is `l[p - 1]`, which means `q` is the element at the index `p - 1` in the list `l`.

Given that the current value of `q` is equal to `i + 1`, and since `i` is 0, `q` would be `0 + 1 = 1`.

However, the print statement simply outputs the number 2, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **2**
