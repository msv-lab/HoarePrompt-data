### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the analysis further:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The current implementation of splitting digits and reinserting them into the array is flawed. Specifically, the logic for handling the insertion of digits is not correctly implemented. The program simply pops and inserts elements without ensuring the digits are placed in the correct positions.

2. **Assumption of Immediate Sorting:**
   - The program assumes that after performing the digit-splitting operation, the array will be sorted immediately. However, this is not always true because the relative order of other elements in the array may still be incorrect. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. After splitting `45` into `[4, 5]`, the array becomes `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, but this does not guarantee that the array is sorted.

3. **Lack of Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or negative numbers, which are not specified in the problem but could affect the sorting process. For instance, if an array contains a negative number, the program would not know how to handle it.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this function is called after the digit-splitting operation, which might not result in a sorted array.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Step-by-Step Execution:**
  - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
  - For each element in the array, starting from the second element, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
  - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its individual digits and attempts to insert them back into the array. However, the insertion logic is incorrect, as it simply pops and inserts elements without maintaining the correct order.

- **Example:**
  - Consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
  - The program splits `45` into `[4, 5]` and inserts them into the array, resulting in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
  - This operation does not guarantee that the array is sorted, as the relative order of other elements may still be incorrect.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - To correctly solve this problem, one would need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm that ensures the array is sorted after each digit-splitting operation. This might involve maintaining a separate data structure (e.g., a priority queue) to manage the order of elements during the digit-splitting process.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment accurately points out the flaws in the program. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
