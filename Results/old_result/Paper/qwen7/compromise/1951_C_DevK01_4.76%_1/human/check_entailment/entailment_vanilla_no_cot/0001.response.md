### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to minimize the cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days.
   - Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets, and buying `x` tickets on a day increases the price of all subsequent days by `x`.
   - We must ensure the total number of tickets bought equals `k`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The strategy should involve buying as many tickets as possible each day to minimize the overall cost.
   - The cost calculation needs to account for the increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases.

3. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `M`.
   - It sorts the list of prices `M` to facilitate the greedy approach of buying as many tickets as possible each day.
   - It calculates the number of days `q` required to buy `k` tickets (`q = ceil(k / m)`).
   - It initializes `N` as the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
   - It checks if the total number of tickets bought so far equals `k`:
     - If yes, it calculates the cost considering the initial prices and the penalty for subsequent days.
     - If no, it adjusts the cost calculation by removing the last element from `N` and recalculating the cost.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic seems to handle the constraints and examples provided.
   - The code correctly handles edge cases like buying all tickets in a single day or spreading out the purchases over multiple days.
   - The cost calculation appears to be correct, considering both the initial prices and the penalties for subsequent days.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying `k` tickets under the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
