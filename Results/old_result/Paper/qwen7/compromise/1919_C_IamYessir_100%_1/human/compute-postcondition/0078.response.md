Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 1, `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. The value of `x` is updated based on the last element of `a`, which could be `lit[0]` or `x` itself. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
