Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists. If `x` equals `y`, then `a` is updated to contain `lit[i]` and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` has an additional element at index len(`b`). In all other cases, `a` remains unchanged and `b` remains unchanged.**
