Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are both lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + (2 if `lit[i] > y` else 3), `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is a specific value from `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is float('inf'), `y` is float('inf') if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `lit[i] > y`, then `a` is updated to contain the element at index `i` of `lit`, and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` has an additional element at index len(`b`).**
