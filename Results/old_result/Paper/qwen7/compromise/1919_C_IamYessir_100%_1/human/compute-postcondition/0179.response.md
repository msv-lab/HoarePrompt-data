Output State: **`i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `a` and `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `lit` remain unchanged from the initial state.
