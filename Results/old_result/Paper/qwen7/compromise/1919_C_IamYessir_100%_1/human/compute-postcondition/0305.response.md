Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(b)` is greater than 1.
   - `s` is 1 (though `s` is not directly involved in the loop head).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(b)`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `len(b)` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `s` is not directly involved in the loop head and its value does not change based on the loop condition alone.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `len(b)` remains greater than 1.
   - `s` remains 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `len(b)` is greater than 1, and `s` is 1**.
