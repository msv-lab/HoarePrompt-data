Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 4`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the last element of list `b` is now stored in `y`.
