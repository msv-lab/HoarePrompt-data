Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are both lists. If `x` >= `lit[i]`, then `a` is updated to contain `lit[i]`, and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` has an additional element at index len(`b`).**
