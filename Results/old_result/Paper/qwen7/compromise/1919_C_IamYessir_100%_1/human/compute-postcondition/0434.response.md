Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list where the last element is either `float('inf')` or the original last element of the list `a`; `b` is a list with two elements where the last element is `b[1]` and the first element is `b[1]` (which was `lit[i]`); and `y` is `b[1]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 2, `lit[i]` refers to `lit[2]`. Since `b` is a list with two elements initially, appending `lit[2]` to `b` will make the last element of `b` equal to `lit[2]`, which is also `b[1]`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
