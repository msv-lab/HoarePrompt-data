Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty); `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
