Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `a.append(lit[0])` is executed, appending the first element of `lit` to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
