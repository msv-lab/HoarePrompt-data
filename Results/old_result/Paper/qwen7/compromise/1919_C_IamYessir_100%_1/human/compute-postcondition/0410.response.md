Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[1]`, `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 1, `lit[1]` is appended to `a`. Since `a` was initially either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, after appending `lit[1]`, `a` becomes a non-empty list. The last element of `a` is now `lit[1]`. The values of `n`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
