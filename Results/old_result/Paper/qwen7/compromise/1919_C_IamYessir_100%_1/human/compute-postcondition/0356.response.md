Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[0]` and `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). The current value of `x` is greater than `y`, unless `(x >= lit[0] and lit[0] > y)` is true, in which case `x` remains unchanged and `x > y` still holds.
