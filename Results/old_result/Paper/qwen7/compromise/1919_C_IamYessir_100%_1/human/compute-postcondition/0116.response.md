Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 3, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is either `lit[0]` or `x`) or infinity, `y` is `b[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the value of the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific value for `b`, so `y` simply takes the value of `b[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
