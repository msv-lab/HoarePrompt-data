Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `b` is `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is initially 1, after executing this line, `i` is incremented to 2 (since list indices start from 0), and `b` now contains one additional element which is `lit[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
