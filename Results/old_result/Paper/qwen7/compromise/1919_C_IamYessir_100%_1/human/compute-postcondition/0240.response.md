Output State: **`a` and `b` are both lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is a specific value from `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is float('inf'), `y` is float('inf').**

Explanation: The line `y = float('inf')` assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This changes the value of `y` from its previous state (either positive infinity or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty) to `float('inf')`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
