Output State: **`a` is a list with the last element updated to `lit[i]`, `b` is unchanged, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is a specific value from `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is float('inf'), `y` is float('inf') if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is defined as `len(b) + 2`, `i` remains unchanged because the length of `b` does not affect its value. All other variables remain in their original state as they are not affected by the code snippet.
