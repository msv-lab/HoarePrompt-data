Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 2, and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, then `a`'s last element is set to `lit[1]`. If `x` is less than `lit[1]`, then `a`'s last element remains as `lit[0]`. Additionally, if `b` is an empty list, `y` remains positive infinity (`float('inf')`). Otherwise, if `y` is positive infinity, it remains unchanged. If `y` is not positive infinity and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `lit[1]`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.
