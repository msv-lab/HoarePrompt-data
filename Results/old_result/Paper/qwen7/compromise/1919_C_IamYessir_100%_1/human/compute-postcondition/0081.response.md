Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 1, `y` is positive infinity (`float('inf')`)**.

The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This changes the value of `y` from its previous state to positive infinity. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
