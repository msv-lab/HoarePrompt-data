Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is now a list with its last element equal to `lit[1]`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
