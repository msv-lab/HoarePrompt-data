Output State: **`cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `cp = 0` initializes the variable `cp` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `lit`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
