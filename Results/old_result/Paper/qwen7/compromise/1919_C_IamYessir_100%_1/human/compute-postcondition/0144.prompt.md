Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 0, and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x > y`, then `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y` holds true for the current value of `x`, or `b` has an additional element which is equal to `lit[0]`. If `x <= y`, then `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` equals `y`, `a` has its last element as `lit[0]`. If `x` is less than `y`, `x` is added to `b` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 2, and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y` and `y` is less than `lit[2]`, then `b` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `b` is `lit[2]`. If `x` is not greater than `y` and `lit[2] > x`, then `b` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `b` is `lit[2]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `lit[2]`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[1]`. Otherwise, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` remains positive infinity (`float('inf')`). If `b` is not empty, `y` is updated to `lit[1]` if it is greater than the current `y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 4, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is either `lit[0]` or `x`), and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` (depending on whether `b` is empty or not). 

- If `x > y`, then:
  - `b` contains one additional element which is `lit[3]` if `y >= lit[i]`.
  - `lit[i]` becomes the last element of `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `y < lit[i]`.
  - Otherwise, the values of `cp`, `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
  
- If `x <= y`, then:
  - `i` remains 4 and `x` remains `lit[i]`.
  - If `x == y`, then `b` can be any list.
  - If `x < y`, then `b` can be any list.
  - If `x >= y` and `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, then `b` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
