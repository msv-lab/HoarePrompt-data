Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and 1 ≤ i ≤ m and i^2 ≤ n + i after calling `func_7()` which assigns new values to `n` and `m`.**

The code `n, m = func_7()` calls the function `func_7()`, which returns two values, `n` and `m`. These values are then assigned to the respective variables. Since the exact implementation of `func_7()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `n` and `m` after the function call. However, we know that they remain positive integers within the specified range and satisfy the condition \(1 \leq i \leq m\) and \(i^2 \leq n + i\).
