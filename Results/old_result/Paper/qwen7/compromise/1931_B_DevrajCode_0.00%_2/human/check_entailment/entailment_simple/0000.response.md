### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers using the allowed operations (pouring water from one container to another).

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), it is always possible to equalize the water in all containers to the average amount of water per container (`total_water / n`). This is because the total water can be evenly distributed among all containers.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through each container, adjusting a cumulative difference (`container`) between the current total and the target.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the total water is not divisible by `n` by immediately returning 'No'.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the total water is divisible by `n` and the distribution can be achieved.

5. **Given Test Cases**:
   - The annotated program correctly outputs 'YES' for cases where the water can be equally distributed and 'NO' for cases where it cannot.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to equalize the water in all containers. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
