Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it converts the integer `x` into a 30-bit binary representation. This part is handled correctly using bitwise operations.
3. The program then iterates through the binary representation and applies the specified rules:
   - If a '1' is found, it is kept as '1'.
   - If consecutive '1's are found, they are replaced with '-1' and a '0'.
   - If a '0' follows a '1', it is changed to '0' and the previous '1' is changed to '-1'.
4. After processing, the program outputs the length of the modified binary string and the string itself.
5. The rules applied ensure that the resulting binary string meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem statement accurately and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
