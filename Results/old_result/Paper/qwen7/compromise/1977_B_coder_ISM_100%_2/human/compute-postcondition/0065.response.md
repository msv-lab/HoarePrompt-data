Postcondition: `i` is 2, `flag` is either 0 or 1, the character at index 0 of string `s` is '1'. If `flag` is 1 and the character at index 2 of string `s` is '0', the character at index 2 of string `s` remains '1'. If `flag` is 0 or the character at index 2 of string `s` is not '0', the character at index 2 of string `s` remains unchanged.
