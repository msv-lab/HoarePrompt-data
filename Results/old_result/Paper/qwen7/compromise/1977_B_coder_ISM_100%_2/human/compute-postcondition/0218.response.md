Output State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains '1' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is a list where each element corresponds to whether the i-th bit of `x` is set to 1 (in which case it contains '1') or 0 (in which case it contains '0'). Since `i` is 0, the first bit of `x` is being checked, and it is set to 1, so `'1'` is appended to `s`. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged.
