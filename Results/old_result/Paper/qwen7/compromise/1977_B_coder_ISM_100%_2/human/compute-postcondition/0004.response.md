Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an empty list, length is 30**.

The code simply assigns the value 30 to the variable `length`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
