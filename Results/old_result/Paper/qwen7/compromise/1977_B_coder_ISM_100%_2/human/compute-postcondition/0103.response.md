Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 29.
- `flag` is either 0 or 1.
- The character at index 0 of string `s` is '1'.
- Characters at indices 1 through 28 of string `s` are either '0' or '-1' depending on the value of `flag`.
- The character at index 29 of string `s` is '0' if `flag` is 1, and '1' if `flag` is 0.
- The length of string `s` is 30.

The `print(length)` statement will print the length of string `s`.

Since the length of string `s` is explicitly stated to be 30, regardless of the value of `flag`, the print statement will output this length.

Output: **30**
