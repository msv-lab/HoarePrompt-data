Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, and `s` contains '0' at index 0**

The code `s.append('0')` appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains `'1'` at index 0 because the i-th bit of `x` (where `i` is 1) is set to 1. After appending `'0'` to `s`, the list `s` now contains `'0'` at index 0. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged.
