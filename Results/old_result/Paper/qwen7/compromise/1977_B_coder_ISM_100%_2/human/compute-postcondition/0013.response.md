Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `nalla`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to 29 (inclusive).

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `nalla` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of length 30.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 29.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `x & pow(2, i)` is true.
   - If true, the first element of `s` is set to '1'.
   - Otherwise, the first element of `s` is set to '0', and all other elements remain as empty elements.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.
   - `nalla` remains unchanged and stays at 0.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
   - `nalla` remains 0.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains a list of length 30, but its contents might have changed based on the loop body.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `nalla` remains 0.
- `t` remains within the specified range.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains a list of length 30, but the first element might be updated based on the loop body.

Since the loop condition depends on `i` being less than 30, the next value of `i` should be checked against this condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 1 (if previously `i` was 0), `s` is a list of length 30**.
