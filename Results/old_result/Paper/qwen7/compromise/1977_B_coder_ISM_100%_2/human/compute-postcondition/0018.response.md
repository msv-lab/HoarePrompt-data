Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(30)`. This means the loop variable `i` is being iterated from 0 to 29.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `nalla` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 1 (since it was 0 in the previous iteration and now it's 1).
   - `s` is a list of length 31 where the last element is either '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than 30. Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `i < 30`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - The value of `t`, `nalla`, and `x` remain unchanged.
   - The list `s` will have its 2nd element (index 1) updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` remains greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `nalla` remains 0.
- `x` remains the same input integer.
- `i` becomes 2.
- `s` is a list of length 31 where the last element is either '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false, and the 2nd element (index 1) of `s` is updated accordingly.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of length 31 where the last element is either '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false, and the 2nd element of `s` is updated accordingly**.
