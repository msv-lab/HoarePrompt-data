Output State: **`nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with length 31, and '1' is appended to the list `s`.**

The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally had a length of 30, after appending `'1'`, its length becomes 31. All other variables remain unchanged.
