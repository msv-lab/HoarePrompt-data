Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[2]` is '-1', and `s[3]` is '1' if `flag` is 0, and equal to `s[2]` which is '-1' otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[2]` to '-1' since `i` is 2. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged. Since `s[3]` was previously equal to 's[2]' if `flag` is 0, and '1' otherwise, with `s[2]` now being '-1', `s[3]` will be '-1' if `flag` is 0, and '1' if `flag` is 1.
