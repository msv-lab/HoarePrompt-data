Reasoning:
The annotated program does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for the game as described. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Case `a == b`:**
   - The program correctly outputs "Bob" because if both players have the same number of coins, Bob can always force a win by mirroring Alice's moves.

2. **Case `a == 1`:**
   - The program correctly outputs "Alice" because if Alice has only one coin, she can immediately lose if she swaps wallets, leaving Bob with one coin to win on his next turn.

3. **Case `b == 1`:**
   - The program incorrectly outputs "Bob". This case should also result in "Alice" winning if Alice has more than one coin. If Alice has more than one coin, she can always swap wallets and leave Bob with one coin, ensuring her victory.

4. **Case `a % 2 == 1`:**
   - The program incorrectly outputs "Bob". This condition should lead to "Alice" winning if `a` is odd and `b` is even, because Alice can always swap wallets and leave Bob with an even number of coins, which is a losing position for Bob.

5. **Case `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`:**
   - The program correctly outputs "Alice" because if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can always swap wallets and leave Bob with an even number of coins, which is a losing position for Bob.

6. **Case `a > b`:**
   - The program incorrectly outputs "Bob". This condition should result in "Alice" winning if `a` is greater than `b` and both are even, because Alice can always swap wallets and leave Bob with an even number of coins, which is a losing position for Bob.

7. **Default Case:**
   - The program incorrectly outputs "Alice" in all other cases, which is not always correct. For example, if `a` is even and `b` is even, and `a < b`, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and win.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
