Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick and no stick can be reused.
2. A regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length.
3. To maximize the number of polygons, we need to find the minimum frequency of any stick length (since each polygon requires at least one complete set of sticks of the same length).
4. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary.
5. It then computes the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4 (since a quadrilateral, which is the simplest regular polygon, requires 4 sticks of the same length). This step ensures that we count the maximum number of quadrilaterals (or other regular polygons) that can be formed from the available sticks.
6. The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the requirements of the problem.

Given this analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
