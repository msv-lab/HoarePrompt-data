Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the number of complete polygons (where each polygon requires 4 sides) that can be formed, but it does not account for the possibility of forming multiple polygons with different numbers of sides (e.g., triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.). The solution should consider the minimum number of sides required for a polygon (which is 3) and then determine how many such polygons can be formed with the given sticks.
