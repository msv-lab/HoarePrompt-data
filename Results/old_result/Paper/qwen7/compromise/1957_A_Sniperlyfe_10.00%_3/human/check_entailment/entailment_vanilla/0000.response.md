Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks.
2. A regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length.
3. The solution involves counting the frequency of each stick length and then determining how many complete sets of 4 sticks (minimum required for a quadrilateral, which is the simplest polygon) can be formed.
4. The function `func_1` correctly counts the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary.
5. It then calculates the total number of regular polygons by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 and summing these values.
6. The main loop reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` with the list of stick lengths.
7. The provided code matches the requirements of the problem and does not contain any logical errors.

Given this analysis, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
