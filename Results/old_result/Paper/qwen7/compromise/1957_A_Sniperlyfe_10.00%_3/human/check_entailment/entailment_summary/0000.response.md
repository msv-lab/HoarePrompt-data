Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where each polygon must have all sides of equal length and no stick can be used more than once.
- The provided code defines a function `func_1` which correctly calculates the frequency of each unique stick length and then computes how many complete polygons can be formed by dividing the count of each length by 4 (since each polygon needs 4 sides).
- The function `func_1` is called within a loop that processes each test case as specified.
- The logic in `func_1` is sound: it counts the occurrences of each stick length and then determines how many complete sets of 4 sticks of the same length can be formed, which corresponds to the number of polygons that can be built.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
