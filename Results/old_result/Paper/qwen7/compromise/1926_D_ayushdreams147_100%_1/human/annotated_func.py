#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and a is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
            if count[num] == 0:
                del count[num]
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is the number of unique elements in the list `a`, `n` is the same positive integer as before, `a` is the same list of non-negative integers, and `count` is an empty dictionary since all entries in it are deleted during the loop execution.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in the list 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It processes the list `a` to count the number of unique elements and returns this count. After execution, the function modifies the internal state by using a dictionary `count` to keep track of occurrences of transformed values of elements in `a`, but ensures this dictionary is empty by the end of the function.
