Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, removals + 1)`. This means `i` will take values from 1 to `removals` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`. Therefore, `removals` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `removals` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `i` must be initialized to 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `removals` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.
