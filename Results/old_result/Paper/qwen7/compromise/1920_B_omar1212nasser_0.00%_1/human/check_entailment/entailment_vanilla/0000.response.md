Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` with parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.
   - It prints the result returned by `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`.
   - It has a conditional statement that returns `0` if `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`. This condition is hardcoded and doesn't seem to be based on the problem description.
   - It initializes an empty list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array `elements`.
   - It calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements `n`.
   - It appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos` (this represents the scenario where Alice removes nothing and Bob negates the last `negatives` elements).
   - It iteratively updates `s` by subtracting the last element of `elements` and tries to update `n` by adding the difference between the last `negatives + i` and `i` elements.
   - If there's an `IndexError` (which should not happen since we're iterating up to `removals`), it sets `n` to `0`.
   - It appends the updated value of `s - 2 * n` to `pos` for each iteration.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Hardcoded Condition**:
   - The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is hardcoded and does not make sense in the context of the problem. This should be removed or replaced with logic based on the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside the loop for updating `s` and `n` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to minimize the negative impact on the sum.
   - Bob should negate the largest elements to minimize the sum.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Remove the smallest elements to ensure Alice maximizes the sum.
2. Negate the largest elements to ensure Bob minimizes the sum.

Here's a corrected version of the functions:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        result = func_2(n, k, x, a)
        print(result)

def func_2(n, k, x, elements):
    # Remove k smallest elements
    elements = elements[k:]
    
    # Negate x largest elements
    elements[-x:] = [-e for e in elements[-x:]]
    
    return sum(elements)

# Example usage
func_1()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to the hardcoded condition and the flawed logic inside `func_2`. The corrected approach involves removing the smallest elements and negating the largest elements, which aligns with the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: False**
