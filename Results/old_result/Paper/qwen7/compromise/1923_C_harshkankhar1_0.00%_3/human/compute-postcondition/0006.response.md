Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the list up to that index, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the previous element `b[i-1]` and 1 if the corresponding element `a[i]` is greater than 1 or 2 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module is used to create a new list `a` where each element is the sum of all previous elements in the original list `a`.
- The list `b` is updated such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the previous element `b[i-1]` and `x`, where `x` is 1 if the corresponding element `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2. This means that the value of `b[i]` depends on the accumulated value of `a` and the condition specified for `x`.
