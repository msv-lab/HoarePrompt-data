Output State: The output state will consist of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the input values provided for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, it will print 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The exact sequence of these outputs depends on the inputs given during each iteration of the loop.
