Output State: **`i` is 20, `len(nums)` is 22, `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19, `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Since `len(nums)` was initially 21, after appending, the length of `nums` becomes 22. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 20, and `idx` retains its original value which is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19. The new element appended to `nums` is specifically `k - nums[idx]`.
