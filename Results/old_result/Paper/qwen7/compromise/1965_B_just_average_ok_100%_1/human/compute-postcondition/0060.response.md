Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `len(nums)`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 20.
   - `len(nums)` is initially set to 21.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. Given that `len(nums)` is 21, the loop will run while `i < 21`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 20, the loop will execute once because `20 < 21` is true.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will become 21 (post-increment), and the condition `i < 21` will no longer hold true, terminating the loop.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is within the range that allows the loop to execute at least once.

**State:**
**`i` is 20, `len(nums)` is 21**
