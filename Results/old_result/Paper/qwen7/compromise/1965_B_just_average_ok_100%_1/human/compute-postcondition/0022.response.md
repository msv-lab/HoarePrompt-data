Output State: **`idx` is 20, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[20]` appended to it, and `i` is 21.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 20, the value appended to `nums` is `k - nums[20]`. The value of `nums[20]` is \(2^{20}\). Therefore, the new element appended to `nums` is `k - 2^{20}`. All other variables remain unchanged.
