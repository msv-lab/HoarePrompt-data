Output State: **`idx` is 20, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[20]` and `k + 1` appended to it, and `i` is 22.**

Explanation: The code `nums.append(k + 1)` appends the value `k + 1` to the list `nums`. The initial list `nums` contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[20]` appended to it. After appending `k + 1`, the length of the list increases by 1, making `i` (which was initially 21) now 22. All other variables remain unchanged.
