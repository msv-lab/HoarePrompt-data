Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `idx` is 20.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The value of `t` is not specified, but it doesn't affect the length of `nums`.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers. Their specific values are not provided, but they do not affect the length of `nums` either.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[20]` and `k + 1` appended to it. This means `nums` contains the following elements:
     - \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots, 2^{20}\)
     - `k - nums[20]`
     - `k + 1`
   - `i` is 22, but this variable is not used in the calculation of the length of `nums`.

2. **Construction of `nums`:**
   - The list starts with the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
   - The 21st element (`nums[20]`) is \(2^{20}\).
   - An additional element `k - nums[20]` is appended, which is `k - 2^{20}`.
   - Another element `k + 1` is appended.

3. **Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, there are 21 elements in the list (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
   - Two more elements are appended, making the total length of `nums` 23.

4. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet is `print(len(nums))`.
   - Since `nums` has 23 elements, the length of `nums` is 23.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **23**
