Output State: **`i` is 20, `len(nums)` is 21, and `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will take on the value of the last index in the `nums` list, which is 20 (since list indices start at 0). The length of `nums` remains unchanged at 21. The variable `idx` will be either -1 (if no element in `nums` is greater than `k` and thus the loop breaks without assigning a new value to `idx`) or it will be set to the index `i-1` where `nums[i]` is the first element in the list that is greater than `k`. If such an element is found, `idx` will be set to that index; otherwise, it remains -1.
