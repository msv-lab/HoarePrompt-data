Output State: **`i` is 20, `len(nums)` is 24, `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19, `nums[-1]` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`. Since `len(nums)` was initially 23, after appending, the length of `nums` becomes 24. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 20. The value of `idx` remains either -1 or a value between 0 and 19. The last element of `nums` (`nums[-1]`) is now `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
