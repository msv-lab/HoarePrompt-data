Output State: **`idx` is 20, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[20]` and `k + 1` appended to it, and `i` is 22; `nums` now contains an additional element which is `k + nums[20] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `nums` contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), plus two additional elements: `k - nums[20]` and `k + 1`.
- The code appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
- Since `idx` is 20, `nums[20]` is \(2^{20}\).
- Therefore, the new element appended to `nums` is `k + 2^{20} + 1`.

Thus, the updated `nums` list includes all previous elements plus the new element `k + 2^{20} + 1`.
