Output State: **`i` is 20, `len(nums)` is 23, `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19, `nums[-1]` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at the index `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Since `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19, `1 << idx` will be either 0 (if `idx` is -1) or a power of 2 between 1 and 32 (if `idx` is between 0 and 19). However, since `len(nums)` is 24, the valid indices for removal are from 0 to 23. Therefore, the element at the calculated index is removed, reducing the length of `nums` by 1. The values of `i`, `idx`, and `nums[-1]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the removal operation.
