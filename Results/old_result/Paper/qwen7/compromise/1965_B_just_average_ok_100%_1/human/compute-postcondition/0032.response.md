Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that will take values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`.

3. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `idx` is -1.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user.
   - `nums` is a list containing the first 21 powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\).

4. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`.
   - Since `nums` is a list with 21 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `len(nums)` will be 21.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The loop will start with `i` being 0 (since `range(len(nums))` generates values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`).
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `len(nums)` is 21 for the loop to start executing.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(nums)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(nums)` is 21**
