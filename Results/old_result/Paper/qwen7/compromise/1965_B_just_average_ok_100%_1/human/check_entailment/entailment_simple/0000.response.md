Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This ensures that the sequence can handle sums up to \(2^{21} - 1\), which is more than sufficient given the constraints \(2 \le n \le 10^6\) and \(1 \le k \le n\).
   - For each test case, it finds the largest power of 2 (`1 << i`) that is less than or equal to `k`. This is done using the loop and the `idx` variable.
   - It then appends three specific values to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: Ensures that subsequences can sum to `k - (2^i)`.
     - `k + 1`: Ensures that subsequences can sum to `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: Ensures that subsequences can sum to `k + (2^i) + 1`.
   - Finally, it removes the element `1 << idx` from `nums` to ensure the sequence size is at most 25.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `nums` and then prints the elements of `nums`.
   - Given the constraints, the length of `nums` after processing all test cases will be at most 25, as required.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The approach ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` because the elements are specifically chosen to avoid this.
   - For all `v` where `1 \le v \le n` and `v \ne k`, the sequence can form a subsequence that sums to `v` due to the inclusion of powers of 2 and the additional elements added.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
