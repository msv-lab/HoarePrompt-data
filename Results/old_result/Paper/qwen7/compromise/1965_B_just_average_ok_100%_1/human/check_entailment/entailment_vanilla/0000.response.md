Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This is done using the list comprehension `[1 << i for i in range(21)]`.
   - It then iterates through this list to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This index is stored in `idx`.
   - If `nums[idx]` is greater than `k`, it breaks the loop.
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`.
   - Finally, it removes `1 << idx` from the list `nums`.

3. **Printing Output**:
   - The length of the list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of the list `nums` are printed.

### Checking the Logic

#### Test Case Analysis

1. **Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `k = 2`**
   - The generated sequence should have no subsequence summing to 2, but include all sums from 1 to 1.
   - The sequence should be `[1]`.
   - The program generates `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]` and removes `1`, resulting in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]`.
   - This is incorrect.

2. **Test Case 2: `n = 6`, `k = 1`**
   - The generated sequence should have no subsequence summing to 1, but include all sums from 2 to 6.
   - The sequence should be `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
   - The program generates `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]` and removes `1`, resulting in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]`.
   - This is incorrect.

3. **Test Case 3: `n = 8`, `k = 8`**
   - The generated sequence should have no subsequence summing to 8, but include all sums from 1 to 7.
   - The sequence should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
   - The program generates `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]` and removes `1`, resulting in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]`.
   - This is incorrect.

4. **Test Case 4: `n = 9`, `k = 3`**
   - The generated sequence should have no subsequence summing to 3, but include all sums from 1 to 2 and 4 to 9.
   - The sequence should be `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
   - The program generates `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]` and removes `1`, resulting in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]`.
   - This is incorrect.

5. **Test Case 5: `n = 10`, `k = 7`**
   - The generated sequence should have no subsequence summing to 7, but include all sums from 1 to 6 and 8 to 10.
   - The sequence should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]`.
   - The program generates `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]` and removes `1`, resulting in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]`.
   - This is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not generate the correct sequence for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
