The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \(t\), \(n\), and \(k\). For each test case, it calculates specific values based on \(k\) and appends these values to a list `nums`. The list initially contains all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). For each \(k\), it adds \(k - \text{max power of 2} \leq k\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{max power of 2} + 1\) to `nums`, then removes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\). After processing all test cases, the function prints the length of the final `nums` list and the list itself.
