Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5**

The code `i = 0` sets the variable `i` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
