Output State: `i` is 15, `c` is 14, `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3, 2, k0 - 7, 8, k0 - 15, 16, k0 - 31, 32, k0 - 63, 64, k0 - 127, 128]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each value in the list `arr` which contains the integers [0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191]. Since the loop breaks when `c` equals `n - 1`, and given that `n` is the first integer from the list `l1`, and `k0` is the original value of `k`, the loop will execute exactly 14 times (since `arr` has 14 elements). After 14 iterations, `i` will be the last element in `arr`, which is 15, but since the loop condition checks against the list `arr` and increments `c` based on its index, `i` remains as the current element being processed in the loop. The variable `c` will be 14 after the loop completes. The list `ans` will contain the elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3, 2, k0 - 7, 8, k0 - 15, 16, k0 - 31, 32, k0 - 63, 64, k0 - 127, 128]`, where each element is generated according to the loop's logic.
