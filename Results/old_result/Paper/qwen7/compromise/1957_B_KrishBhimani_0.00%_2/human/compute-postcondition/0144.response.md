Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`, `c` is 1, and `ans` contains [1 << i]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` (which is `2^i`) to the list `ans`. Since `i` is one of the elements in `arr`, the value of `1 << i` will be a power of 2 corresponding to the value of `i`. However, without a specific value for `i`, we can only say that `ans` now contains `[1 << i]`, where `i` is one of the elements from the array `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
