Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and 3, `i` is 3.**

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
