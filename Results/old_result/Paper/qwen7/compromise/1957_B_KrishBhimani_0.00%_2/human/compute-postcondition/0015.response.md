Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is half of its original value (k0 >> 1) and k0 must be at least 2, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0 and 1, `i` is 2. If `k` is odd, `k` is adjusted to be even by adding 1.**
