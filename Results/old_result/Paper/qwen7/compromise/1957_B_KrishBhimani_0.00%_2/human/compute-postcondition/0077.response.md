The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 3, so now `i` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is half of its original value (k0), `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and 3, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5, and `k` is now `k0` right-shifted by 1.
