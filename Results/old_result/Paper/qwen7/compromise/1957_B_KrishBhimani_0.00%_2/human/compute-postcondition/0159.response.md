Output State: `k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is 15, `c` is 16, `ans` contains [0, -1, 2, -2, 1, -4, 2, -8, 4, -16, 8, -32, 16, -64, 32, -128, 64, -135].

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the array `arr`. For each iteration, it appends `1 << i` to the list `ans` and increments `c`. The loop breaks when `c` equals the length of `arr` minus one (i.e., `c == 15`). After appending the value for `i = 15`, `c` becomes 16, and the loop terminates. The final value of `ans` is calculated as `k0 - sum(ans)`, where `k0` is the initial value of `k` (which is 0), resulting in `ans` being `[0, -1, 2, -2, 1, -4, 2, -8, 4, -16, 8, -32, 16, -64, 32, -128, 64, -135]`.
