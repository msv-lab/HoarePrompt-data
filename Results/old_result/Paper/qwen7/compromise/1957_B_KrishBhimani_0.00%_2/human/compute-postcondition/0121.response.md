Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k`. This means the loop will continue as long as `k` is non-zero.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an odd integer divided by 2 using bitwise right shift. This implies that `k` was originally an even number, and after the bitwise right shift, it became an odd number. For example, if `k` was 6 (binary 110), after the bitwise right shift, it would become 3 (binary 11).
   - `arr` contains the integer `i`.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `k` is non-zero. Since `k` is currently an odd integer, it is non-zero.
   - However, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must remain non-zero. Given that `k` is derived from an even number through a bitwise right shift, the next value of `k` will depend on the original even number before the shift.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `k` remains non-zero for the next iteration. Since `k` is derived from an even number, the original even number must have been non-zero for `k` to be non-zero after the bitwise right shift.
   - The only state that directly affects the loop condition is `k`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` should remain non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` must be non-zero, `arr` contains the integer `i`, and `i` is increased by 1**
