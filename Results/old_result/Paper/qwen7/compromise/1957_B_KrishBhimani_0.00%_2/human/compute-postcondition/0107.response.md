Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 15.
   - `c` is 14.
   - `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3, 2, k0 - 7, 8, k0 - 15, 16, k0 - 31, 32, k0 - 63, 64, k0 - 127, 128, 0, 0]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list `ans` so that each element of the list is printed separately.

Given the list `ans`:
- The first element is `1`.
- The second element is `k0 - 1`.
- The third element is `1`.
- The fourth element is `k0 - 3`.
- The fifth element is `2`.
- The sixth element is `k0 - 7`.
- The seventh element is `8`.
- The eighth element is `k0 - 15`.
- The ninth element is `16`.
- The tenth element is `k0 - 31`.
- The eleventh element is `32`.
- The twelfth element is `k0 - 63`.
- The thirteenth element is `64`.
- The fourteenth element is `k0 - 127`.
- The fifteenth element is `128`.
- The sixteenth and seventeenth elements are both `0`.

Since `k0` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will include `k0 - 1`, `k0 - 3`, `k0 - 7`, `k0 - 15`, `k0 - 31`, `k0 - 63`, and `k0 - 127` as placeholders for the corresponding expressions involving `k0`.

Output: **1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3, 2, k0 - 7, 8, k0 - 15, 16, k0 - 31, 32, k0 - 63, 64, k0 - 127, 128, 0, 0**
