Output State: **`k` is half of its original value, `arr` contains the integers `i`, `i+1`, and `i+1`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k` by 1 bit, which effectively divides `k` by 2. The other variables (`arr` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
