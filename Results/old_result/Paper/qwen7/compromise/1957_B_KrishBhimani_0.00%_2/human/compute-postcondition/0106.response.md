Output State: **`i` is 15, `c` is 14, `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3, 2, k0 - 7, 8, k0 - 15, 16, k0 - 31, 32, k0 - 63, 64, k0 - 127, 128, 0, 0]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `0` to the list `ans` for each missing element to make the length of `ans` equal to `n`. Initially, `ans` has 15 elements, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`, which is also 15. Since `ans` already has 15 elements, no new elements are appended, and the list `ans` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `i` and `c`, and the unchanged list `ans`.
