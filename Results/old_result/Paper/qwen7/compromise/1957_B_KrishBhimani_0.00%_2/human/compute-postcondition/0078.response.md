Output State: `i` is 16, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is now equal to `k0` right-shifted by 15 bits (which is equivalent to `k0 // 32768`), `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues until `k` becomes 0. Since `k` is initially some positive integer `k0`, and it is halved in each iteration (`k = k >> 1`), it will take 15 iterations for `k` to become 0 if `k0` is \(2^{15} - 1\) (i.e., 32767). In each iteration, when `k & 1 == 1`, the index `i` is appended to the list `arr`. After 15 iterations, `i` will be 16 because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. The list `arr` will contain all the indices where the binary representation of `k0` has a 1, which for \(2^{15} - 1\) are the indices from 0 to 15.
