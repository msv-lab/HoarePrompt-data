Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `i` is 8, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. Since the loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero and `k` is right-shifted by one bit each iteration, and given that `k` originally had a value of 4 (which is 100 in binary), it would take 3 shifts to become 0. During these iterations, the value of `i` is appended to the list `arr` and incremented by 1 each time. Thus, `arr` contains [0, 1, 3, 4] and `i` is incremented to 8. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k0`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
