Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `ans` is calculated as \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor} \left(\frac{n + i}{i \cdot i}\right)\).
- `root` is calculated as \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + 1\).

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n` and the sum of the expression \(\frac{n + i}{i \cdot i}\) for each `i` from 2 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).

Given the explicit formula for `ans`, the precise value of `ans` depends on the specific value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^6\), the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the exact value of `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)) (where n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6)**
