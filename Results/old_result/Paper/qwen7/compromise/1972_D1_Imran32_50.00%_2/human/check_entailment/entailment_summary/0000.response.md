Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The program calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on a specific formula that does not match the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates the value of `ans` using the formula `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the given program does not account for the second condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
