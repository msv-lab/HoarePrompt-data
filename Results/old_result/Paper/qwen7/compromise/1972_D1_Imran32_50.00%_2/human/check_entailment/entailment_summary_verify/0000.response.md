Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Problem Description**: We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` calculates the value of `ans` as `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))`. This calculation does not involve checking the gcd condition or ensuring that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Analysis**: Consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
   - The correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
   - The program will output 3, which is incorrect because it does not account for the gcd condition and the multiple condition.

Let's verify this with the given example:
- For \(n = 2\):
  - The loop in `func_1` runs for \(i = 2\):
    - \(cnt = 2^2 = 4\)
    - \(\text{ans} += (2 + 2) // 4 = 1\)
  - So, \(\text{ans} = 2 + 1 = 3\)

This result is incorrect because it does not satisfy the problem's conditions. The correct answer for \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\) should be 3, but the program outputs 3 without verifying the conditions.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the problem description.

Final: **False**
