Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem. The key issue lies in the calculation of `ans`. The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the current implementation of `func_1()` does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it calculates a sum involving the square root of `n`, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check whether they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)

# The rest of the program remains the same
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). If they do, it increments the count `ans`.

Given this analysis, the original function is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
