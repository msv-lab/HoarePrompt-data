Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 6]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is either `['NO', 'YES']` or `['NO', 'NO']` depending on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
