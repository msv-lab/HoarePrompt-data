Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `index` is `x + 2`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]]` still includes the value 3, `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `mp[pf[4]]` includes the value 4**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Since `i` is 4, it appends 4 to `mp[pf[4]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
