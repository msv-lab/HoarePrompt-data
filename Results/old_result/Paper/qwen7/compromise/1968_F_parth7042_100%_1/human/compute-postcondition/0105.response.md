Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `index` is `x + 2`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]]` still includes the value 3, `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `index` is `x + 2`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, and `mp[pf[3]]` still includes the value 3.
- The code updates `pf[4]` to `pf[3] ^ a[4]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
