Output State: **`index` is 27, `q` is int(data[27]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[22]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[23]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`**

Explanation: The code `q = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `q` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, which is `data[27]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `index` is updated to `27` because the assignment increments the index by 1.
