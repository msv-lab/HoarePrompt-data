Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 6, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length 7 containing only zeros, `pf` is a list of length 7 containing only zeros, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is 7, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length 7 with `a[6]` being an integer and the rest being 0, `pf` is a list of length 7 where each element is calculated as `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` starting from `pf[0] = 0`, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value `[0]`, `n` must be at least 1, `mp[pf[i]]` appends `i` to the list `mp[pf[i]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `index` is 8, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length 7 with `a[8]` being an integer and `a[6]` being 0, `pf` is a list of length 8 where `pf[8] = pf[7] ^ a[8]`, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value `[0]`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 9, `mp[pf[9]].append(9)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `index` is 9, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length 7 with `a[10]` being an integer and `a[6]` being 0, `pf` is a list of length 8 where `pf[10] = pf[9] ^ a[10]`, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value `[0]`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 10, `mp[pf[10]]` is appended with `10`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
