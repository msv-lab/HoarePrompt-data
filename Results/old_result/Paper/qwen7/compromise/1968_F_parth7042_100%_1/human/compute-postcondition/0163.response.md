Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is now `x + n + 2`, `results` contains a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration, and `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `q = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of the element at `data[index + 1]` to the variable `q`. Since `index` was initially `x + n + 1`, after executing the line, `index` is updated to `x + n + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
