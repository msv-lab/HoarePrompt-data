Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 6, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, and `results` is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2])`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `l`, which updates the value of `l` but does not affect any other variables.
- All other variables retain their previous values and expressions.
