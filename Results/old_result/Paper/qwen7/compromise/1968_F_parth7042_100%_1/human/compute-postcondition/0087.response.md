Output State: **`index` is 29, `q` is int(data[27]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[22]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[23]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated value of `index` is 29 (originally 27 + 2), while the values of `q`, `x`, `l`, `r`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `results` remain the same as their initial states.
