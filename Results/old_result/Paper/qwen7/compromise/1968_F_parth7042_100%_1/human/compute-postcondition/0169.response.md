Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 (since `range(1, n + 1)` starts from 1).
   - The variable `n` is not explicitly stated in the given state, but it is a crucial part of the loop condition.

3. **Adjust the states of the loop head variables**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1`.

4. **Consider other relevant variables**:
   - Variables like `mp[0]`, `a`, `index`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `pf` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
