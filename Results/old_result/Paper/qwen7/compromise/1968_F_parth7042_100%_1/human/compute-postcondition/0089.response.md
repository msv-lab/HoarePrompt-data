Output State: **`index` is 29, `q` is int(data[27]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[22]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[23]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`, `pf` is `[0] * (n + 1)`**

Explanation: The line `pf = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes the list `pf` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
