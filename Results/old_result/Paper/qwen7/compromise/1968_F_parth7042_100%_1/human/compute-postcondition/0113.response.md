Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that the variable `x` is now assigned the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation between the value of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
