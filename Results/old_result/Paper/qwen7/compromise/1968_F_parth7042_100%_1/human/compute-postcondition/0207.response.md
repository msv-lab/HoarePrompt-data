Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 0, `index` is `data[index + 2]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` equals 0, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is `['NO']`.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Since no conditions are met that would change the value of `results` from `['NO']`, it remains as `['NO']`.
