Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v1` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet only reassigns the value of `v1` to `mp[pf[r]]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables mentioned in the initial state, with `v1` being updated to `mp[pf[r]]`.
