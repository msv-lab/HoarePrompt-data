Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 8, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `results` is 'YES', and `results.append('YES')` has been executed.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was previously either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2])`, appending `'YES'` to it means that `results` is now `'YES'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
