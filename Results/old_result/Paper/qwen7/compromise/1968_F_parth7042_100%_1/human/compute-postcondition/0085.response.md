Output State: **`index` is 26, `q` is 1, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[22]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[23]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. Since `index` was initially 25, after executing this line, `index` is updated to 26. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description. The value of `results` is set to `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']` because the conditions for updating `results` based on `it1` and `it2` were not met (as no changes were made to these variables).
