Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `index` is now `x + n + 4`, `results` contains a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration, and `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `a = [0] * (n + 1)` creates a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `index`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `t`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for the newly created list `a`.
