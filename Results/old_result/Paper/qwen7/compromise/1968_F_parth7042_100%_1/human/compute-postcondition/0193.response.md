The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. All the variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 2]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and equals 0, `results` is a list containing `'YES'`.**
