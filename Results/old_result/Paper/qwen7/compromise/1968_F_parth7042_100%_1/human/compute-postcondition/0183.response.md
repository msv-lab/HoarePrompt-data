Output State: **`index` is 8, `pf[8]` is calculated as `pf[7] ^ a[7]`, `mp[pf[8]]` is a list containing the values `7`, `8`, and `a[8]` is assigned the value of `int(data[13])`, `pf[8]` is updated to `pf[7] ^ a[8]**.

Explanation: The code appends the current index `i` (which is 8) to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Since `pf[i]` is `pf[8]`, and previously `mp[pf[7]]` contained the values `[7, 8]`, after appending `8`, `mp[pf[8]]` now contains `[7, 8, 8]`. The value of `a[8]` is set to `int(data[13])`, and `pf[8]` is updated to `pf[7] ^ a[8]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
