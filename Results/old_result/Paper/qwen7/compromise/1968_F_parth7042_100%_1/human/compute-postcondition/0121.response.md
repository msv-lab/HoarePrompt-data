Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`**.

This means that the `bisect_left` function is called with `v1` (which is `mp[pf[r]]`) and `l` (which is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`). The result of this function call is stored in `it1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
