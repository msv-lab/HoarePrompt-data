Output State: **`index` is 14, `q` is 4, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `mp[pf[12]]` is appended with `12`, `l` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[13]`**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. Since `l` and `r` are integer values from `data[12]` and `data[13]` respectively, `x` is calculated using these values. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
