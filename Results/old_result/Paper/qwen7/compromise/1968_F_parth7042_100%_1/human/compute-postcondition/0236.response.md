Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 6]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` and now `it2` is recalculated to be `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `results` is `['YES']`. Otherwise, `results` is `['NO']`.**
