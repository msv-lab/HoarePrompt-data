Output State: **`index` is 49, `q` is the original `q` minus 3, `results` is a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on all the queries processed, and `a`, `pf`, and `mp` are reset to their initial states as defined in the initial state.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `index` will be incremented by 2 for each of the original `t` iterations, totaling an increment of `2 * t`. Given that `t` was initially set by extracting an integer from `data[0]` and assuming no changes to `t` during the loop, and considering the provided output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can deduce that `t` was likely set to a value that, when multiplied by 2 and added to the initial `index` value of 25 (after the first iteration), results in 49. This implies `t` was originally set to 24, leading to 24 iterations of the loop. Since the loop processes `q` queries and performs 3 iterations before reaching the state described, `q` is reduced by 3. The `results` list accumulates the outcomes of all queries, and `a`, `pf`, and `mp` are reset to their initial states as they are redefined at the start of each iteration.
