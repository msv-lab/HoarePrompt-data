You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It iterates through each test case, extracting `n`, `q`, and the array `a`.
3. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: 
   - It initializes a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - This is done efficiently with a loop.
4. **Mapping Prefix XORs**:
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to map each unique prefix XOR value to its indices.
   - This allows quick lookups of positions where the prefix XOR matches certain values.
5. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If this XOR is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a valid split point within the subarray using binary search (`bisect_left`).
6. **Output**:
   - It collects the results and prints them at the end.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic for calculating prefix XORs and mapping them is correct.
  - The use of binary search to find valid split points is appropriate.
  - The handling of edge cases (e.g., when the XOR of the subarray is zero) is correctly implemented.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The solution has a time complexity of \(O(n + q \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where the XOR of the subarray is zero correctly.
  - The binary search approach ensures that the split points are found efficiently.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
