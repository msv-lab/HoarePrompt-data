### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the original program and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Original Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions for Output:**
   - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, it prints "No".
   - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `m` and `n` are both even, it prints "Yes".
   - If `m` and `n` are both odd, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Correctness Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Parity Check Missing:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not check the parity of `n` and `m`. This is crucial because, as stated in the problem, the number of moves `n` and the resulting number of cubes `m` must have the same parity (both even or both odd).

2. **Example Test Cases:**
   - The provided examples in the problem description clearly show that when `n` and `m` have different parities, the correct answer should be "No". For instance, in the second test case `(2, 4)`, `n` is even and `m` is even, but the program incorrectly prints "No" without checking the parity.

#### Corrected Program:
The original assessment suggests adding a check to ensure `n` and `m` have the same parity before printing "Yes". The corrected version provided in the assessment is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m or (n % 2 == m % 2):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
This version correctly checks the parity of `n` and `m` and ensures that the output is "Yes" only if they have the same parity.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that the program processes each test case and prints "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions provided.
- The state transitions and conditions match the problem description and the corrected logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis and the corrected version provided, the original assessment is accurate. The program needs to check the parity of `n` and `m` to ensure correctness.

**Final: False**

The original program is incorrect due to the missing parity check, and the corrected version provided in the assessment is correct.
