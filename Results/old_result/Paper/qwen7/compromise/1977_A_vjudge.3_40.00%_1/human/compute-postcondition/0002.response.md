Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' and 'No' responses based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration. For each input pair (n, m), the loop checks if n equals m, if m is greater than n, if m is one less than n, or specific parity conditions between n and m. If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' will depend on the input values provided for each (n, m) pair during the loop's execution.
