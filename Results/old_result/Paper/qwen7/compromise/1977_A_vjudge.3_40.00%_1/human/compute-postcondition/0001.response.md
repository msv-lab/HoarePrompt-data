State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate numbers starting from 0 up to `t-1`.
3. The variable `i` will start at 0 during the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.

Given the initial state where `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute. Additionally, since `i` starts at 0 during the first iteration, we need to explicitly state that `i` is 0 before the loop starts.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
