Output State: The output state will consist of a series of "Yes" and "No" responses based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration. Specifically, for each pair of integers (n, m) entered, if n equals m, or if m is one less than n, or if both n and m are even, or if both n and m are odd, the output will be "Yes". Otherwise, the output will be "No". The exact sequence of "Yes" and "No" will depend on the input pairs provided during the loop's execution.
