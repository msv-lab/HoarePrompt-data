Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies handling a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the given test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` positive integers `a_i`. The function then performs some unspecified operation based on these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
