Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range `len(nums)`. This means `i` will take values from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `0` is added to the set `nums`.
   - `ls` is 0.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `nums`, these are the only variables that need to be adjusted.
   - The value of `i` will start from `0` and go up to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - The initial state of `nums` is given as a sorted list with `0` added to it.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with `0` added to it**
