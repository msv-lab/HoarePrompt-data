Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a set containing elements from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = set(input().split())` takes an input (which is an integer `N`), splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and then converts those elements into a set called `nums`. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
