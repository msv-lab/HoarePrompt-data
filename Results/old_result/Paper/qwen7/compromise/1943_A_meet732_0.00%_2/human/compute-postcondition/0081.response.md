Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `j` is 2.
2. `n` must be at least 3, but this does not affect the value of `j`.
3. `cntl[2]` is less than 2, but again, this does not impact the value of `j`.
4. `c` is decreased by 1, but the value of `c` itself is not relevant to the `print(j)` statement.

Given these points, the only variable that is explicitly mentioned and directly involved in the `print` statement is `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
