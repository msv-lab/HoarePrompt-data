Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `cntl[2]` is less than 2, but the exact value of `cntl[2]` is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
   - `c` is either False or `j` (which is 2) equals `n` - 1. Since `j` is 2, this means `c` is True if `n` is 3, otherwise `c` is False.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement simply prints the value of `j`.

Given that `j` is explicitly stated to be 2, the print statement will output the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
