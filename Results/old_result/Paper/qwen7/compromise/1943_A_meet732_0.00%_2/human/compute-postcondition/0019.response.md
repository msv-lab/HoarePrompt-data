Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than or equal to 1**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1 (`c -= 1`). Since the initial postcondition specified that the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2, after decrementing `c` by 1, the new value of `cntl[j]` will be less than or equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
