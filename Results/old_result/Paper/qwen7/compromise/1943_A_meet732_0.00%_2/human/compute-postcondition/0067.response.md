Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `cntl[j]` is less than 1, and either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the given code snippet, the initial conditions remain valid.
