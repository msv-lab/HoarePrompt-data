Based on the initial state provided:

- The variable `cntl` is updated such that for each index `i` present in the list `a`, the value at `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`. 
- All other elements in `cntl` (those indices not present in `a`) will remain as 0.
- The list `a` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- The condition `cntl[0] == 0` is true.

The print statement `print(0)` simply outputs the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
