Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `j` is 2. The variable `c` is 0, and `cntl[2]` is less than or equal to 0. The loop has broken out due to the condition `not c or j == n` being true.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the final state indicates that `j` has reached 2 (as it cannot go beyond `n` and the loop breaks when `c` becomes 0 or `j` equals `n`). The value of `c` is 0 because it was decremented each time `cntl[j]` was less than 2, and once `c` reaches 0, the loop breaks. Additionally, `cntl[2]` is less than or equal to 0, as this condition was necessary for the loop to continue and eventually break.
