Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has processed every element in the list `a`. For each element `i` in `a`, the corresponding index `i` in the list `cntl` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`. Therefore, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` represents how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

In other words, `cntl` is a frequency count of the elements in `a`, with `cntl[i]` indicating the frequency of the integer `i` in the list `a`.
