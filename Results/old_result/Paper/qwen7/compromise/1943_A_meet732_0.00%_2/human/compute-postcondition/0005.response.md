Output State: **`i` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0, `cntl[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Initially, `cntl[i]` is 0 (as per the initial state where every element in `cntl` is 0). After executing the code, `cntl[i]` becomes 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
