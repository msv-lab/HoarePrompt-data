Output State: The list `cntl` will have been updated such that for every integer `i` present in the list `a`, the corresponding index `i` in `cntl` will contain the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`. All other elements in `cntl` (those indices not present in `a`) will remain 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cntl[i]` for any `i` in `a` will reflect the frequency of `i` in the list `a`, and all other elements in `cntl` will still be 0 since they were not incremented during the loop.
