Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `j` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts with `j = 1`).
   - `n` is a constant or a variable that determines the number of iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Check the given state before the loop**:
   - The list `cntl` will have its elements incremented based on the integers present in the list `a`.
   - `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is set to 1.
   - The value of `n` should be such that the loop can execute at least once, meaning `n` must be at least 1.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect the initial values of `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
