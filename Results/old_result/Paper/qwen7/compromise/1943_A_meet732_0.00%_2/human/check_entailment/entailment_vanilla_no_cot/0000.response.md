Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob play optimally. Here’s why:

1. **Alice's and Bob's Moves**: Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, while Bob can only delete an element from `a`. The solution does not simulate these moves correctly.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves Alice trying to maximize the MEX, and Bob trying to minimize it. The current solution does not account for this strategic interaction between Alice and Bob.
3. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The solution does not construct the array `c` according to the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following points:

- Alice will always try to include the smallest missing number in `c`.
- Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing number.

Given the constraints, the optimal strategy can be derived as follows:
- If there are enough elements to form the sequence `[0, 1, 2, ..., k]` without conflict, the MEX will be `k+1`.

Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = [0] * n
        for i in a:
            cnt[i] += 1
        
        # Count how many numbers are missing from the sequence [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]
        mex = 0
        while mex < n and cnt[mex] > 0:
            mex += 1
        
        # If mex is less than n, Alice can always ensure the MEX is at least mex
        print(mex)

# Example usage:
func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It counts the occurrences of each number in `a`.
2. It determines the smallest missing number (`mex`) in the sequence `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
3. Since Alice can always ensure that the MEX is at least `mex`, the output is `mex`.

Thus, the provided solution is incorrect, and the correct answer is **False**.
