Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice can pick any element from the array `a` on her turn, and she appends it to her array `c`, whereas Bob only removes elements from `a`. The program incorrectly counts the occurrences of each number in `a` and determines the MEX based on these counts, without simulating the turns of Alice and Bob.

For instance, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

The correct simulation would be:
1. Alice picks `0`, `a` becomes `[0, 1]`, `c` becomes `[0]`.
2. Bob picks `0`, `a` becomes `[1]`, `c` remains `[0]`.
3. Alice picks `1`, `a` becomes `[]`, `c` becomes `[0, 1]`.

The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`.

However, the provided program will output `2` for this case, which is incorrect because it does not simulate the turns correctly. It simply counts the occurrences and determines the MEX, which does not reflect the optimal play strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
