You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s` made up of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in `s`, sums these counts, and prints the result. The function does not return any value but prints the sum of counts for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is the same as `n` in the problem statement) and a string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings**:
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s`.
   - It uses the `count` method of the string, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie".

### Problem Understanding

- A string is considered "ugly" if it contains either "map" or "pie".
- To make the string "beautiful", we need to remove the minimum number of characters such that no "map" or "pie" remains.

### Example Analysis

1. **Test Case 1**: `mmapnapie`
   - Contains "map" once and "pie" once.
   - Removing one 'm' and one 'e' makes it "mnap".
   - The program outputs `1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct.

2. **Test Case 2**: `azabazapi`
   - Does not contain "map" or "pie".
   - The program outputs `0 + 0 = 0`, which is correct.

3. **Test Case 3**: `mappppie`
   - Contains "map" once and "pie" once.
   - Removing one 'm', one 'a', one 'p', and one 'e' makes it "ppp".
   - The program outputs `1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct.

4. **Test Case 4**: `mapmapmapmapmapmap`
   - Contains "map" six times.
   - Removing all instances of "map" makes it an empty string.
   - The program outputs `6 + 0 = 6`, which is correct.

5. **Test Case 5**: `p`
   - Does not contain "map" or "pie".
   - The program outputs `0 + 0 = 0`, which is correct.

6. **Test Case 6**: `pppiepieeee`
   - Contains "pie" three times.
   - Removing one 'p', one 'i', one 'e', one 'p', one 'i', and one 'e' makes it "pp".
   - The program outputs `0 + 3 = 3`, but the correct answer should be `3` because only three characters need to be removed.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle cases where multiple overlapping substrings exist. It only counts non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". For instance, in the last test case, it incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `3`.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings.
