Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s` made up of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in `s`, sums these counts, and prints the result. The function does not return any value but prints the sum of counts for each test case.**
