You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a list of integers from the user input, counts the occurrences of each integer, and then calculates the sum of these counts divided by 3. The final result is printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks.
2. A regular polygon needs at least 3 sides of equal length.
3. The given program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
4. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
5. It then counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary.
6. Finally, it calculates the number of regular polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon needs at least 3 sides).

However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:
- The function `func_1()` is called without parameters, but it expects to read input values which are not provided within the function.
- The variable `t` is set to 1 before reading the actual value from input, which means the loop in the main part of the program will only run once, ignoring all other test cases.

To fix these issues, the program should correctly handle multiple test cases and pass the necessary inputs to `func_1()`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()  # Call the function for each test case

def func_1():
    n = int(input())  # Read the number of sticks
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the stick lengths
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3  # Calculate the number of polygons
    print(ans)  # Output the result
```

Given the above corrections, the original program does not correctly handle multiple test cases and does not pass the required inputs to `func_1()`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
