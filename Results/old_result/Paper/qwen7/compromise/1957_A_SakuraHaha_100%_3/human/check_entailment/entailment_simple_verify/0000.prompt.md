You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

t = 1
t = int(input())

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.

    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is the sum of counts of each integer in `a` divided by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of counts of each integer in list `a` divided by 3)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 3. This approach assumes that each polygon will always have three sides, but the problem allows for polygons with more than three sides (e.g., squares, pentagons, etc.). The program should consider the smallest possible polygon (triangle) for each stick length and then calculate how many such polygons can be formed.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
5
2 2 2 2 2
```

The correct output should be `2` because we can form two triangles (each side being 2 units), but the program will output `1` because it divides the count of 2 by 3, which results in 0 triangles plus 1 remainder.

To fix this, the program should iterate over possible polygon sides (from 3 up to the maximum stick length) and count how many complete polygons can be formed for each side length. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    
    # Iterate over possible polygon sides
    for side_length in range(3, max(cnt.keys()) + 1):
        total_sticks = sum(cnt.get(x, 0) for x in range(side_length, max(cnt.keys()) + 1, side_length))
        ans += total_sticks // side_length
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program considers all possible polygon sides and correctly counts the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.
