Output State: The output state will consist of integers representing the count of '0's in the substring `z` for each iteration of the loop. For each input integer `t`, the loop will process `t` lines of input. Each line will contain an integer `n` followed by a string `arr`. The program will find the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (variable `x`), the first occurrence of '1' from the end of `arr` (variable `y`), and then extract the substring `z` from `x` to `n-y`. Finally, it will count and print the number of '0's in `z`.
