Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input(''))` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. This integer is assigned to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are only defined within the context of each test case, which has not yet been executed. The precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 is preserved.
