Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program attempts to find the first and last positions of chips ('1') in the string representation of the array and then calculates the number of zeros ('0') between them. However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy to minimize the number of moves.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The program will output `1` because it finds the first '1' at index 1 and the last '1' at index 6, and there is one '0' between them. However, the optimal solution involves moving the chip at index 7 to index 5, which requires only 1 move, but the program does not consider this optimal path.

Another example is:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `2` as well, but the program does not handle the general case correctly for all inputs. For instance, if the chips are distributed such that the optimal solution involves moving multiple chips over several steps, the program's approach may not yield the minimum number of operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not always provide the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.
