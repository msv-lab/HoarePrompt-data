Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is set to 1 if the input string is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
   - `i` is set to 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the possible values of `mak` and the corresponding indices in the `pans` list.

### Case 1: Input String is '>'
- If the input string is '>', then `mak` is set to 1.
- Therefore, `pans[mak]` would refer to `pans[1]`.

### Case 2: Input String is Not '>'
- If the input string is not '>', then `mak` remains 0.
- Therefore, `pans[mak]` would refer to `pans[0]`.

Since the exact content of the `pans` list is not provided, let's denote the elements of `pans` as follows:
- Let `pans[0]` be `value0`.
- Let `pans[1]` be `value1`.

Given that `i` is 2, `pans[i]` would refer to `pans[2]`, which we'll denote as `value2`.

### Printing Statement Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string followed by four values: `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.
- Since `i` is 2, `pans[i]` will always be `value2`.

### Final Output:
- If the input string is '>', the output will be: `'?', value1, value1, value2, value2`.
- If the input string is not '>', the output will be: `'?', value0, value0, value2, value2`.

Since the exact values of `value0`, `value1`, and `value2` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their positions in the `pans` list.

Output: **'?', pans[1], pans[1], pans[2], pans[2]** if the input string is '>', or **'?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[2], pans[2]** if the input string is not '>'
