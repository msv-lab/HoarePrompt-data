Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `i`
   - `i` must be at least 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - The input is less than 0 (current value of the input is '<')

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it equal to `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should now be `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `mak` remains the same as it was set to `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now `n`.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - The input remains less than 0.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `mak` is `i`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, and the input is less than 0 (current value of the input is '<')**
