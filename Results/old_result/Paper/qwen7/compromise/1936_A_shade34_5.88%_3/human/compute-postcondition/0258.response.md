Output State: **`mak` is equal to `2n - 1`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive, and `i` is equal to the length of `pans`, which is `2n - 1`.**

In Natural Language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `mak` will be set to `2n - 1`, `mak2` will be `n - 1`, and `pans` will contain all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive. The variable `i` will also be equal to the length of `pans`, which is `2n - 1`. This is because the loop processes each element in the permutation through a series of comparisons and updates, ultimately leading to the final state described.
