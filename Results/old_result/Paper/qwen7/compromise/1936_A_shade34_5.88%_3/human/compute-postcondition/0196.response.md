Output State: **`mak` is `len(pans) + n - 1`, `mak2` is `len(pans) + n - 1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`, `s` contains the final input string received, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, and `len(pans)` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the current value of `mak` to `mak2`. Since `mak` was previously calculated as `len(pans) + n - 1`, `mak2` now also holds this value. All other variables (`i`, `pans`, `s`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
