Output State: **`sys.stdout.flush()` is executed, `s` is '=', `pans` contains the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since no specific value for `i` was given, it is assumed to be the last value appended or referenced. The initial conditions of `sys.stdout.flush()` being executed and `s` being '=' remain unchanged.
