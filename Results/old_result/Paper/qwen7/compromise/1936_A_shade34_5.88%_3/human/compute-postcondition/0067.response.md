Output State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The precondition that `len(pans)` must be at least 2 is still valid, but since no changes were made to `pans`, it is not explicitly updated in the output state.
