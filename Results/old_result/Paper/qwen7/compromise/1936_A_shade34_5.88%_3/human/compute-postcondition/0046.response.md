Output State: **`s` is a new string input from the user, `mak` is undefined, `pans` is a list containing the value `k + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is `k + 1`) to the list `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
