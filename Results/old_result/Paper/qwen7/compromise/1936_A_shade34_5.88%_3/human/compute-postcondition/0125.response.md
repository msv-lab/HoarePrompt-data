Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between `0` and `n-2`, inclusive.
   - `i` is either in the list `pans` (if `s == '<'`) or is `n-1` (if `s != '<'`).
   - `pans` contains either `[i]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`).
   - `s` is an input string, and its current value is either `<` or `=`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs for each value of `i` from `0` to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `s == '<'`, then `i` will be in the list `pans` and `pans` will contain `[i]`.
   - If `s != '<'`, then `i` will be `n-1` and `pans` will contain the element `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `mak2` remains unchanged as it is equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` remains unchanged as it is either `n-1` or any value between `0` and `n-2`, inclusive.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `pans` will change based on the value of `s`:
     - If `s == '<'`, `pans` will contain `[i]`.
     - If `s != '<'`, `pans` will contain the element `n`.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is either `<` or `=`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is either in the list `pans` (if `s == '<'`) or is `n-1` (if `s != '<'`), `pans` contains either `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`), `s` is an input string, and its current value is either `<` or `=`.**
