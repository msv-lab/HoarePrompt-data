Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a new string input from the user.
   - If `s` equals `<`, then:
     - `mak` is `k + 1`.
     - `pans` is `[i]`.
     - `i` is `k + 1`.
     - `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.
   - Otherwise:
     - `mak` is undefined.
     - `pans` is a list containing the value `k + 1`.
     - `i` is `k + 1`.
     - `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Regardless of whether `s` equals `<` or not, the value of `i` will be incremented by 1 (since `i` starts from 0 and increments in each iteration).
   - `n` remains the same as it was before the previous iteration.
   - `pans` and `mak` will be adjusted based on the condition, but they are not part of the loop head and thus do not affect the loop continuation directly.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` was `k` before, it will now be `k + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a new string input from the user, `mak` is undefined, `pans` is a list containing the value `k + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.**
