Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is either in the list `pans` (if `s == '<'`) or is `n-1` (if `s != '<'`), `pans` contains either `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`), `s` is an input string, and its current value is either `<` or `=`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values but ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
