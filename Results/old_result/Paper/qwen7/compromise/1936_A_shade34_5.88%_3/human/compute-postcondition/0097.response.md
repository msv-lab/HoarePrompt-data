Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is defined as `i + 1`.
   - `i` is at least 2.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - The input is less than 0 (current value of the input is '<').

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - Since `i` is at least 2, let's assume the smallest possible value for `i`, which is 2.
     - Therefore, `mak = i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - The values of `mak` and `i` are both 3 and 2 respectively.

4. **Construct the Print Statement Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak` and `i` twice.
   - So, the output will be: `'?, 3, 3, 2, 2'`.

Output: **'? 3 3 2 2'**
