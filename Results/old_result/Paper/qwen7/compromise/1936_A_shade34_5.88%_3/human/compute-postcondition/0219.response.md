Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the new string input by the user, `mak` is `i` if the new `s` equals '<', otherwise `mak` is the same as before, `pans` is a list containing the value `i` appended to itself.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `pans` was initially a list containing the value `i` (if `s` equals '<') or a list with the value `i` appended to it (if `s` does not equal '<'), appending `i` again results in a list that contains `i` twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
