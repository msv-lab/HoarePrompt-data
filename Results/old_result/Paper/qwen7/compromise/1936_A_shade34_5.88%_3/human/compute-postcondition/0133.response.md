Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is either added to the list `pans` or remains as it was (if `s != '<'`), `pans` contains either `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`), `s` is assigned the value of the input string, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.
