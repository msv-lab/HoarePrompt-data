Output State: **`mak` is equal to `i`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is either in the list `pans` (if `s == '<'`) or is `n-1` (if `s != '<'`), `pans` contains either `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`), `s` is assigned the value of the input string, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` updates the value of `mak` to be equal to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
