Postcondition: `s` is a new string input from the user, `mak` is either `k + 1` or undefined, `pans` is a list containing the value `k + 1` and possibly `i`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration. If `s` equals '<', `mak` is set to `k + 1` and `pans` contains `i`. If `s` does not equal '<', `mak` remains undefined, and `pans` contains `k + 1`. Additionally, if `s` equals '=', `pans` will contain `i`.
