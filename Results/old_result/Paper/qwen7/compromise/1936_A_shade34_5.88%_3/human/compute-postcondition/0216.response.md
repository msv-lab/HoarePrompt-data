Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the new string input by the user, `mak` is `i` if the new `s` equals '<', otherwise `mak` is the same as before, `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if the new `s` equals '<', otherwise `pans` is a list with the value `i` appended to it.**

This means that the variable `s` has been updated to the new string input by the user, while the other variables retain their previous values or conditions based on the new value of `s`.
