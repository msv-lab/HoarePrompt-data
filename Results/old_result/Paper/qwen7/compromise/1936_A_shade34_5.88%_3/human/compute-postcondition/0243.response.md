Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(pans)`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive.
   - The input received is '>', as it has been evaluated to be equal to '>'.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - Therefore, `len(pans)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `len(pans)` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `pans` remains a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive.
   - The input received is still '>', as it has been evaluated to be equal to '>'.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive, and the input received is '>'**.
