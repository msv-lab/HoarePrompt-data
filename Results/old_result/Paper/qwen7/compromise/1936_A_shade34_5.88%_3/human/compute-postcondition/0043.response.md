Output State: **`s` is a new string input from the user, `mak` is undefined, `pans` is undefined, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before the previous iteration**.

This means that the variable `s` has been updated to hold a new string input from the user, while `mak`, `pans`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states.
