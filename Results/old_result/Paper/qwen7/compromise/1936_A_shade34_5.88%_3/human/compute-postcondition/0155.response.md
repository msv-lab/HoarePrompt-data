Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` must have at least 2 elements.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to `mak`. Since `mak2` was previously equal to `mak`, `mak2` also becomes `n-1`. The values of `i` and `pans` remain unchanged.
