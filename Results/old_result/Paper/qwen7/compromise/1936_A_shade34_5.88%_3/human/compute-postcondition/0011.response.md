Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `mak` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The input received is a string equal to '<', and the length of the string is 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mak` is 1, `i` is 2**
