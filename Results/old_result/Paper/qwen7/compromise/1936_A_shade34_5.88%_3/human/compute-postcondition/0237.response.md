Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `pans` is a list starting from `n` and ending at `2n - 1`.

However, the code snippet includes `pans[mak]`, where `mak` is not defined in the initial state. Since `mak` is not defined, we cannot determine its value directly from the given information. Therefore, we need to assume that `mak` refers to some index within the range of the list `pans`.

Given that `pans` contains all integers from `n` to `2n - 1`, let's denote the elements of `pans` as follows:
- `pans[0] = n`
- `pans[1] = n + 1`
- ...
- `pans[n-1] = 2n - 1`

Since `i` is 1, `pans[i]` would be the second element of the list, which is `n + 1`.

The print statement will output four parts:
1. `'?'` (a string literal).
2. `pans[mak]` (an element of the list `pans` at index `mak`).
3. `pans[mak]` (repeated, same as the second part).
4. `pans[i]` (which is `n + 1`).

Since `mak` is not specified, we can only describe it as an index within the range of the list `pans`. Let's denote the element at index `mak` as `pans[mak]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] n + 1'**
