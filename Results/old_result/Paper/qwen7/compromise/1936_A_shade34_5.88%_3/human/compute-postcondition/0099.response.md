Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and the input is less than 0 (current value of the input is '<').**

The code `mak = i` updates the value of `mak` to be equal to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `i` is at least 2 and `n` is at least 2, along with the input being less than 0, are still valid.
