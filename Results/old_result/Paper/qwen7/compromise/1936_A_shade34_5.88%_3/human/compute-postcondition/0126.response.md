Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive.
   - `i` is either in the list `pans` (if `s == '<'`) or is `n-1` (if `s != '<'`).
   - `pans` contains either `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`).
   - `s` is an input string with a current value of either `<` or `=`.

2. **Values of Variables:**
   - Since `mak` can be either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, let's denote it as `mak = k` where `k` is one of these values.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so `mak2 = k`.
   - If `s == '<'`, then `i` is in the list `pans` and `pans` contains `[i+1]`. If `s != '<'`, then `i` is `n-1` and `pans` contains `n`.
   - Therefore, if `s == '<'`, `i` is some value such that `i+1` is in `pans`, and if `s != '<'`, `i` is `n-1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.
   - Given that `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the print statement will output `?` followed by `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the print statement will output `?` followed by `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `mak` again.
   - The exact values of `mak` and `i` depend on the conditions described but are consistent with the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak]**
