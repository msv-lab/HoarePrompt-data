Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(pans))`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `pans`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will start when `i` is set to 1 and continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(pans)` must be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the initial state**: We need to ensure that `pans` has at least one element, and `i` starts from 1.

Given the initial state:
- `mak` is 0
- All other variables (`pans`, `mak2`, `t`, `n`, `i`) retain their initial values

We need to adjust the states of `pans` and `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `pans` must have at least one element.
- `i` must be 1.

So, the final state is:
**`mak` is 0, `pans` must have at least one element, `i` is 1**.
