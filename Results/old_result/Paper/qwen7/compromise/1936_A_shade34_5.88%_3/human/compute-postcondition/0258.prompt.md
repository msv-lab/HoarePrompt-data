Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, based on the problem description, t (the number of test cases) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n (the size of the permutation) is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Additionally, the permutation p is a list of n integers that is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mak` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is equal to the length of `pans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mak` is `n + 1`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans)`, `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`, `s` contains the final input string received, no changes were made to the variables due to `sys.stdout.flush()`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to the length of `pans`, which is `2n - 1`, `mak` is equal to `2n - 1`, and `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive. The value of `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called for each iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
