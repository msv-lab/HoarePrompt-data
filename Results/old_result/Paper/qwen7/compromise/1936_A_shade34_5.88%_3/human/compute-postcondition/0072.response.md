Output State: **`mak` is 1 if the input string is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0; `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified or referenced within this line of code, the values of `mak` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
