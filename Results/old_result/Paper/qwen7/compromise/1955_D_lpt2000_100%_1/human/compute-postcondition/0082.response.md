Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is now greater than or equal to -1, `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged and is less than or equal to 0, `m` remains unchanged, `fnd` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `in_aa` remains unchanged, `out_aa` remains unchanged, `aa` remains unchanged, `bb` remains unchanged, `cnt_aa` remains unchanged, `cnt_bb` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. Since `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than or equal to 0, after decrementing by 1, it will now be greater than or equal to -1. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
