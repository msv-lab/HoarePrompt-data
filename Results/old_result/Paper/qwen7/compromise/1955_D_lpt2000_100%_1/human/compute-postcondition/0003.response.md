Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `aa` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `aa` by splitting a string input using `input().split()`, which converts each element into a string. The original values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the condition on `nabors` remain unchanged.
