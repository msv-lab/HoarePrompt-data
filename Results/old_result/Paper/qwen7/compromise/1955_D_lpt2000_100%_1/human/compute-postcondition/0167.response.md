Postcondition: **`D` is a Counter object counting the intersection of elements in `aa` and `bb`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is `cnt_bb - D`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split by spaces, `aa` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input split by spaces, `bb` is a list of strings from the new input split by spaces, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D >= k` else 0. If `C[in_aa] > 0` and `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 3 and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `fnd` is set to 0. `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**
