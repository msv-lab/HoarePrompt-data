Postcondition: **`D` is a Counter object counting the intersection of elements in `aa` and `bb`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is `cnt_bb - D`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split by spaces, `aa` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input split by spaces, `bb` is a list of strings from the new input split by spaces, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D >= k` else 0, `aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element. The current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0.**
