Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all its iterations will be as follows:

- `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`.
- `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`.
- `m` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches the length of `aa`.
- `k` is an integer.
- `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D + 1` (if `C[in_aa]` was positive) or `pairs_in_D` (if `C[in_aa]` was not positive) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.
- For each pair `(in_aa, out_aa)` processed in the loop, `out_aa`'s count in `D` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `C[in_aa]` was positive, otherwise `out_aa`'s count in `E` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was positive.
- `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was not positive.
- `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`.
- The loop processes all possible pairs in the list `aa` starting from index `m` to the end of the list, and `fnd` is updated based on the condition involving `pairs_in_D`.

In essence, after all iterations, `D` will contain the final intersection counts, `E` will reflect the differences, `m` will be adjusted to cover the entire list `aa`, and `fnd` will indicate whether the condition involving `pairs_in_D` was met at any point during the iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: All variables will reach their final states after the loop has executed all its iterations. Here's a description of the final state:

- `D`: A Counter object where each key is an index from the list `aa` and the value is the net count of how many times that index has been incremented or decremented throughout the loop. The values will range based on the operations performed during the loop but will stabilize after all iterations.
- `E`: A Counter object similar to `D`, but representing the remaining counts before any decrementing occurs. The values will reflect the net effect of increments and decrements as per the conditions in the loop.
- `m`: Will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates over all elements in the slice `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` until there are no more elements to process.
- `fnd`: Will be the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was found to be greater than or equal to `k` after all iterations.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `aa`.
- `in_aa` and `out_aa`: Will be the last pair of elements processed in the loop, which are the last elements in the slices `aa[m+1:]` and `aa[:n - (m + 1)]` respectively.
- `aa` and `bb`: Remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`: These will be the final Counters representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa` and the entire list `bb` respectively.
- `pairs_in_D`: The sum of the values in `D` after all iterations.
- `C`: A Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, reflecting the net changes made to `cnt_bb` during the loop.

The exact numerical values for `D`, `E`, and `C` will depend on the specific operations performed during the loop based on the input data and the value of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: All the variables will retain their final values after the loop has executed all its iterations. Specifically, `D` will contain the final count of intersections between elements in `aa` and `bb` as per the loop's operations, `cnt_aa` will remain unchanged as it was initialized with the first `m` elements of `aa`, `E` will reflect the differences between `cnt_aa` and `D` after all iterations, `C` will represent `cnt_bb - D` post-loop execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` will stay as they were provided initially, `aa` and `bb` will retain their list of strings as given, `cnt_bb` will hold the final count of elements in `bb`, `pairs_in_D` will be the total sum of the values in `D` after all iterations, and `fnd` will be 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0. The loop head and body variables (`in_aa`, `out_aa`, `C`, `D`, `E`) will have been updated according to the loop's logic, but their final values will be part of the overall state after the loop completes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
