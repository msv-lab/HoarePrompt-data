Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is adjusted based on the condition (increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` >= `k`, otherwise decreased by 1); `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

This means that `fnd` is incremented by 1 only if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `fnd` remains the same. All other variables (`E[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `pairs_in_D`, `C[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, and `C[in_aa]`) undergo the specified changes based on the condition.
