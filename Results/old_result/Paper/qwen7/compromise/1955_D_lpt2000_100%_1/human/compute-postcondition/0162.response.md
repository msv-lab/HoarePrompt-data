Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 3 and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `fnd` is set to 0; `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is still greater than 0.**

This means that the `pairs_in_D` variable has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` remain the same as before, and `fnd` has been set to 0. The value of `C[in_aa]` is still greater than 0.
