Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pairs_in_D += 1` increments the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, while `E[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `D[in_aa]` retain their initial changes.
