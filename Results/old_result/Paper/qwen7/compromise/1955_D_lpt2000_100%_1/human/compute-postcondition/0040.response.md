Postcondition: **`D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `m` is an integer and `m` is increased by 1; `k` is an integer; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` (the sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; if `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `fnd` is increased by 1 and `out_aa`'s count in `D` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged and `out_aa`'s count in `E` is increased by 1.**
