You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the subsequent logic to determine the number of additional screens required is flawed.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

- For the input `(x, y) = (12, 4)`, the program should calculate the following:
  - `space_x = 12 * 1 = 12`
  - `space_y = 4 * 4 = 16`
  - `total_space = 16 + 12 = 28`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 is even, this part is correct)
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 3 - 16 = 39 - 16 = 23`
  - Since `space_x = 12` and `remaining_cells = 23`, the program should determine how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 12 cells. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of extra screens needed.

The program logic for calculating `extra_screen` is incorrect. It should ensure that the remaining cells are distributed across the minimum number of screens. The current logic does not correctly handle the distribution of remaining cells.

For instance, in the given example, the program should correctly determine that 2 screens are needed (one for the 4 `2x2` icons and one for the remaining 12 `1x1` icons). However, the current implementation might incorrectly calculate the number of extra screens needed.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
