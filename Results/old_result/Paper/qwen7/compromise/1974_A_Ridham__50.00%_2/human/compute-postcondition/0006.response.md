Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each `t`, two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The function processes these test cases and returns different outputs based on the values of `x` and `y`.**

However, since the specific output logic is not provided in the given information, the exact return value cannot be detailed. The function likely evaluates `x` and `y` for each test case defined by `t` and returns a result based on those values.
