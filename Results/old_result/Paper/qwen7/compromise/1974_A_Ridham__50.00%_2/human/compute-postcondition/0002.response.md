State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, but this is just a placeholder and does not affect the initial state. The key variable here is `n`, which controls the number of iterations in the loop.

2. Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run even once.

3. List the relevant states: We need to ensure that the loop can execute, so we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0. The other variables (`t` and `result`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, while keeping the other variables in their given states.
