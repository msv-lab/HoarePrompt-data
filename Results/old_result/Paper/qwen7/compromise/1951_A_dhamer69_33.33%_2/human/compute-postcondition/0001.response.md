State right before the while loop, the variables are as follows:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`
- `t` is an input integer.

For the loop `while t > 0:` to execute the first time, the condition `t > 0` must be true. Given that `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Since no other variables in the loop head (`t`) need adjustment, we only need to ensure that `t` meets the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
