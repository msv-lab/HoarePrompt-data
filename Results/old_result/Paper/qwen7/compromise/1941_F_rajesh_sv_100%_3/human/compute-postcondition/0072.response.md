Output State: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`. After all iterations of the loop, `l` will be the greatest index such that `D[l] + f` is less than or equal to `right`, and `h` will be the smallest index such that `D[h] + f` is greater than `right`. The variable `mid` will be the midpoint calculated during the last iteration of the loop, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be the sums of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively.

This means that the loop has narrowed down the range within the sorted list `D` where the condition `D[l] + f <= right` holds true, and `D[h] + f > right` does not hold true. The final values of `l` and `h` effectively define the boundary around the value that satisfies the condition closest to `right - f`.
