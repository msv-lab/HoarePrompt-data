Postcondition: `total` is 0, `mid` is either `l + (h - l) // 2` or `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1`, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are defined as per their respective conditions within the if and else blocks. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` is set to `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1` and `mid_sum` is undefined while `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Otherwise, `mid` remains `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `h` is updated to `mid`.
