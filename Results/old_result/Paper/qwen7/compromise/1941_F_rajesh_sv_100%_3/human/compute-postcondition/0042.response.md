Output State: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A` from index 1 to `n-1`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found under the same conditions, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, and `i` is `n`. `diff` is the last calculated difference which is `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_diff` will hold the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in the array `A` starting from the second element, `next_max_diff` will hold the second largest such difference, `index` will point to the index where `max_diff` was found (if there were any differences), and `i` will be equal to `n` (the total number of elements in the array). The variable `diff` will contain the difference between the last two elements of the array `A`.
