Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`**.

This means that the variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` have been assigned new values based on the current value of `D[mid]`, `D[mid + 1]`, and `f`. The values of `mid`, `h`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states, as the code snippet only assigns new values to `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`.
