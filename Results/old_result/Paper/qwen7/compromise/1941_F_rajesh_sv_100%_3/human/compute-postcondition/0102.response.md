Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either `mid + 1` or remains less than `mid`, `h` is either `mid` or is updated to `mid`, `ans` is set based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It states that `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain as `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. Depending on the condition inside the if statement, `l` will either be updated to `mid + 1` or remain less than `mid`, and `h` will either stay as `mid` or be updated to `mid`. The variable `ans` is set based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`, and `mid` is always updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`.
