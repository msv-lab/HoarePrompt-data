Output State: `total` is 0, `mid` is the final midpoint value after all iterations, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are the sums of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively, `l` and `h` are equal to each other and represent the final boundaries of the search range, `f` is the final value from the sequence `F` that caused the loop to exit, and `ans` holds the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop has narrowed down the search range to a single midpoint (`l == h`), and `mid` represents this final midpoint. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are based on the final `mid` value. The variable `f` has been updated to its final value, indicating the end of the loop. The variable `ans` keeps track of the minimum value found during the entire process, ensuring it reflects the best possible outcome of the loop's iterations.
