Postcondition: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is unchanged, `h` is now `mid`, `f` is the next value in `F`, the current value of `mid_sum - left` is less than the current value of `right - mid_next_sum`.
