Output State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is now `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, and `h` and `l` are equal to each other representing the final boundaries of the search range. The current value of `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values. The condition that `h` and `l` are equal to each other still holds true, and the inequality involving `mid_sum`, `left`, `right`, and `mid_next_sum` also remains valid.
