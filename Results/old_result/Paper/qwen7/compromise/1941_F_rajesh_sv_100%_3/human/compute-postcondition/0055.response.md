Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `mid`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`, and `(mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum)`**.

Explanation: The line `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The condition `(mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum)` also remains valid as no changes were made to `mid_sum`, `left`, `right`, or `mid_next_sum`.
