Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; `total` is 0; `mid` is the final midpoint where the loop exits; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` and `h` are equal to each other, representing the final boundaries of the search range, and the condition `l == h` is true.**

This means that the variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or final states.
