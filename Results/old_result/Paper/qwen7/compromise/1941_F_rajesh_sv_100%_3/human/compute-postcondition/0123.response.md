Output State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is equal to `l`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is defined as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` and `h` are equal to each other, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, the updated state of the variables is as stated above.
