Output State: **`i` is 5, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`**

The code updates the variable `diff` to the value of `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 4, after the execution of the line `diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1 (becoming 5) and `diff` is set to `A[5] - A[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
