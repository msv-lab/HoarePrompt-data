Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

The variable `diff` will contain the difference between the last two elements of the array `A`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes three lists: A, D, and F. It first finds the maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the second maximum difference (`next_max_diff`) between consecutive elements in list A. Then, for each element in list F, it uses binary search to find pairs of elements in list D that, when adjusted by the current element from F, form a valid pair within certain constraints. Finally, it prints the maximum value among `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and the minimum adjustments found during the search process.

    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `testcases` must be greater than 2. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `testcases` is greater than 0, and it specifically mentions that after 3 iterations, `testcases` must be greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to complete all its iterations, `testcases` must initially be greater than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving four lists (a, d, f) and three integers (n, m, k). It ensures that the variable `testcases` is greater than 2 after completing all iterations of the loop. The function does not return any value but modifies the state of predefined lists and integers based on the specified conditions.
