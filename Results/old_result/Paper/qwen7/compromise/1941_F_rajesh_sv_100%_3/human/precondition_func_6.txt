(n, m, k) are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 × 10^5. A is a list of n strictly increasing integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems, D is a list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models after sorting, and F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions.
