Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 's[4]s[4]' + 's[4]' * 2, `x` is 4, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by appending `s[x] * 2` to it. Given that `x` is 4, `s[x]` is `s[4]`, and multiplying it by 2 results in `s[4]s[4]`. Therefore, `ans` changes from `'s[4]s[4]'` to `'s[4]s[4]' + 's[4]s[4]'`, which simplifies to `'s[4]s[4]s[4]s[4]'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
