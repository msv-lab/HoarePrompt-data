Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `x` is 2, `ans` is 's[0]*2' + 's[1]*2' + 's[2]*2'**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends `s[x] * 2` to the existing value of `ans`. Given that `x` is 2, `ans` was initially `'s[0]*2' + 's[1]*2'`, so after executing the code, `ans` becomes `'s[0]*2' + 's[1]*2' + 's[2]*2'`. The values of `n`, `j`, and `x` remain unchanged.
