Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and os.system('cls') has been called.**

The command `os.system('cls')` clears the terminal or command prompt screen. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `t` or `n`. Therefore, the value range for `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is not affected by this command.
