You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where each key (an integer from the list `a`) has its value incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that key in the list `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where each key (an integer from the list `a`) has its value incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that key in the list `a`, the loop has executed all iterations but no specific value returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (each less than `n`). For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then determines and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either `cnt[i] == 1` (indicating `i` appears exactly once in the list `a`) or `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2. If no such integer is found, the function returns the last integer `i` processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Here’s why:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`. She should always pick the smallest available number that ensures the MEX remains high. However, the current implementation does not consider this optimal strategy.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob aims to minimize the MEX of the array `c`. He should pick numbers in such a way that the MEX is minimized. The current implementation does not consider this either.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4
  0 0 1 1
  ```

- **Expected Output**: `2`

- **Actual Output**:
  The provided code will output `1` instead of `2`.

Here's a breakdown of the game according to the optimal strategy:

1. **Alice's First Move**: Alice can pick `0` (the smallest available number).
   - `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
   
2. **Bob's First Move**: Bob can pick `0` (the next smallest available number).
   - `a = [0, 1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
   
3. **Alice's Second Move**: Alice can pick `1` (the next smallest available number).
   - `a = [1, 1]`, `c = [0, 1]`.
   
4. **Bob's Second Move**: Bob can pick `1` (the only remaining number).
   - `a = []`, `c = [0, 1]`.

The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`, which matches the expected output.

However, the provided code does not simulate this optimal strategy. Instead, it simply counts how many times each number appears and returns the first number that appears exactly once or when the count of a number becomes zero. This approach does not guarantee the optimal MEX value.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus is incorrect.
