Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` using a dictionary (`cnt`). However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1()` does not correctly simulate the game's rules and does not compute the MEX of the array `c` as required. Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Rules Not Followed**: 
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements, but the program does not simulate these turns.
   - Alice picks any element from `a` and appends it to `c`, then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks any element from `a` and removes it without appending to `c`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The program tries to find the smallest integer `i` such that `cnt[i] == 1` or `t` (which is not properly defined in the context of the game) is greater than or equal to 2. This does not reflect the actual game process and the MEX calculation.

3. **Output Based on Counting**:
   - The program outputs the smallest integer `i` based on the count of occurrences, which is not relevant to the game's outcome or the MEX of the final array `c`.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus cannot produce the correct MEX value for the final array `c`.

Correctness: **False**
