Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the size of the array `N`.
   - It reads the elements of the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through the range `[0, N)` to check how many unique elements have exactly one occurrence (`cnt[i] == 1`).
   - If at any point, the count of such unique elements reaches 2 or more, or if there is no occurrence of a particular index `i`, it returns `i`.

### Problem Description and Requirements

- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice can only pick elements that still exist in `a`.
  - Bob can pick any element from `a` without restrictions.
  - Alice starts first.
  - The game ends when `a` is empty.
  - The score is the MEX of the array `c` formed by Alice's choices.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - She should try to ensure that as many small numbers as possible are included in `c`.

2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - He should try to remove elements that could potentially be the MEX.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will always pick the smallest available number that hasn't been picked yet.
   - Bob will always pick the largest available number to reduce the potential MEX.

### Issues in the Given Program

- **Counting Unique Elements**: The current logic counts the occurrences of each element but does not simulate the actual game play.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the first `i` where either condition is met, which does not align with the game rules.
- **Simulating Game Play**: The function does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not build the array `c` as per the game rules.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game play and keep track of the choices made by Alice and Bob. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

```python
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize counters
    alice_choices = []
    bob_choices = []
    
    i = 0
    j = 0
    
    while i < N and j < N:
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
            if a[i] not in bob_choices:
                alice_choices.append(a[i])
                a.pop(i)
                i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        else:  # Bob's turn
            if a[j] not in alice_choices:
                bob_choices.append(a[j])
                a.pop(j)
                j += 1
            else:
                j += 1
    
    # Calculate MEX of Alice's choices
    mex = 0
    seen = set(alice_choices)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    
    return mex

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly simulate the game and does not return the correct MEX value. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
