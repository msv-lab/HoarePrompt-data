#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where each key (an integer from the list `a`) has its value incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that key in the list `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where each key (an integer from the list `a`) has its value incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that key in the list `a`, the loop has executed all iterations but no specific value returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (each less than `n`). For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then determines and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either `cnt[i] == 1` (indicating `i` appears exactly once in the list `a`) or `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2. If no such integer is found, the function returns the last integer `i` processed.
