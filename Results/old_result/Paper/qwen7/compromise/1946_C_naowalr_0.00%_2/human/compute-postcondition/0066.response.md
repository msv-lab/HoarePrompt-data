Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has run `n-1` times. After these iterations, `i` will be `0` (since it starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `n-1` and then stops). For each pair of integers `(a, b)` read from standard input, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` now contain both `b` and `a`, respectively. All adjacency list entries are bidirectional, indicating a fully constructed undirected graph with `n` nodes.
