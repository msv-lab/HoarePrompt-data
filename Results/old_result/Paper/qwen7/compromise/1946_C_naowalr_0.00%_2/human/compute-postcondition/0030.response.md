Postcondition: **`numCuts` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers from inputs, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other, forming an undirected graph, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1). If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then no changes are made. Otherwise, `R` is updated to the integer value of `(L + x) // 2`.**
