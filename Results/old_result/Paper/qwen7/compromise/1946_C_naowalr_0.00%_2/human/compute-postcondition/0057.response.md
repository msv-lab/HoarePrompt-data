Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `range(n - 1)`, meaning it will iterate from `0` to `n-2`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin.
   - There is an adjacency list entry for `b` that now includes `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates from `0` to `n-2`, if the loop has just completed its previous iteration, `i` would be `n-2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n-1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `a` and `b` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is updated to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is the same as before**.
