Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The states of the other variables are not affected.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value read from standard input, constrained within the range 1 to 10^4, while the other variables remain in their initial undefined state.
