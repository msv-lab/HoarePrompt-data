Output State: **The loop will execute `n-1` times. After all iterations, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` will be `n-1`, `a` will be the integer value of the first input, `b` will be the integer value of the second input, and for every pair `(a, b)` provided as input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, forming an undirected graph where each node is connected to every other node exactly once. `L` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `L` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or the adjacency list `adj`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
