Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is less than `x - 1`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

This means that `x` is now set to the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. All other variables retain their initial conditions or the results from the function call.
