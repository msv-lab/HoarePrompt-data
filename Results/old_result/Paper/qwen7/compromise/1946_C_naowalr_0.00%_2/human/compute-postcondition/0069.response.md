Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has run `n-1` times. After these iterations, `i` is `0`. For each pair of integers `(a, b)` read from standard input, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` now contain both `b` and `a`, respectively. All adjacency list entries are bidirectional, indicating a fully constructed undirected graph with `n` nodes; `L` is set to `1`; `R` is set to `100001`; `numCuts` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `numCuts` to `0`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, or the structure of the graph. Therefore, the output state retains the information from the initial state except for the new value of `numCuts`.
