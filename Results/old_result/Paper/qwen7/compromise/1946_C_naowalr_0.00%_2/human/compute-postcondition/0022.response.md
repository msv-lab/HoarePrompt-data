Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers from inputs, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other, forming an undirected graph, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`, which calculates the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `x` will be `50001`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
