Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers from inputs, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other, forming an undirected graph, `L` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is 100001, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1), and either `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`).**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `L` to be the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`. Since `L` was initially 1 and `R` is 100001, `L` now becomes the integer value of `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which is 50001. All other variables remain unchanged.
