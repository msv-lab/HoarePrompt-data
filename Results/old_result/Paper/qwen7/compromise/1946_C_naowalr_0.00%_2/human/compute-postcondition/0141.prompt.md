Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` remains `t`, `n` is the total number of unique integers entered (plus one), `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list except for the entries that contain the connections between the nodes as specified by the input, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`). Otherwise, `L` remains 1, `R` remains 100001, `x` remains 50001, `numCuts` remains as is, and `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `numCuts` is 0; if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is `x`; otherwise, `R` is `x`; `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is `x`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `numCuts` remains 0, `L` is `x`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. Otherwise, `numCuts` remains 0, `L` is less than `x - 1`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
