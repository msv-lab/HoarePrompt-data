Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is 50001, `adj` is a bidirectional adjacency list with `n` nodes, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `x` as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the expression `(L + R) // 2` evaluates to `50001`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
