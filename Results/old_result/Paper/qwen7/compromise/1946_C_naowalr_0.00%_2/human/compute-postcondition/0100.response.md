Output State: **`z` is `t`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list of lists named `adj` with `n + 1` elements, where each element is an empty list. This does not affect the values of `z`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `adj` is created and initialized as specified.
