Output State: **`x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

In this case, the code assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to the variable `x`. The initial state only provides the assignment of `x`, and no specific values for `L` and `R` are given. Therefore, the output state simply reflects that `x` is now equal to the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2.
