Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will eventually become false, meaning `R` and `L` converge to the same value, which is 50001 in this case. At this point, the loop terminates. The value of `x` will be the last computed midpoint, which is also 50001. Since the loop exits when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, it means the final decision is based on whether `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`). Given the conditions provided, if the loop exits with `R` set to 50001, it implies that the final value of `x` (which is 50001) satisfies the condition for `R` to be updated to `x`, indicating that `numCuts` is likely equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` at this point.
