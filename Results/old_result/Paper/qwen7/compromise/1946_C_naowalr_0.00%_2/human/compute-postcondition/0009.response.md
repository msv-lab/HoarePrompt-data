Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first input, `b` is the integer value of the second input, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`. This means `a` and `b` are now holding the integer values of the first and second inputs, respectively. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 1 remains unchanged. Additionally, `adj[b]` is updated to contain the value `[a]`.
