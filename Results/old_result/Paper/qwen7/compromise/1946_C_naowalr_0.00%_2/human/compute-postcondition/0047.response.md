Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` becomes false because `L` and `R` converge to the same value, which is 50001. The loop terminates here. The final values of `L` and `R` are both 50001, indicating that the search range has narrowed down to a single value. Since `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the loop and does not change based on the conditions inside the loop, it stays at 0. The value of `x` used in the last iteration of the loop is also 50001, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is not specified but remains consistent with the previous outputs.
