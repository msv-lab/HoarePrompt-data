Output State: `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes, the value of `L` and `R` converge to 50001 because the condition `R - L > 1` eventually becomes false when `L` and `R` are equal. The variable `x` is the midpoint of `L` and `R`, which also becomes 50001. Since the loop exits when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, it implies that `numCuts` does not change from its initial value of 0, and `leftover` retains its value from the last call to `dfs(1, 1)`.
