Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers from inputs, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other, forming an undirected graph, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `a` and `b`, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]`, `L`, `R`, and `x` remain unchanged.
