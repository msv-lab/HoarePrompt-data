Output State: **`numCuts` is 0; `L` is `x`; `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The line `L = x` assigns the value of `x` to the variable `L`. The initial values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged. Therefore, `numCuts` is still 0, `L` is now `x`, and `leftover` is still the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
