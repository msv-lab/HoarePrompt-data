Output State: **`numCuts` is 0; `R` is `x`; `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The variable `R` is assigned the value of `x`. The initial values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged. The function call `dfs(1, 1)` is evaluated but its result is stored in `leftover` before the assignment to `R`.
