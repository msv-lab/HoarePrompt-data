Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first input, `b` is the integer value of the second input, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value `[a]`, which means the list `adj[a]` was empty. After executing the code, `adj[a]` will contain both `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
