Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current values of variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `R` is 100001.
   - `L` is 1.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `R - L` must be greater than 1.
   - Currently, `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1.
   
4. **Check if any adjustments are needed**:
   - Since `R - L` is already greater than 1, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001**
