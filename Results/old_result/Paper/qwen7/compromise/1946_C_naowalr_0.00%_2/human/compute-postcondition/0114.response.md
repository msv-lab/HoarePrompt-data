Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` remains `t`, `n` is the total number of unique integers entered (plus one), `k` is an integer, and `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list except for the entries that contain the connections between the nodes as specified by the input.**

Explanation: The line `L = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `L`. This assignment does not affect any other variables or the state of the adjacency list `adj`. The values of `i`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their previous states.
