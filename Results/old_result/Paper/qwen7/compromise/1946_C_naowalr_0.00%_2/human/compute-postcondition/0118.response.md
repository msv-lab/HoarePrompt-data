Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001**

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, which means `x` is the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the calculation results in `x` being 50001. The initial values of `L` and `R` remain unchanged.
