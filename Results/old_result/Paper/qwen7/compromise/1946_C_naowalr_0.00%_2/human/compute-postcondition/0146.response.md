Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values through predefined constraints where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each set of input data, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, for each edge, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n. The function returns information based on these inputs, which could include processing or validating these values according to specific criteria.**
