Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numCuts` is 0, the loop will execute `n-1` times, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` will be `n-1`, `a` will be the integer value of the first input, `b` will be the integer value of the second input, and for every pair `(a, b)` provided as input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, forming an undirected graph where each node is connected to every other node exactly once. `L` is 1, `R` is 100001.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numCuts` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers from inputs, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other, forming an undirected graph, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1). If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then no changes are made. Otherwise, `R` is updated to the integer value of `(L + x) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `numCuts` is 0; if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is equal to `x` and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. Otherwise, `R` is equal to `x` and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `numCuts` is 0, `x` is either `L` or `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `R` is `x` if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
