Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first input, `b` is the integer value of the second input, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[b, a]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[a, b]`, meaning `a` and `b` are already in the list. After executing the code, `a` is appended to `adj[b]`, resulting in `adj[b]` containing `[b, a]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
