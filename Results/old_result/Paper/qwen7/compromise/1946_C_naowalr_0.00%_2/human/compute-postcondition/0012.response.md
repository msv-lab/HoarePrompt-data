Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the condition `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first input.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second input.
   - `adj[b]` now contains the value `[b, a]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 (i.e., `n > 2`).

5. **State the new conditions**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` remains the integer value of the first input.
   - `b` remains the integer value of the second input.
   - `adj[b]` remains `[b, a]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input, `b` is the integer value of the second input, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[b, a]`**.
