Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, `i` is 2, `z` is 9999.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `z` will be set to `t - 1`, which is `9999` since `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. The loop terminates when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `L` and `R` converge to the same value, which is 50001 in this case. The value of `x` will be the final midpoint of the range `[L, R]`, which is also 50001. Since `numCuts` is not incremented within the loop and is initially 0, it remains 0. The value of `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which does not change during the loop iterations. The variable `i` will be the last value it takes in the inner loop, which is `n-1` for the last graph processed, but since the problem does not specify the exact value of `n`, we can only say it is the value of `i` after the last iteration of the outer loop, which is `2` in this context.
