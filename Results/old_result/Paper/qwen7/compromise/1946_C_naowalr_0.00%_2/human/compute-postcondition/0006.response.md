Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b`.**

Explanation: The line `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` is the first integer input and `b` is the second integer input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
