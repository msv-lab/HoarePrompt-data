Output State: **`a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b]`**.

This means that the adjacency list `adj` has been updated such that the list at index `a` (which was initially an empty list) now includes the value `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
