Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[n]`.

However, the value of `a[n]` is not explicitly given. We only know that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2. This means that `l[a[n] - 1]` equals 2. But this does not give us the value of `a[n]` directly.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[n]` from the provided conditions alone. Therefore, the output will be in terms of `a[n]`.

Output: **a[n] a[n]**
