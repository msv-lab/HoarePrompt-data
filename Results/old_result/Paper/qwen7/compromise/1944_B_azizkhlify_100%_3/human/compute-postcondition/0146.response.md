Output State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` by 1. It does not affect the value of `i` directly but updates it to `i + 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 2` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `n`.
