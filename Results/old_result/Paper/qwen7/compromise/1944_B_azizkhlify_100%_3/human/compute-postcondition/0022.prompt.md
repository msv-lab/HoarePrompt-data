Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a list of n integers where each element at index `x-1` (with `x` being an element in `a`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of n zeros, `res` is an empty list, `i` is n.

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has processed all elements in the list `a`. The list `l` will have been updated such that for each element `x` in the list `a`, the element at index `x-1` in `l` will be incremented by 1. All other variables (`re`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains the same, `r[a[i-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
