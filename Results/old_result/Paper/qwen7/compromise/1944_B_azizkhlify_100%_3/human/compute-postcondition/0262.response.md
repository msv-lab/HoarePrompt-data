Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be at least 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are in. This action does not change the values of `i` or `n`. The precondition that `i` is `n + 2` and `n` must be at least 3 remains unchanged.
