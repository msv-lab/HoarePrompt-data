Postcondition: **The loop has executed all its iterations, and `i` will iterate over all elements in `res` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is `4 * k - ul`, and `ul` is `k * 2`. The `res` list contains all elements that meet the condition `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `i` starts from `n-1` as specified in the initial state. The current value of `ul` is not equal to `ur`.**
