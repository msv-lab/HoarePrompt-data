Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will iterate over all elements in `res` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, starting from `2 * n - 1` down to `n`. For each `i`, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it will be printed twice and then set to 0, increasing `ur` by 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop will break.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will start from `2 * n - 1` and decrement until it reaches `n`. During each iteration, if the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` is met, the corresponding element `a[i]` will be printed twice, and `r[a[i] - 1]` will be set to 0, incrementing `ur` by 2. If at any point `ul` equals `ur`, the loop will exit prematurely.
