Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
