Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is the next element in `res`.
   - `res` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `k` is calculated as `4 * k - ul`.
   - `ul` is calculated as `k * 2`.

2. **Simplifying the Calculation of `k` and `ul`:**
   - From the formula `k = 4 * k - ul` and `ul = k * 2`, we can substitute `ul` into the equation for `k`:
     \[
     k = 4 * k - (k * 2)
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     k = 4k - 2k \implies k = 2k \implies k = 0
     \]
     Therefore, `k = 0` and `ul = k * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0`.

3. **Determining the Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is the next element in `res`, and `res` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, we need to know the structure of `res` and `a` to determine `i`. However, without the explicit values of `res` and `a`, we can only say that `i` is an index in `res` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

4. **Printing Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(i, end=' ')`. This will print the value of `i` followed by a space.

Given the above analysis, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **i (where i is the next index in res such that l[a[i] - 1] is 1)**
