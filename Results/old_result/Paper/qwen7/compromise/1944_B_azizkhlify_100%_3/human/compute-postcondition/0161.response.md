Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Since `i` was previously set to `2 * n` and `a[i] - 1` was equal to 2 before the assignment, after executing the line `l[a[i] - 1] = 0`, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
