Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `l` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, while `n`, `k`, and `a` retain their original values.
