Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` is less than or equal to 3.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - Since `i` is 4 and `n` is less than or equal to 3, `2 * n` would be less than or equal to 6.
   - Therefore, `i` (which is 4) is not less than `2 * n` because `2 * n` is at most 6, and `i` is 4.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the current values, the loop condition `i < 2 * n` is not satisfied. Hence, the loop will not execute again.

Since the loop will not execute again based on the given conditions, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time. However, we should still state the current conditions clearly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is less than or equal to 3**
