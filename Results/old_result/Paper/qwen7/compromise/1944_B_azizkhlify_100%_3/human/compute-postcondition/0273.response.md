Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input split, `a[1]` will be printed, `a[2]` will be printed, `a[3]` will be printed, followed by a space, `i` is now set to `a[3]`, `res` is an empty list, `re` is still 2, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `r` with `n` zeros using the expression `[0] * n`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `i`, `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `l` remain unchanged. The only new variable `r` is initialized with `n` zeros.
