Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was previously equal to 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the loop or conditional block it is inside to terminate. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and the condition for `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged, and we simply break out of the loop or conditional block.
