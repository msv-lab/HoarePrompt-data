Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive)
   - `re` is 1
   - `res` is a list containing `a[1]`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `re` and `res` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `re` is 1, and `res` is a list containing `a[1]`**
