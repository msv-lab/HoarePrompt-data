Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 3.
2. `n` must be less than or equal to 3, but this does not affect the print statement directly.
3. `a[3]` exists, and its value is used to index `r`. This means that `r` is accessed using the value at index 3 of `a`.
4. It is also stated that the element at that index in `r` is 2. Therefore, `r[a[3]]` is 2.

Given these points, let's analyze the print statement:

- `a[i]` where `i` is 3, so `a[3]` is accessed.
- Since `a[3]` is used to index `r` and the element at that index in `r` is 2, `a[3]` must be the index that gives us the value 2 in `r`.

Therefore, both instances of `a[i]` will print the same value, which is the value at index 3 of `a`, and this value is used to access `r` where it results in 2.

Output: **2 2**
