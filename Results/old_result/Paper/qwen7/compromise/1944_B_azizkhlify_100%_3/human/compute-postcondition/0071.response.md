Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `re` is 1**

The code `re += 1` increments the value of `re` by 1. Given that `re` was initially not defined in the provided context, it is assumed to be initialized to 0 before this line of code. After executing `re += 1`, `re` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
