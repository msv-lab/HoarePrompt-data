Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be at least 3.
   - The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- Since `n` must be at least 3, `i` must also be at least 3.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, but this information is not directly needed to determine what `a[i]` is.

Given that `i` is `n` and `n` is at least 3, let's assume `a[i]` is some value in the list `a`. The specific value of `a[i]` is not provided, but we need to print `a[i]` twice.

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of `a[i]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a[i] a[i]**
