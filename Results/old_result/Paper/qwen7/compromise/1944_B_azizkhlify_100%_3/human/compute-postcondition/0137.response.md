Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer; `a` is a list of integers input from the user split by space and converted to integers; `l` is a list of `n` zeros, where `n` is the value of `k`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `l` with `n` elements, each set to 0. Here, `n` is the value of `k`, which is an integer input from the user. The list `a` and the variable `k` retain their initial states as per the initial conditions.
