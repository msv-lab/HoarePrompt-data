Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Head Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
2. **Increment of `i`**: In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Termination Condition**: The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `2 * n`.

### Current State
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.

### Next Iteration
- Since `i` is currently `n`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
- Therefore, the loop will continue if `n + 1` is still within the range `[n, 2 * n)`.

### Adjusting the State
- `i` will be incremented to `n + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The state of `r[a[i] - 1]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

### Updated State
- `i` will be `n + 1`.
- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1, where `i` is now `n + 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
