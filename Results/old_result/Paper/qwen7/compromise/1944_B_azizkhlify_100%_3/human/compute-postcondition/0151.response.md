Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is the original value of `k`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the original value of `k` as it does not change within the loop.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i` but will be incremented again if `i` falls within the range specified by the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is the original value of `k`.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented again in the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the original value of `k`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**.
