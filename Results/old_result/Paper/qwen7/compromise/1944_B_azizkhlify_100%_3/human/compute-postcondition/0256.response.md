Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be at least 3.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is incremented by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 2 * n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be within the range `[n, 2 * n)`. Given that `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.

4. **Conditions to Adjust**:
   - `i` should be updated to `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The condition `n` must be at least 3 remains unchanged.
   - The postconditions related to `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` will be checked when `i` reaches `n + 2`.

5. **Final State**: The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged conditions for `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be at least 3**.
