Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will iterate over all elements in `res` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, starting from `2 * n - 1` down to `n`. For each `i`, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it will be printed twice and then set to 0, increasing `ur` by 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop will break. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the process continues as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop completes all its iterations, the output will be the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` printed in that order, followed by a space. The variable `i` will be set to `a[3]`, `res` will be an empty list, `re` will still be 2, and the upper limit `ul` is not equal to the lower limit `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output consists of the elements printed during each iteration, which are `a[3] a[3]` and `a[4] a[4]`, separated by spaces. The variable `i` is set to `5`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The value of `n` remains less than or equal to 3, and the array `r` has been updated such that the elements indexed by `a[3] - 1` and `a[4] - 1` are set to 0. The variable `ur` is incremented by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, resulting in `ur` being 4. The variable `ul` remains unchanged unless it equals `ur`, in which case the loop would break, but since the condition `ul != ur` is true, the loop completes all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
