Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000
- `a` is a list of integers
- The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the information given:
- `i` is `n-1`, so `a[i]` refers to the last element of the list `a`.
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, but this does not directly affect the value of `a[i]` being printed.

Therefore, `a[i]` is the last element of the list `a`. Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we can only describe it as the last element of the list `a`.

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]] (where [a[i]] is the last element of the list `a`)**
