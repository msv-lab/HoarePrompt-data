Output State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` by 1. It also updates `i` to `i + 1`. The initial state indicates that `l[a[i] - 1]` is already incremented by 1 and `i` is set to `i + 1`. Since the code only performs these actions, the output state remains the same as the initial state, justifying the given output state.
