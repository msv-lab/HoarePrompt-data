Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in res:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `res`**:
   - The initial state of `k` is given as `4 * k - ul`.
   - The initial state of `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - The initial state of `ul` is `k * 2`.
   - The initial state of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in the range from `n` to `2*n-1`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - After the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-1`.
   - `re` will be equal to the number of elements added to `res` based on the condition that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
   - `res` will be a list containing those elements.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `res`, the variable `i` will take each value from `res` one by one.
   - Therefore, `i` should be able to take each element from `res` during the loop execution.
   - `res` should contain the elements that satisfy the condition `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that `res` contains the correct elements and `i` iterates over these elements.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` will iterate over elements in `res`, `res` contains elements such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is `4 * k - ul`, `ul` is `k * 2`**.
