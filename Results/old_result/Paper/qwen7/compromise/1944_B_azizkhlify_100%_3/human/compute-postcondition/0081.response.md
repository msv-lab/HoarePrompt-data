Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `re` is 2, and `res` is a list containing `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`. The other variables (`n`, `re`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `res` now containing `a[2]` in addition to its previous content.
