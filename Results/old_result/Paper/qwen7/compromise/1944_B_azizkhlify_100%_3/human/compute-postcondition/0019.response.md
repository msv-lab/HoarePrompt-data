Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Since `i` is initially `n + 1`, the index `a[i] - 1` is effectively `a[n] - 1`. However, without knowing the specific value of `a[n]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]`. Therefore, the only change is that `r[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
