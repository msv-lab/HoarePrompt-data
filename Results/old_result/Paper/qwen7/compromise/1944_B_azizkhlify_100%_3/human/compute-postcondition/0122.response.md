To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state:

Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Initial State:
- There is no explicit information about the values of `a` or `i`.

Since there is no explicit information about the values of `a` or `i`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables involved.

Output: **a[i] a[i]** (where `a[i]` is the value at index `i` of the list `a`)
