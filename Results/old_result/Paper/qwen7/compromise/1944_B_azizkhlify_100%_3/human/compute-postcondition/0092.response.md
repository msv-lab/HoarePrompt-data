Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Understanding `res`**: 
   - The elements in `res` are such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
   - This means that for each index `i` in `res`, the element `a[i] - 1` must be an index in `l` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1.

2. **Understanding `i`**:
   - `i` will iterate over the elements in `res`.

3. **Understanding `k` and `ul`**:
   - `k` is defined as `4 * k - ul`.
   - `ul` is defined as `k * 2`.
   - Substituting `ul` in the equation for `k`, we get `k = 4 * k - 2 * k`, which simplifies to `k = 2 * k`.
   - This implies that `k` must be 0 because the only way this equation holds true is if `k` is 0.

4. **Understanding `n`**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, but it does not affect the printing of `i`.

Given these points, let's analyze the `print(i, end=' ')` statement:

- Since `i` iterates over the elements in `res`, and each element in `res` satisfies the condition that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the value of `i` will be the index of those elements in `res`.
- However, without knowing the specific values of `res` and `l`, we cannot determine the exact values of `i`.

Since the exact values of `i` depend on the contents of `res` and `l`, we can only describe the general form of the output:

Output: **i (where i iterates over the indices in res such that l[a[i] - 1] is 1)**
