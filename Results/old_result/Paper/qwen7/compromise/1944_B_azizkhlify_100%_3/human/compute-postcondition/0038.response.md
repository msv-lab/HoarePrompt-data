Output State: **`i` is current_i + 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is current_ul + 4, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0**.

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. Since `ul` was initially `current_ul + 2`, after executing the code, `ul` becomes `current_ul + 4`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
