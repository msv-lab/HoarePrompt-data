Postcondition: **`k` is now `4 * k - ul`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is `k * 2`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in the range from `n` to `2*n-1`. After the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `re` will be equal to the number of elements added to `res` based on the condition that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `res` will be a list containing those elements.**
