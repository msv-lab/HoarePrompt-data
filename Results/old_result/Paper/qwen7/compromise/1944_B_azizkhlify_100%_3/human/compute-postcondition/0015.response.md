Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - Initially, `i` is set to `n`.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n`, `i` should be set to `n`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `2 * n` for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to `n` and that `i` is less than `2 * n` for the loop to execute.

**State:**
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000

So, the final state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000**
