Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` and now also contains `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Initially, `nums` contained integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) and an additional element `k - nums[idx]`. After appending `k + 1`, `nums` now includes this new element. All other variables remain unchanged.
