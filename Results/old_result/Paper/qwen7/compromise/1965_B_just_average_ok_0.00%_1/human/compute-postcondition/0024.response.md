Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.

2. **Understand the loop head variables**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `k` and `idx`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is `current_iterations + 1`.
   - `k` must be at least 16777216.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`.

4. **Evaluate the loop condition with current state**:
   - Given `idx = 0`, the condition becomes `k >= 1 << 0`, which simplifies to `k >= 1`.

5. **Check the constraints**:
   - Since `k` must be at least 16777216, it already satisfies the condition `k >= 1`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be considered is `idx`. For the loop to execute the first time, `idx` should be 0, which is already the case.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the given state to make the loop execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`.**
