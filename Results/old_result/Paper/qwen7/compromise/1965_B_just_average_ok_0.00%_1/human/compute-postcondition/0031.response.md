Output State: `idx` is 25, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Given that `idx` increases by 1 each iteration and the loop executed 3 times up to `idx` being 4, we can deduce that the loop will continue until `1 << idx` exceeds `k`. Since `k` is at least 16777216 and the list `nums` contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), the loop will continue until `idx` reaches 25 because \(1 << 25 = 33554432\), which is the next power of two greater than 16777216. At this point, `k` will no longer satisfy the condition `k >= 1 << idx`, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, `idx` will be 25 after all iterations.
