Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and `nums` now contains an additional element which is `k + 1`, and `nums` is updated to exclude `1 << idx` (which is \(2^{23}\)).**

Explanation: The code removes the element \(2^{23}\) from the list `nums`. Since `idx` is 23, \(1 << idx\) equals \(2^{23}\). The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
