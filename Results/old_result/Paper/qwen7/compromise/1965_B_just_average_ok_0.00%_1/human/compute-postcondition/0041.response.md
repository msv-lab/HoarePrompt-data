Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)**.

Explanation: The code snippet replaces the existing `nums` list with a new list generated using a list comprehension. The new list `nums` contains the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). The other variables (`idx`, `t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
