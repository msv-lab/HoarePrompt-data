Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `idx` is 24.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The value of `t` does not affect the length of `nums`, so it is irrelevant for this specific calculation.
   - `n` is `current_iterations + 1`. Since `current_iterations` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but it does not affect the length of `nums` either.
   - `k` must be at least 16777216. This value is used to determine additional elements added to `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{24}\). This means `nums` initially contains the integers from 1 to 8388607 (since \(2^{24} = 16777216\)).

2. **Additional Elements Added to `nums`:**
   - `nums` now also contains `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
     - `nums[idx]` is the element at index 24, which is \(2^{24-1} = 2^{23} = 8388608\).
     - Therefore, `k - nums[idx]` is \(16777216 - 8388608 = 8388608\).
     - And `k + nums[idx] + 1` is \(16777216 + 8388608 + 1 = 25165825\).

3. **Final List `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` contains integers from 1 to 8388607.
   - After adding `8388608` and `25165825`, the list `nums` will have these additional elements.
   - Thus, `nums` will contain 8388609 elements (from 1 to 8388607 plus the two new elements).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(len(nums))`, which will print the length of the list `nums`.

Given the above steps, the length of `nums` after adding the specified elements is 8388609.

Output: **8388609**
