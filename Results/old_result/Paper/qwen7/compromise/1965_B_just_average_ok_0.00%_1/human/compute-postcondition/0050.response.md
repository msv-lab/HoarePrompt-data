Output State: `idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Given that `idx` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after 24 iterations, `idx` will be 24. At this point, \(1 << 24 = 16777216\), so `k` must be at least 16777216 for the loop to continue. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `nums`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop's condition or body.
