Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)**.

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
