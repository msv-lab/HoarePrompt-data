Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)**.

The code sets `idx` to 0, which changes its value from 24 to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
