Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `nums[23]` is `k - 2^{23}`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 23, `nums[idx]` is `2^{23}`, so `nums` now contains the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{22}\) and \(2^{23} - k\). All other variables remain unchanged.
