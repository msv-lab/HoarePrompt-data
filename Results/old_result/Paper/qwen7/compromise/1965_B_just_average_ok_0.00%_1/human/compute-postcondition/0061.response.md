Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three values: the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it calculates and prints the length of a list `nums` which contains the first 24 powers of 2 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)) and additional elements based on the value of \(k\). Specifically, it removes one element from this list and appends three new elements. The printed output includes the length of `nums` followed by the elements in `nums`. The final state of `nums` varies for each test case based on the value of \(k\), but it always includes the first 24 powers of 2 and some additional elements.**
