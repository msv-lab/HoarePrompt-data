Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables in the loop head are:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range. It does not hold any specific value but is used to control the loop.
   - `int(input())`: This is the number of iterations the loop will run.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since the loop head only involves the input from `int(input())`, the state of the variables `_` and `int(input())` will change with each iteration. However, since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't affect the state directly. The key variable here is the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `idx` is 24.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is `current_iterations + 1`.
   - `k` must be at least 16777216.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{24}\) and now also contains `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations must increase by 1. Therefore, the new value of `n` will be `current_iterations + 2`.

5. **Final State**: After the loop runs one more time, the state will be:
   - `idx` remains 24 (since it is not affected by the loop).
   - `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) (since it is not affected by the loop).
   - `n` becomes `current_iterations + 2`.
   - `k` remains at least 16777216 (since it is not affected by the loop).
   - `nums` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 2`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{24}\) and now also contains `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`**.
