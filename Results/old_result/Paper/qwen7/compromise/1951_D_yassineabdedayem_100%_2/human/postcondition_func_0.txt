The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It checks specific conditions involving these integers and prints 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional details if applicable. Specifically, it prints 'YES' when \( n \geq k \) or when \( n + 2 > 2k \), and prints 'NO' otherwise. For each 'YES' case, it also outputs two more integers. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the corresponding results.
