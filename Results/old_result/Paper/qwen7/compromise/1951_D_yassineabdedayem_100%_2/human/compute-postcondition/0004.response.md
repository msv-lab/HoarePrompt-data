Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers: t, n, and k, where t is an integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. The function returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function indirectly takes three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, with specific constraints on their values, and returns a result based on these inputs.
