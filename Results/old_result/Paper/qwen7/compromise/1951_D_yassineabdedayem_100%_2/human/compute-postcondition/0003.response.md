Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input pair (n, k), the program checks conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO'. If 'YES', it also prints additional details. Since the input values are not specified, the exact output cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs. However, the output will consist of lines printed during each iteration, with each line either stating 'YES' followed by integers, or 'NO'.
