Output State: **`cnt` is [0, 0], `zeroes` is the number of occurrences of 0 in `s`, `ans` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code initializes the list `cnt` to `[0, 0]`. This changes the value of `cnt`, but does not affect the values of `zeroes`, `ans`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
