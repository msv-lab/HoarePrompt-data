Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5. For each test case, the function returns either a specific value or an error message if `t` is out of the specified range.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It checks if `t` is within the range of 1 to 10^4. If `t` is valid, it processes the binary string `s`. If `t` is invalid, it returns an error message indicating that `t` is out of the allowed range.
