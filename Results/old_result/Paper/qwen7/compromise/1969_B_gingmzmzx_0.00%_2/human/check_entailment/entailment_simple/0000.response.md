Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. However, the current implementation calculates something different.
2. The function `func_1()`:
   - Converts the input string `s` into a list of integers.
   - Counts the number of zeros in the string.
   - Uses two counters `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s.
   - Iterates through the string and updates `ans` based on conditions that do not align with the problem's requirements.
3. Specifically, the logic inside the loop:
   - Adds 1 to `ans` if a zero is encountered and there has been at least one one encountered so far.
   - Adds the difference between the initial number of zeros and the count of zeros seen so far to `ans` if a one is encountered.
4. This approach does not account for the minimum cost of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string. It instead seems to be calculating a different metric related to the counts of zeros and ones in the string.

Given these observations, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
