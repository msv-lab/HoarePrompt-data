### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations, where the cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the shifted substring.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads an integer `n` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It initializes two counters `cnt` for zeros and ones and a variable `ans` to store the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the counters and the cost.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The code reads the binary string as a list of integers, but it should be read as a string to correctly handle the cyclic shifts.
   - The logic to calculate the cost is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts and their costs.
   - The approach to finding the minimum cost is not accurate. The given code does not implement the correct algorithm to find the minimum cost.

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code suggests that the function aims to compute a value `ans` based on the counts of zeros and ones in the string `s`. However, this does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The annotated code states that `ans` is calculated as the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1. This is not a correct approach to solving the problem.
   - The annotated code also mentions that `cnt` will hold the total counts of each integer in `s`, but this does not help in calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify the positions where we need to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - We can use a more complex algorithm that identifies the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed and calculates their costs.
   - A correct approach would involve identifying the longest prefix of zeros and then performing cyclic shifts to move the remaining ones to their correct positions.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly solve the problem. The annotated code also does not accurately reflect the intended solution.
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the code does not implement the correct algorithm to find the minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct algorithm to find the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the binary string.
