You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        for i in range(cur):
            if M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then sorts the list and iterates through it to find the maximum value \( cur \) that meets specific conditions. If no such value exists, it sets \( cur \) to the second-highest number plus one. Finally, it prints the value of \( cur \) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and computes the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This step is unnecessary for the correct implementation of the game logic since the order of elements does not affect the MEX calculation directly.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`, which will be used to track the current maximum value that can be excluded.
   - `M` is a dictionary to keep track of the count of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments its count in the dictionary `M`.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - It checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals the size of the array `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from `0` to `cur` to find the smallest index `i` such that the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. This index `i` is the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Game Logic:**
   - Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`, while Bob picks an element and removes it from `a`.
   - The goal is to maximize the MEX for Alice and minimize it for Bob.
   - The program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob; instead, it tries to predict the optimal outcome based on the counts of numbers.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to find the smallest number that is missing from the counts stored in `M`.
   - However, the logic for finding the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the turns of Alice and Bob and their strategic choices.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's consider the example test case provided:

```
3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1
```

#### Case 1: `0 0 1 1`
- Sorted array: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
- `M` after processing: `{0: 2, 1: 2}`
- Sum of counts: `2 + 2 = 4`, which is equal to `S`.
- Increment `cur` by 1: `cur = 1`
- Check for MEX: `0` is present, `1` is present, so the MEX is `2`.

#### Case 2: `0 1 2 3`
- Sorted array: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `M` after processing: `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
- Sum of counts: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`, which is equal to `S`.
- Increment `cur` by 1: `cur = 1`
- Check for MEX: `0` is present, `1` is present, so the MEX is `2`.

#### Case 3: `1 1`
- Sorted array: `[1, 1]`
- `M` after processing: `{1: 2}`
- Sum of counts: `2`, which is equal to `S`.
- Increment `cur` by 1: `cur = 1`
- Check for MEX: `0` is not present, so the MEX is `0`.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the game logic and the MEX calculation. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
