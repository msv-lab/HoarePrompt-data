Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and computes the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This step is unnecessary for the correct implementation of the game logic since the order of elements does not affect the MEX calculation directly.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`, which will be used to track the current maximum value that can be excluded.
   - `M` is a dictionary to keep track of the count of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments its count in the dictionary `M`.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - It checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals the size of the array `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from `0` to `cur` to find the smallest index `i` such that the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. This index `i` is the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Game Logic:**
   - Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`, while Bob picks an element and removes it from `a`.
   - The goal is to maximize the MEX for Alice and minimize it for Bob.
   - The program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob; instead, it tries to predict the optimal outcome based on the counts of numbers.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to find the smallest number that is missing from the counts stored in `M`.
   - However, the logic for finding the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the turns of Alice and Bob and their strategic choices.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's consider the example test case provided:

```
3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1
```

#### Case 1: `0 0 1 1`
- Sorted array: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
- `M` after processing: `{0: 2, 1: 2}`
- Sum of counts: `2 + 2 = 4`, which is equal to `S`.
- Increment `cur` by 1: `cur = 1`
- Check for MEX: `0` is present, `1` is present, so the MEX is `2`.

#### Case 2: `0 1 2 3`
- Sorted array: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `M` after processing: `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
- Sum of counts: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`, which is equal to `S`.
- Increment `cur` by 1: `cur = 1`
- Check for MEX: `0` is present, `1` is present, so the MEX is `2`.

#### Case 3: `1 1`
- Sorted array: `[1, 1]`
- `M` after processing: `{1: 2}`
- Sum of counts: `2`, which is equal to `S`.
- Increment `cur` by 1: `cur = 1`
- Check for MEX: `0` is not present, so the MEX is `0`.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the game logic and the MEX calculation. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
