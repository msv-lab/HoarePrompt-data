Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Game Mechanics Not Properly Implemented**: The game involves two different rules for Alice and Bob. Alice can pick any element and append it to her array `c`, whereas Bob can only pick an element and delete it from `a`. The current implementation does not simulate these rules properly.

2. **MEX Calculation Logic**: The logic to calculate the MEX is flawed. The current implementation tries to build a dictionary `M` where keys are elements from the sorted array `N`, and values are counts of those elements. However, it doesn't correctly simulate the game turns and doesn't account for the fact that Alice and Bob are picking elements from the same array `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The solution does not consider the optimal strategies for both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current implementation does not reflect these strategic considerations.

### Correct Solution Outline:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game turns and ensure that Alice and Bob play optimally. Here’s a high-level approach:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array `a` to facilitate picking the smallest available elements.
2. **Simulate Turns**: Simulate the turns where Alice and Bob pick elements according to their rules.
3. **Track Picked Elements**: Use a set or similar data structure to track which elements have been picked by Alice and Bob.
4. **Calculate MEX**: After all turns, calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here’s a more detailed outline of the correct approach:

```python
def mex(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    i = 0
    while i in seen:
        i += 1
    return i

def optimal_game_score():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice picks first, then Bob
        alice_picks = []
        bob_picks = []
        
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < n or j < n:
            if i < n:
                alice_picks.append(a[i])
                i += 1
            if j < n:
                bob_picks.append(a[j])
                j += 1
        
        # Combine picks into one list
        c = alice_picks + bob_picks
        
        # Calculate MEX
        print(mex(c))

optimal_game_score()
```

This approach ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally according to the rules and calculates the MEX correctly.
