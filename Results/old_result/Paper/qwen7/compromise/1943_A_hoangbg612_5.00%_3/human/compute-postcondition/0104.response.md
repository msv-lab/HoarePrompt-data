Output State: **After executing `cur += 1`, `cur` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value. `M[cur]` will be 1, and all other entries in `M` will remain 0. The variable `i` will retain its last incremented value, which is `len(N) - 1`, and `S` will remain unchanged as it was not involved in the loop operations. The sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`.**

This means that `cur` has been incremented by 1, while `M[cur]` is set to 1 and all other entries in `M` remain 0. The variable `i` retains its value from the end of the loop, which is `len(N) - 1`, and `S` remains unchanged.
