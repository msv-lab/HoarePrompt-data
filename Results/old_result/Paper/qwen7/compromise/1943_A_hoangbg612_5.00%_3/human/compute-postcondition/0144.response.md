Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary. If `num` (the last element of `N`) is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M` is updated to have `cur` as the key with value 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1, and `M` has `-1` as the key with value 1.
