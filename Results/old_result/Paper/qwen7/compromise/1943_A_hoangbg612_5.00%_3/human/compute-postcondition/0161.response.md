Output State: **`cur` is now `num`, `i` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces (now including its last element), `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value 1, and `num` is the last element of `N`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Since `cur` is currently equal to `num`, the dictionary `M` now has a key `-1` with the value `1` and a new key `num` with the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
