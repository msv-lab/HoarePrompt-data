Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `N`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is `-1`
   - `i` is `0`
   - `S` is an input integer (not directly relevant to the loop)
   - `T` is `1`
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces
   - `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`
   - `num` is the last element of `N`

4. **Determine the Next Element in `N`**:
   - Since `num` is the last element of `N` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in the loop would be the second-to-last element of `N`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `num` will now be the second-to-last element of `N`.
   - `N` will be the list without its last element.

Given these points, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cur` is `-1`, `i` is `0`, `S` is an input integer, `T` is `1`, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces without its last element, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, and `num` is the second-to-last element of `N`.**
