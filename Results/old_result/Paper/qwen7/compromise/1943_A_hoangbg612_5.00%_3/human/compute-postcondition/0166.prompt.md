Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is -1, `i` is `len(N) - 1`, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur` is `-1`, `i` is `0`, `S` is an input integer, `T` is `1`, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, and `num` is the last element of `N`. This is because either `num` is not greater than `cur + 1` (which is `-1 + 1 = 0`), and no change is made to `cur` and `i`, or `num` is less than or equal to `-1`, leading to `cur` being set to `-1` and `i` remaining `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is either the second-to-last element of `N` or -1, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces without its last element, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the second-to-last element of `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is either the last element of `N` if `num > cur`, otherwise `cur` is the second-to-last element of `N` plus 1. `i` is 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `i` is 0. `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the last element of `N`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
