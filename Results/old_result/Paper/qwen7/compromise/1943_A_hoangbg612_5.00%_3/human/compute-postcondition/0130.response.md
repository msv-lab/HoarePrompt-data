Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num` and the list `N`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.

3. **Check the initial state of `num` and `N`**:
   - Initially, `i` is set to `len(N) - 1`, meaning `i` points to the last element of the list `N`.
   - The loop will start with `num` being the last element of `N` because the first iteration sets `num` to `N[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `num` being the last element of `N`, we need to ensure that `num` is correctly initialized to the last element of `N`.
   - The list `N` should be correctly defined as a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `num` should be the last element of `N`.
- `N` should be a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the last element of `N`**.
