Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `N`. The initial conditions for `T` and `S` remain unchanged.
