Postcondition: `cur` is either the last element of `N` if `num > cur`, otherwise `cur` is the second-to-last element of `N` plus 1. `i` is 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `i` is 0. `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the last element of `N`.
