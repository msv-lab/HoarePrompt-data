Postcondition: **After executing the if statement, `cur` will hold the highest number found in `N`, `M[cur]` will be 1, and all other entries in `M` will be 0. The variable `i` will retain its last incremented value, which is `len(N) - 1`, and `S` will remain unchanged as it was not involved in the loop operations. The sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`.**
