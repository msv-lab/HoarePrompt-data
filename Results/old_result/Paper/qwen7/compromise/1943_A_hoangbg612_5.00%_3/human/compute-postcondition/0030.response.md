Output State: **`N` must have at least one element (one less than before), `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1, and `M[cur]` is updated according to the condition involving `num` and `cur`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables (`N`, `num`, and `M`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `N` must have at least one element (one less than before) and the condition for updating `M[cur]` based on whether `num > cur` still holds.
