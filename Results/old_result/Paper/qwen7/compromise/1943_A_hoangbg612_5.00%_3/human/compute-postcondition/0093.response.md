Output State: **`cur` is the next element in `N` which is `cur + 1`, `N` must contain at least one element, and `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional structure without changing the values of `cur`, `N`, or `M[cur]`. The conditions and values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
