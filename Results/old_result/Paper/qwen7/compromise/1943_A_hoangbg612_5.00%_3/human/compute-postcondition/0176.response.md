Let's analyze the given state and the loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cur` is at least 1.
- `i` is within the range `[0, cur)`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(cur):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < cur`.
2. **Variables Involved**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `i` and `cur`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within the range `[0, cur)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within this range.
- Since `i` increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `cur`.

### Updated State:
- `cur` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop head.
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

### Final Answer:
State: **`cur` is at least 1, `i` is within the range `[0, cur - 1)`**.

This means `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`, and for the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be within the range `[0, cur)`.
