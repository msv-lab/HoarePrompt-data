Postcondition: `N` must contain at least one element. The current value of `num` is greater than the current value of `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + 1` and `num` is greater than the updated value of `cur + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, no changes are made to `cur` and `num`.
