Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `N` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `M[cur]` is now equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The other variables (`cur`, `N`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
