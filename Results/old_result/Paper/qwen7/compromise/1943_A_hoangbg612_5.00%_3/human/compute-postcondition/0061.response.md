Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `cur` is greater than or equal to the length of `N`.
2. `i` is defined as `cur - 1`.

Given this information, let's determine what will be printed:

- Since `cur` is greater than or equal to the length of `N`, it means `cur` is at least as large as the number of elements in `N`.
- When we subtract 1 from `cur`, we get `i`. 

However, the print statement only outputs `cur` itself, not `i`.

Therefore, the value printed will be `cur`.

Output: **cur**
