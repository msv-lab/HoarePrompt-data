Output State: **All entries in `M` are either 0 or 1, with exactly `len(N)` ones in total, `cur` is equal to `len(N)`, `i` is equal to `len(N) - 1`, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The other variables (`M`, `cur`, `i`, `S`, `T`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about `N` being sorted.
