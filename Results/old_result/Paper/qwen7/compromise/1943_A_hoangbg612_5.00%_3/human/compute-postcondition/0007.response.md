Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in N:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num` and `N`**:
   - `num` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `N`.
   - Since `N` is a list, the loop will continue until `N` is empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the list `N` is not empty for the loop to execute. If `N` is empty, the loop will not run even once.
   - The variable `num` will take on the values from `N` one by one, starting from the first element.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `N` is not empty. The other variables (`cur`, `T`, `S`, `M`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`N` must have at least one element**.
