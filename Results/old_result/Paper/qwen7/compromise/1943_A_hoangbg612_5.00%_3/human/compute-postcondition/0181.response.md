Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `cur`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range `[0, cur)`. This means `i` must be less than `cur`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is at least 1.
   - `i` is within the range `[0, cur - 1)`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop runs as long as `i < cur`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the maximum value it could have been, which is `cur - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `cur`.
   - However, since the loop condition is `i < cur`, `i` cannot be `cur` because it would then be equal to `cur` and the loop would stop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to `cur` to prepare for the next iteration where it will be incremented to `cur + 1`.
   - `cur` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cur` is at least 1, `i` is `cur`**
