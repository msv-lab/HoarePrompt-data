Output State: **`N` must have at least one element (one less than before), `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was modifying `cur` and updating `M[cur]` based on `num`. The values of `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain as they were just before the `break` statement was executed.
