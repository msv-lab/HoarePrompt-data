Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It returns information based on the given constraints and relationships.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. The function does not take any parameters directly but processes these inputs according to the specified constraints and relationships, and returns output based on the given data.
