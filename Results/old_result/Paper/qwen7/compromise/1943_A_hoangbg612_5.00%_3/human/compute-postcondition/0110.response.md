Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is less than `cur`, `cur` remains the highest number found in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, and the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the loop or if statement being executed has been broken out of, but the values of `i`, `cur`, `cur` (as the highest number found in `N`), `S`, and `M[i]` remain unchanged from their previous states.
