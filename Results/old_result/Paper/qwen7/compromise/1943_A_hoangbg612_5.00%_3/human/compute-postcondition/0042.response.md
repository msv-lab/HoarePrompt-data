Output State: **`cur` is the maximum value in the original list `N` plus 1, and the dictionary `M` contains counts for how many times each number in `N` appeared relative to the new value of `cur`. The sum of all values in `M` is still equal to `S`. The list `N` is empty as each element has been processed exactly once.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the dictionary `M` and the list `N` remain unchanged in terms of their conditions. The sum `S` of the values in `M` stays the same because no elements have been added or removed from `N`.
