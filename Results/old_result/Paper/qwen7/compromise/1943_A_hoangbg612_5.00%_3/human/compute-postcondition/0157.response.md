Output State: **`cur` is either the last element of `N` or -1, `i` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces (now including its last element), `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the last element of `N`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states.
