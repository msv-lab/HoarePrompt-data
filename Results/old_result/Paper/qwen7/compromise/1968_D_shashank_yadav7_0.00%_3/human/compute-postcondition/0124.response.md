Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n - 2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given `i = n - 2`, this means `(n - 2) < n` which is always true for any positive integer `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n - 2`, the loop will definitely execute at least once.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a valid input integer (greater than or equal to 2 because `i` is `n - 2`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be a valid input integer (greater than or equal to 2)**
