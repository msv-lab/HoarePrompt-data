Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by values of \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), \( b \), \( s \), a permutation \( p \), and an array \( a \). For each test case, it calculates two cumulative maximum values, \( bm \) and \( sm \), based on the values in \( a \) and the indices \( b \) and \( s \) modified by the permutation \( p \) and the count \( k \). Finally, it prints 'Bodya' if \( bm \) is greater than \( sm \), 'Sasha' if \( sm \) is greater than \( bm \), and 'Draw' if they are equal.**
