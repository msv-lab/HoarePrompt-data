Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The only variable directly modified by the loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: From the given information, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(t)`. Since `i` starts at `n - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `n - 2` (assuming `t` is greater than or equal to `n`).

4. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be `n - 2` for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n - 2`**
