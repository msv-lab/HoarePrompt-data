Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `bp + a[p[b] - 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
