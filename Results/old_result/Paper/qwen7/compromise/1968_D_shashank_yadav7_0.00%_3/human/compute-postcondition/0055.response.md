Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is `-n+1`
- `b` is `p[p[...]] - n+1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`)
- `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`)
- `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations
- `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `for i in range(t)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
At the start of the next iteration, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. **Variable `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, `i` will become `n + 1`.
2. **Variables `bm` and `sm`**: These values depend on the loop body, but since no specific operations are given, we assume they remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.
3. **Variables `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, and `bp`**: These variables are not directly affected by the loop increment and remain the same unless modified within the loop body.

Given the loop condition and the fact that `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration, the only variable that changes is `i`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `k` is `-n+1`
- `b` is `p[p[...]] - n+1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`)
- `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`)
- `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations
- `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `k` is `-n+1`, `b` is `p[p[...]] - n+1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`), `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`), `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations**
