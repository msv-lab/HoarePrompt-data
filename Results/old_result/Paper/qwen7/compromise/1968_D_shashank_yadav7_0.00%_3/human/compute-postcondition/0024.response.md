Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The other variables (`i`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged with their respective expressions.
