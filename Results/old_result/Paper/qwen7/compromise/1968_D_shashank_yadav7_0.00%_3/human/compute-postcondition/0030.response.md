Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1` - 1, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to itself. Since `k` is -1 and `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, the term `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to `-a[s] + sp`. Therefore, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, -a[s] + sp)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
