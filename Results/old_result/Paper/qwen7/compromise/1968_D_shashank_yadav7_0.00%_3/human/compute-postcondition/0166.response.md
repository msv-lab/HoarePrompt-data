To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step.

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `bm`: Defined as `3 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. This means `bm` is three times the maximum of itself and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`.
   - `b`: Defined as `p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1`. This is a complex nested expression involving the `p` list.
   - `i`: Defined as `-1`.
   - `k`: Defined as `-n`. Since `n` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know `k` is negative.
   - `s`: Defined as `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`. Another complex nested expression involving the `p` list.
   - `sm`: Defined as `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`. This means `sm` is updated by adding the maximum of `sm` and the expression `a[s] * k + sp` plus `a[s]`.
   - `sp`: Defined as `a[s] + sp + a[s] + a[s]`. This means `sp` is updated by adding `a[s]` three more times.
   - `bp`: Defined as `bp + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`. This means `bp` is updated by adding `a[b]` three more times.
   - The condition `bm >= sm` holds true.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Draw')`.

Given the print statement and the initial conditions, the only thing being printed is the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
