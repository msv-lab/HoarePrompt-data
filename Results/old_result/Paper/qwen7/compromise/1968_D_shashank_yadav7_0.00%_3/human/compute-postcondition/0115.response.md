Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code splits the input into four integers and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still `n - 2`.
