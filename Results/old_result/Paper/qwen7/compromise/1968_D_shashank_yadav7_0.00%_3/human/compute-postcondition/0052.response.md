Based on the initial state provided, we need to determine the values of the variables involved in the print statement. Let's break down the variables step-by-step:

1. **Variables `i` and `k`:**
   - `i` is explicitly stated to be `n`.
   - `k` is explicitly stated to be `-n + 1`.

2. **Variables `b` and `s`:**
   - `b` is defined as `p[p[...]] - n + 1` where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`.
   - `s` is defined as `p[p[...]] - (n-1)` where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`.
   
   Since the exact nature of `p` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `b` and `s`. However, we know that both `b` and `s` are derived from applying the function `p` multiple times starting from some initial value.

3. **Variables `bm` and `sm`:**
   - `bm` is the sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` added `n-1` times.
   - `sm` is the sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` added `n-1` times.
   
   Here, `a` is an array, and `bp` and `sp` are sums of repeated elements of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, with `bp` and `sp` being the sum of `a[b]` and `a[s]` repeated `n` times.

4. **Condition `(bm >= sm)` holds true:**
   - This means that after the summation process, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

Given the above, the print statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`. Since no other values are to be printed, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Draw**
