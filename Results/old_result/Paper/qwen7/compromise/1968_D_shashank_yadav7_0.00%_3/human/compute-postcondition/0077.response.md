Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is equal to 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
