State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `t-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` is 0, but since the loop starts with `i=0`, the first iteration will occur when `i` becomes 1.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be adjusted to start from 1.
