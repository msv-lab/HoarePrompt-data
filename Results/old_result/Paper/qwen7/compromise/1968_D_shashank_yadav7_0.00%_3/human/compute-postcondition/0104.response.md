Based on the initial state provided, the variables and their values are as follows:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is `0`
- `b` and `s` have been updated according to the loop's logic, but their exact values are not specified.
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` from the last two iterations.
- `bm` is the highest value of `a[b] * k + bp` calculated in the last two iterations.
- `sm` is the highest value of `a[s] * k + sp` calculated in the last two iterations.
- The condition `(bm > sm)` is true.

The print statement is:

```python
print('Bodya')
```

This statement will print the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **'Bodya'**
