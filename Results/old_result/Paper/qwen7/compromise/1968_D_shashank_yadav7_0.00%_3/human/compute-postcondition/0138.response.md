Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.
