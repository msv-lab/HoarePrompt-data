Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged.
