Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`
- `k` is `-n+1`
- `b` is `p[p[...]] - n+1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`)
- `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`)
- `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations
- `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations
- The condition `bm > sm` is true

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **'Bodya'**
