Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, we can now state the modified program state for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

**State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp**
