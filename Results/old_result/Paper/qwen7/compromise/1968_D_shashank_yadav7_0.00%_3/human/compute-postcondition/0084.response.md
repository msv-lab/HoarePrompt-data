Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `k - 1`, and `b` is `p[b] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `p[b] - 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` are updated according to their respective conditions. Since `k` is decreased by 1 and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the value of `k` is now `k - 1`. The value of `p[b]` is subtracted by 1 and assigned to `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
