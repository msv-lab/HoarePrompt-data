Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` by constructing a mapping from each unique character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the alphabetically sorted version of `b`. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Character Mapping Construction**: 
   - The program first sorts the unique characters of the encoded string `b` and maps each character to its symmetric counterpart. This is done by iterating over the sorted unique characters and assigning them positions from the end of the alphabetically sorted list.
   
2. **Decoding Process**:
   - For each character in the encoded string `b`, the program uses the constructed map to find the corresponding character in the original string `s`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and longer strings correctly by ensuring the mapping is applied consistently.

Given these points, the provided solution accurately decodes the encoded strings according to the specified algorithm.
