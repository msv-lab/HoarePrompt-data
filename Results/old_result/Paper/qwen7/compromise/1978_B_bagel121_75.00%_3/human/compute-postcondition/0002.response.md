Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to the output of one test case. For each test case, if `a >= b`, it will print `n * a`. Otherwise, it will compute and print `ans + p2` where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.
