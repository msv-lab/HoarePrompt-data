Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotional conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Price Comparison**:
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, then it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is handled by the condition `if a >= b: print(n * a)`.

3. **Optimal K Calculation**:
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal value of `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the difference between `b` and `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - It then calculates the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`: `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - Finally, it adds these two profits together to get the total profit: `print(ans + p2)`.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
