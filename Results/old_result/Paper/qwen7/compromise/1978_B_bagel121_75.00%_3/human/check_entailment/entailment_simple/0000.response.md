Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If so, it directly calculates the profit as `n * a` because there's no benefit in applying the promotion.
4. If `a < b`, it calculates the optimal value of `k` which is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the total number of buns or the difference between `b` and `a` plus one.
5. It then calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
6. It also calculates the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`, stored in `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
7. Finally, it prints the total profit as `ans + p2`.

Given the logic and calculations in the program match the problem statement and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
