Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are correctly defined and handle the input as specified. `func_1` reads a line from standard input, `func_2` converts the first line to an integer, `func_3` splits and converts the second line into a list of integers, and `func_4` processes the input for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: In `func_4`, the logic correctly initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`. It then iterates over each move, updating the set `ans` to include all possible players who could have the ball after each move. This is done using modular arithmetic to account for circular movement.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code handles the edge case where `0` is in the set `ans` by replacing it with `n`. This ensures that the set only contains valid player numbers.

4. **Output**: The final output correctly prints the number of possible players and their sorted list of player numbers.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic in `func_4` appears to be correct. The program processes each test case appropriately, updates the set of possible players based on the moves, and outputs the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
