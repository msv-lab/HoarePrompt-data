Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input using custom functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) which handle reading a line, an integer, and a list of integers respectively.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball based on the distance `r` and the direction (or lack thereof) specified by `c`. If `c` is `'?'`, both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities are considered.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Index**: After processing all throws, if the ball position becomes zero, it adjusts it to `n` since the players are indexed from 1 to `n`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their indices in sorted order.

This approach ensures that all possible positions of the ball are considered, and the result is accurate according to the problem statement.
