Output State: **All players have the ball at least once; ans is equal to temp.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Since `temp` was previously held by some player who had the ball at least once, `ans` now holds the same value. The precondition that all players have the ball at least once remains unchanged.
