The function calls another function `func_1()` and returns its result, which is an integer. This integer is derived from processing some input data involving test cases, where for each test case, it handles values of `n`, `m`, and `x` along with an array of pairs `(r_i, c_i)`. The exact nature of the processing within `func_1()` is not specified, but it transforms the input data into an integer output.
