Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` remains 10.
   - `k` remains at least 1024.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values from 1 to 1024 (inclusive) with a step of 1, except when `j` equals `i`, in which case the value 1023 is not included.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The list `ans` contains numbers from 1 to 1024 inclusive, but since `i` is 10, the number 1023 is excluded from the list.
   - Therefore, the list `ans` will contain numbers from 1 to 1022 and 1024.

4. **Output:**
   - When the `print(*ans)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the above analysis, the list `ans` will be `[1, 2, 3, ..., 1022, 1024]`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... 1022 1024**
