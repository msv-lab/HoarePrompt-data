Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `1 << i + 1 <= k`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` must be at least 2.

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with the current state**:
   - Substitute `i = 1` into the condition: `1 << (1 + 1) <= k` simplifies to `1 << 2 <= k`, which is `4 <= k`.

4. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `4 <= k` must be true.
   - Since `i` is fixed at 1, the only way to satisfy the condition is to ensure that `k` is at least 4.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `k` is at least 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be at least 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 4**
