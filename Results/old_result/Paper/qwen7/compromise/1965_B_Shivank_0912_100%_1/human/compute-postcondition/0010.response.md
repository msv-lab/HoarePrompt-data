Output State: `i` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(1 \ll i + 1 \leq k\), where \(\ll\) denotes left shift operation. This means \(2^{i+1} \leq k\). After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{i+1} > k\), which is equivalent to saying `i` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The values of `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
