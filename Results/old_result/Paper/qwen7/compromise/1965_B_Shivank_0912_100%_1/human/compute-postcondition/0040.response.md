Output State: **`i` is 10; `k` is at least 1024; `ans` is `[1023, 1025, 1029]`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is set to 10, and `k` remains at least 1024. The list `ans` is calculated as follows:
- The first element is `k - (1 << i)`, which is `1024 - (1 << 10) = 1024 - 1024 = 1023`.
- The second element is `k + 1`, which is `1024 + 1 = 1025`.
- The third element is `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, which is `1024 + 1 + (1 << 10) = 1025 + 1024 = 1029`.

Therefore, the output state is `i` is 10; `k` is at least 1024; `ans` is `[1023, 1025, 1029]`.
