Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `i` remains 10.
2. `k` remains at least 1024, but this value does not directly affect the creation of the list `ans`.
3. The list `ans` is created with values from 1 to 1024 (inclusive) with a step of 1, except when `j` equals `i` (which is 10), in which case the value 1023 is not included.

Given these conditions, let's construct the list `ans`:

- The list starts from 1 and goes up to 1024.
- When `j` equals `i` (which is 10), the value 1023 is excluded from the list.

So, the list `ans` will contain all numbers from 1 to 1024 except 1023.

To find the length of `ans`, we need to count the number of elements in this list. Since there are 1024 numbers originally and one number (1023) is excluded, the length of `ans` is \(1024 - 1 = 1023\).

Output: **1023**
