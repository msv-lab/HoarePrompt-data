#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on whether the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s` is odd or even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`. If the count is odd, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for `t` test cases.
