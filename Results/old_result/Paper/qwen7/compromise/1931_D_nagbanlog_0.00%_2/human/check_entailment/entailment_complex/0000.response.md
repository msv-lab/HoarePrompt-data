### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and calculating the number of "beautiful pairs" based on the given conditions. However, there are several issues with the logic used to determine the "beautiful pairs":

1. **Modulo Calculation**: The function uses `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y` to calculate the remainders when dividing the elements of the array by `x` and `y`. This part is correct.

2. **Required Modulo Calculation**: The function calculates `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y = mod_y`. This is intended to find the required remainders for the conditions to hold true. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the divisibility conditions.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**: The function uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs. This is generally correct but the way the pairs are used to count "beautiful pairs" is incorrect.

4. **Beautiful Pair Counting**: The function increments `beautiful_count` based on the presence of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`. This is incorrect because the conditions for a "beautiful pair" are not being properly checked.

To correctly count the "beautiful pairs", we need to check both conditions simultaneously for each pair of elements in the array. Specifically, for each pair `(i, j)`:
- Check if `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0`
- Check if `(a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0`

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0 and (a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    
    return results
```

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the original function is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the provided function is:

**False**
