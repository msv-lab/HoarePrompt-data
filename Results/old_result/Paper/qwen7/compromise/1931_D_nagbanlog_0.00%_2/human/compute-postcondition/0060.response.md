Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `num` is a variable that will take on values from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a` is a list that contains elements to be iterated over.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `a`.
   - The value of `num` will change with each iteration, but initially, it doesn't matter what specific value `num` takes since the loop will start iterating as long as `a` has at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `a` has at least one element for the loop to start executing.
   - The value of `num` itself doesn't need to be specified because it will be assigned a value from `a` during the first iteration.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must have at least one element.
- `num` will be assigned a value from `a` during the first iteration, but its initial value is not relevant for the loop to start.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**`beautiful_count` is 0, `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `a` must have at least one element, and `test_cases` still contains at least one element.**
