Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is the first element of the first sublist in `test_cases` under 'params', `x` is the second element of the same sublist, `y` is the third element of the same sublist, `a` is the 'array' from the first test case, `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of `results`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new empty dictionary `freq` is added to the state.
