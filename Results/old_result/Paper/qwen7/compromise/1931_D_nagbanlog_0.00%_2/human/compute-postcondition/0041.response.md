Output State: **`a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `mod_y` (now updated), `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y` (now updated), `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.**

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` simply assigns the current value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This does not change any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the values of `a`, `beautiful_count`, `freq`, `num`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, and `mod_x` remain as they were before this line of code was executed. The only change is that `required_mod_y` now holds the same value as `mod_y`.
