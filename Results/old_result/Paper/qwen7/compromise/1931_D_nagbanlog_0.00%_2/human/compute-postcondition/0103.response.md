Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for case in test_cases`. The variables involved in the loop head are `case`.

2. **Determine the state changes for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `case` is being iterated over in `test_cases`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `case` contained a specific dictionary with keys `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.
   - For the next iteration, `case` will contain the next dictionary in `test_cases`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `case` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to update its state to reflect the next dictionary in `test_cases`.
   - The other variables (`beautiful_count`, `case['params']`, `results`, `freq`, `a`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.**
