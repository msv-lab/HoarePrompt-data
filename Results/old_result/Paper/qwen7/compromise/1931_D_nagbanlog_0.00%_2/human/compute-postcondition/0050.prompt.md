Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is the first element of the first sublist in `test_cases` under 'params', `x` is the second element of the same sublist, `y` is the third element of the same sublist, `a` is the 'array' from the first test case, `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`; `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`; `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by either `0` or `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and if `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to `0`. `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `mod_y` (now updated), `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y` (now updated), `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
