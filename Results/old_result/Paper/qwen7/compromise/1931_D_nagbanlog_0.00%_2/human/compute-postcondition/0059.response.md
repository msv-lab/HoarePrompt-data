Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`.
- `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `a` is updated to be `case['array']`.
- `test_cases` still contains at least one element.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are values from the dictionary `case['params']`.
- `a` is the value of `case['array']`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values. However, we know they exist within the context of the dictionary and the array.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]** (where [n], [x], [y], and [a] are values from the dictionary `case['params']` and `case['array']`, respectively)
