Postcondition: `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
