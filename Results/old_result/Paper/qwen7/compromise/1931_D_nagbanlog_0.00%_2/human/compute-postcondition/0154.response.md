Output State: **The program returns a list named `results` which contains the total count of beautiful pairs for all test cases processed. Each element in the list represents the `beautiful_count` for a specific test case, calculated based on the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs in the `freq` dictionary. The `beautiful_count` for each test case accumulates the count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` that exist in `freq`, representing the total number of beautiful pairs found across all test cases for that particular test case.**

This means that the program will return a list where each element corresponds to the total number of beautiful pairs found for each test case, as defined by the frequency of specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs in the `freq` dictionary.
