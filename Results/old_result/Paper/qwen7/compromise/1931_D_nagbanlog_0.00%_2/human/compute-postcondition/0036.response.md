Output State: **`a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`; `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`; `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1` increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
