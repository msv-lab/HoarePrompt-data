Output State: **`a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0` sets the value of the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
