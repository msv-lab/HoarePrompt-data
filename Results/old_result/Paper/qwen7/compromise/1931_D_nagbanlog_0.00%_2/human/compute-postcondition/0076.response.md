Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary; `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`; `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`; `mod_y` retains its original value; `required_mod_y` retains its original value; `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mod_y` to `num % y`. All other variables retain their previous values.
