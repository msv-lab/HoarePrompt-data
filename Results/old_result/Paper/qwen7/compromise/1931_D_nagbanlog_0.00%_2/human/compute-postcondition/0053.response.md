Output State: **`results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is a dictionary containing counts for all unique pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` seen throughout the iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list, and `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are no longer defined.**

This means that after the loop completes, the `results` list contains a single element, which is the `beautiful_count`. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of occurrences where the specified conditions were met during the loop iterations. The `freq` dictionary retains the counts of all unique modulus pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` observed in `a`. The list `a` is now empty, and the local variables `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are no longer in scope.
