Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is not empty, meaning it contains at least one element.
- `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

Let's break down the print statement step-by-step:

1. `num` is the next element in the list `a`. Since `a` is not empty, `num` is the first element of `a`.
2. `mod_x` is `num % x`, which means the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
3. `mod_y` is `num % y`, which means the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
4. `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`. This calculates the difference between `x` and `mod_x`, then takes the result modulo `x`.
5. `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

Given these steps, the print statement will output:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]** 

Where:
- `[num]` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `[mod_x]` is the remainder when `[num]` is divided by `x`.
- `[mod_y]` is the remainder when `[num]` is divided by `y`.
- `[required_mod_x]` is `(x - [mod_x]) % x`.
- `[required_mod_y]` is `[mod_y]`.
