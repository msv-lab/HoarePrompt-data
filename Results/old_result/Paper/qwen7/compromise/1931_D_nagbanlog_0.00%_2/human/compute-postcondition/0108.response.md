Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.
- `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.

The `print` statement will output the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]**
