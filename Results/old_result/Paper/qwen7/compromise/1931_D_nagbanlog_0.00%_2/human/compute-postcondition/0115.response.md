Postcondition: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.; `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, and `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`; `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. The tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is currently in the `freq` dictionary.**
