Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary; `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`; `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code `freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1` increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
