Output State: **`b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `s`. The variable `b` remains unchanged as it was a list of 26 zeros before the code was executed. The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it was an input integer.
