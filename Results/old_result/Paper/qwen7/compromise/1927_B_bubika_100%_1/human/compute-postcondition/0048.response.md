Output State: **`b[x]` is increased by 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is the last element in the list `s`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is 'a[x]' appended to the previous value, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `t` is incremented by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.**

The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
