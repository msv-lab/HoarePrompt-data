Output State: **`r` is 'a[x]' appended to the previous value of `r`, `i` is the first element in `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input with its elements cycled, `t` is incremented by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` appends the value of `a[x]` to the existing value of `r`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
