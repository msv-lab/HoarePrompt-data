Output State: **`b` is a list of 26 zeros.**

Explanation: The initial state sets `b` to be a list of 26 zeros. The code snippet `b = [0] * 26` does not change the fact that `b` is a list, but it explicitly initializes each of the 26 elements in the list to be zero. Therefore, the output state remains that `b` is a list of 26 zeros.
