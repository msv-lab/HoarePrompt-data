You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 1 4
    
    3 3 2 3
    
    4 2
    
    2 1 1 1
    
    4 2 3 2
    
    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by parameters \( n \), \( k \), `prices`, and `bonuses`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit by combining elements from `prices` and `bonuses` under certain conditions. It uses a heap to manage these combinations efficiently and updates the maximum profit accordingly. After processing all test cases, it prints the highest profit achieved across all cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where Bob takes `k` items for free if Alice buys more than `k` items. Instead, the program seems to focus on maximizing the profit by considering the negative prices and bonuses, but it does not properly account for Bob's strategy of taking `k` items for free.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  2 1 1 1
  4 2 3 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program does not produce the correct output. It fails to account for the fact that Bob will take 2 items for free, leaving Alice with no profit.

The program needs to correctly simulate Bob's strategy of taking `k` items for free and then calculate the remaining profit. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq
import sys

def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))

def func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap):
    total = sum((item[0] for item in secondary_heap))
    for item in primary_items:
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            total += item[0] + item[1]
    return total

def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        remaining_items = []
        (n, k) = func_2()
        prices = list(func_2())
        neg_prices = [-price for price in prices]
        bonuses = list(func_2())
        max_profit = 0
        current_profit = 0
        combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        
        # Bob takes k items for free
        for _ in range(min(k, len(combined))):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        # Calculate the profit after Bob takes k items for free
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        # Adjust the profit based on Bob's strategy
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        # Process remaining items
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(-max_profit)

func_4()
```

This corrected version ensures that Bob's strategy of taking `k` items for free is properly accounted for, leading to the correct calculation of Alice's profit.
