Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, and the values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses` are yet to be defined for each test case.**

The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the return value of the function `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `test_cases`. However, we know that `test_cases` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses` are yet to be defined within each test case.
