Output State: **`current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `test_cases` remains a positive integer, `heap` contains all elements from `combined` after each has been popped once (i.e., `k` times), `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `neg_prices` remains a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` remains a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` remains the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is now 0, `max_profit` remains 0, and `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order. The list `combined` is non-empty.**

In this step, the function `func_3` is called with `combined` and `heap` as arguments. The value returned by `func_3` is assigned to `current_profit`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
