Postcondition: `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is adjusted by either subtracting `item[1]` or adding `item[0]`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`, and `combined` must still contain at least one element.
