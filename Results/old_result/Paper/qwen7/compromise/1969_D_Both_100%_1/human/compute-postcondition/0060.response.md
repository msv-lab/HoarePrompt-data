Output State: **`item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the current value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. Since no new operations are performed on `max_profit`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`item`, `combined`, `heap`, and `current_profit`) are already described as being modified or having their values updated in the initial postcondition, so they remain as stated.
