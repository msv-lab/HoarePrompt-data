Postcondition: `max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `combined` is now a list with one item less than before (since `item = combined.pop()`), `k` is less than or equal to 0, `heap` is an empty heap, and the current value of `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.
