Output State: **`item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, `max_profit` is unchanged if `current_profit` is not greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_profit` by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it. The other variables (`item`, `combined`, `heap`, and `max_profit`) remain in their respective states as described in the initial state, with the conditions specified for `current_profit` and `max_profit`.
