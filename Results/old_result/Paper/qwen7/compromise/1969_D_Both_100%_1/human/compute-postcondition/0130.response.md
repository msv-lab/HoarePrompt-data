Output State: **`current_profit` is now `current_profit + item[0]`, `max_profit` remains equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `item` is the last item popped from `combined`.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been updated by adding the profit from the `item` just pushed. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
