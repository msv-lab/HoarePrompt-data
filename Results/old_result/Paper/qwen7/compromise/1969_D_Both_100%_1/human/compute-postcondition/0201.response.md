Postcondition: `max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, `combined` is now a list with one item less than before (since `removed_item = combined.pop()`), `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped.
