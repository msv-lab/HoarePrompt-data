Output State: **`max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` or remains 0; `current_profit` is updated to either `current_profit - item[1]` or `current_profit + item[0]`; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped; `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the heap; `combined` is now one item shorter since the last item was popped; `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from `heap`.**

This output state reflects that the `heappushpop` operation has taken place. The `heap` has been updated by pushing the `item` into it and popping an item (`removed_item`) from it. The `combined` list is one item shorter because the `item` was popped from it. The `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the `heap`. The values of `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `item`, `k`, and the structure of the `heap` have been updated accordingly.
