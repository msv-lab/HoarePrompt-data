Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple except the last one which was popped, `k` must be greater than 0, and `heap` is a heap containing the last element of the `combined` list.**

Explanation: The code pushes the last element of the `combined` list (which is a tuple) onto a heap using `heapq.heappush()`. This means that the `combined` list now has one less element, and the `heap` now contains the last element of the original `combined` list. All other variables (`max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
