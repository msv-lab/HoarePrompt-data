Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `heap` will contain the last tuple from `combined` with the last item popped, and `current_profit` will be reduced by the first element of `removed_item`. `max_profit` will be updated to the highest value between its current value and `current_profit` at each iteration. The `remaining_items` list will remain empty, `neg_prices` will still be a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` will be the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` will be a list returned by `func_2()`. The `combined` list will be empty since the loop continues as long as `combined` is not empty, and it reduces the size of `combined` by one item per iteration until it is exhausted.

In simpler terms, after running through all iterations, `heap` will hold the final item from `combined` after all operations, `current_profit` will reflect the total profit calculated after processing all items, `max_profit` will be the highest profit achieved during the process, and `combined` will be empty.
