Output State: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to be equal to the current value of `current_profit`. Since `current_profit` was initially greater than `max_profit`, after this assignment, `max_profit` will also be equal to `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
