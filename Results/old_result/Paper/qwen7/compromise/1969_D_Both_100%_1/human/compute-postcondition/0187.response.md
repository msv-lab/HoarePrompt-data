The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, the state is:
- `max_profit` remains 0
- `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty
- `combined` is an empty list
- `k` is less than or equal to 0
- `heap` is an empty heap

For the loop to execute the first time, `combined` must be non-empty. Since `combined` is initially an empty list, it needs to be adjusted to be non-empty.

State: **`max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, `combined` is a non-empty list, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap**
