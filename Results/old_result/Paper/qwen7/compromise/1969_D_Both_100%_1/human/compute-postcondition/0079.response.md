Output State: **`combined` is fully processed, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the highest profit, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `heap = []` initializes an empty list for the variable `heap`. All other variables (`combined`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
