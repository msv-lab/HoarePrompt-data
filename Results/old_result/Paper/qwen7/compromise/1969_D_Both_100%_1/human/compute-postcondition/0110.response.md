Postcondition: `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is now one item shorter. The current value of `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.
