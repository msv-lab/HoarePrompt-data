Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop continues as long as the list `combined` is not empty.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`.
   - `max_profit` remains equal to `current_profit`.
   - `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`).
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list.
   - `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.
   - `n` is the return value of `func_2()`.
   - `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`.
   - `combined` is now two items shorter.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to continue, `combined` must not be empty. Since `combined` is currently two items shorter, it must have at least three items left for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `combined` to ensure it has at least three items remaining.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, `max_profit` remains equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` must have at least three items remaining**.
