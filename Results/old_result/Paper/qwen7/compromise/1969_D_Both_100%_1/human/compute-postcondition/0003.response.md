Output State: **`test_cases` must be a positive integer, n, k, prices, and bonuses must be defined for each test case; `heap` is an empty list; `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `remaining_items`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `bonuses`, or `heap`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
