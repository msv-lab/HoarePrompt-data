Output State: **`item` is the last element of `combined` - 1, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is updated by adding `item[0]` to its previous value, `max_profit` is unchanged if `current_profit` is not greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.**

This means that the `item` variable now refers to the second-to-last element of the `combined` list since one element has been removed. The `current_profit` has been updated by adding `item[0]` to its previous value. All other conditions and values remain as described in the initial state, with `max_profit` only being updated if `current_profit` exceeds it.
