Output State: **`current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` must be a positive integer, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.**

The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order. The sorting does not affect the values of other variables.
