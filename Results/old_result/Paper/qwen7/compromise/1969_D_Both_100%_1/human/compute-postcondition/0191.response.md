Output State: **`max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is the value of `current_profit - item[1]`, `combined` is now a list with one item less than before (since `item = combined.pop()`), `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap. The value of `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

This means that `current_profit` has been decreased by the value of `item[1]`. All other variables remain in their previous states, with `combined` having one item removed, `k` remaining less than or equal to 0, and `heap` being an empty heap.
