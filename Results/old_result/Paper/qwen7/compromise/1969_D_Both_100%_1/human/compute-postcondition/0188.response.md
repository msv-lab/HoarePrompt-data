Output State: **`max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `combined` is now a list with one item less than before (since `item = combined.pop()`), `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap.**

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` removes the last item from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. Since `combined` was initially non-empty, it now contains one less item. All other variables (`max_profit`, `current_profit`, `k`, and `heap`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
