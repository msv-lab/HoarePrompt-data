Output State: **`max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is not None; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped; `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the heap.**

Explanation: The code `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. This does not change the value of `current_profit`, nor does it affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `current_profit`, `item`, `k`, `heap`, and `removed_item` remain unchanged from their initial states.
