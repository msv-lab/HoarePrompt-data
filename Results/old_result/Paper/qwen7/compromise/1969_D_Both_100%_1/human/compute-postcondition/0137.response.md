Output State: **`current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), and `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` assigns the current value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. No other variables are affected, so the conditions regarding `heap` and `remaining_items` remain unchanged.
