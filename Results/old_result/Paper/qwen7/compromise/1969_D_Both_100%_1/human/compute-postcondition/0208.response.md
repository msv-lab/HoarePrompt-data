Output State: **`max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` or remains 0; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; and `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped.**

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` pops the last item from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. The other variables (`max_profit`, `current_profit`, `k`, and `heap`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
