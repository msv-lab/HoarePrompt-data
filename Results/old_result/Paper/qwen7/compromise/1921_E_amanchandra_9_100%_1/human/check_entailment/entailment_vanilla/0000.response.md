### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips for each test case.

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if Alice's initial row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's initial row position (`c`).
   - If `a > c`, it directly prints "Draw". This condition is correct because if Alice starts in a higher row, she cannot win since Bob can always move up and avoid being captured by Alice.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - If `a <= c`, the program proceeds to calculate the number of moves `x` required for Alice to reach Bob's row.
   - It then calculates the possible range of columns `l` and `r` where Alice can be after `x` moves.
   - The program checks if Bob can be within this range in such a way that he can avoid capture by Alice.

4. **Detailed Logic:**
   - The logic for determining whether Alice can capture Bob involves checking if Bob can stay outside the range `[l, r]` after `x` moves.
   - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, it means Alice needs an odd number of moves to reach Bob's row. In this case, the program calculates the exact range and checks if Bob can be within `x+1` columns away from the boundary.
   - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is false, it means Alice needs an even number of moves to reach Bob's row. The program calculates a different range and checks if Bob can be within `x` columns away from the boundary.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - Based on the above calculations, the program decides whether Alice can capture Bob or not and prints the appropriate result ("Draw", "Alice", or "Bob").

### Correctness Analysis:

The logic in the program seems to follow the rules of the game correctly. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

1. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program assumes that Alice and Bob can only move within the boundaries of the board. This is correctly handled in the calculations of `l` and `r`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where Alice starts in a higher row by directly printing "Draw".
   - The program also handles the case where Alice and Bob need an odd or even number of moves to reach each other's row correctly.

3. **Column Range Calculation:**
   - The calculation of the column range `[l, r]` is correct, ensuring that Alice can only move within the allowed bounds.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program correctly determines whether Bob can avoid being captured by Alice based on the calculated ranges.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
