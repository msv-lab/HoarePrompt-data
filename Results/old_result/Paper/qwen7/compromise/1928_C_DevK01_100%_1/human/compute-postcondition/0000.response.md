Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. Both `q` and `x` satisfy 1 ≤ `x` < `q` ≤ 10^9; `M` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `M`. The values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
