Based on the initial state provided, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES'.

Since the value of `n` is equal to the value of `k`, and no other variables or objects are involved in the print statement, the output will be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
