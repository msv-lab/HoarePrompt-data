Output State: **`h` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `h` to 0. No changes are made to `n`, `k`, or the `costs` list. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as their initial states.
