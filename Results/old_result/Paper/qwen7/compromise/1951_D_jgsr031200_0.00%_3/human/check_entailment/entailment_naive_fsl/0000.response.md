Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**: The program attempts to calculate the number of stalls and their respective prices but does not properly ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   2
   7 3
   6 4
   ```

   - For the first test case (`7 3`), the program outputs:
     ```
     YES
     1
     4
     ```
     However, this is incorrect because Alice would buy 1 jewel at a cost of 4 coins, leaving her with 3 coins, which is not enough to buy any more jewels. Therefore, Alice would only buy 1 jewel, not 3.

   - For the second test case (`6 4`), the program outputs:
     ```
     YES
     2
     3 2
     ```
     This is also incorrect because Alice would buy 2 jewels at a cost of 3 coins each, leaving her with 0 coins, and then buy 2 more jewels at a cost of 2 coins each, leaving her with 2 coins, which is not enough to buy another jewel. Therefore, Alice would only buy 4 jewels, but the program incorrectly states that she buys exactly 4 jewels.

2. **General Logic Flaw**: The program does not handle the general case where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels across multiple stalls. It attempts to use a greedy approach but fails to ensure that the total number of jewels bought equals `k`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
