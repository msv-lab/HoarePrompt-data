Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `m` must be greater than `k + 1`.
   - `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation.
   - `a` is increased by `f`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `k + 1` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than `k + 2` (since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).

5. **State the new conditions**:
   - `i` will be `k + 2`.
   - `m` must be greater than `k + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `m` must be greater than `k + 2`**
