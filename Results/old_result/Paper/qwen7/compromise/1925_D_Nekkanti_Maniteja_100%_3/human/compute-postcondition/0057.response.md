Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `k + 1`.
   - `m` is the initial input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `m`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initially `k + 1`, we need to ensure that `k + 1 < m` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The values of `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m` such that `i < m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`**
