Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `k + 1`, and `m` must still be greater than `k + 1`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers obtained from the input.
