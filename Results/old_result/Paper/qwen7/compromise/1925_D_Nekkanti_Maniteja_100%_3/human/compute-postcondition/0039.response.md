Output State: **`a` is `a + f`, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `i` is `m`, `k` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `u` is updated with the first input integer, `v` is updated with the second input integer, `f` is updated with the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
