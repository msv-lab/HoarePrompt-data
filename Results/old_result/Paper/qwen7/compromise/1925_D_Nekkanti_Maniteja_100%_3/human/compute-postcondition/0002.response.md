Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `M` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which evaluates to `1000000007`. This value does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, their ranges remain unchanged.
