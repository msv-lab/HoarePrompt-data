Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n` is the initial input integer, `m` is the initial input integer, `k` is the initial input integer, `i` is `k + 1`, `s` is 0, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, and `a` is the sum of `f` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`.**

Explanation: The line `s = 0` initializes `s` to 0. All other variables (`M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `c`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
