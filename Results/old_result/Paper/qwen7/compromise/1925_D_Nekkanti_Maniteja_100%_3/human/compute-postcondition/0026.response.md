Output State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` added for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=m-1`, `i` is `m`, `k` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with the unchanged values of `u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, and `i`.
