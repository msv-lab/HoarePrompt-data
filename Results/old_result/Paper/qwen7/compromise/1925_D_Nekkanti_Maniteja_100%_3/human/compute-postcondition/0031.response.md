Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `m`.
   - `m` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `m`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `m` initially.
   - Given that `i` is set to `m` initially, the loop will not execute because `i` is equal to `m`, not less than `m`.

5. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `i` must be set to a value less than `m`.

6. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - `i` should be set to a value less than `m` (e.g., `i = m - 1`).
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is an input integer**
