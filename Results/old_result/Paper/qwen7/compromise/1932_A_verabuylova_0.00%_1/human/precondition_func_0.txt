t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The second line of each test case is a string of n characters where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', representing an empty cell, a cell with a coin, and a cell with thorns, respectively, and it is guaranteed that the first cell is empty.
