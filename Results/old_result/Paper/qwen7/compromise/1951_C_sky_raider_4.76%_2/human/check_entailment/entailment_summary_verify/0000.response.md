### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements and the given function summary.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Dynamic Pricing Rule**: The price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on a given day.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)
   - \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\)
   - \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\)
   - \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))
```

1. **Sorting the List**: The list `l` is sorted, but sorting doesn't help in minimizing the cost since the order of purchasing tickets matters.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The line `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is used to update the cumulative cost `c`. This formula is incorrect because it does not reflect the dynamic pricing rule. The term `- s * s / 2` is irrelevant here.
3. **Purchasing Tickets**: The variable `s` is set to `min(m, k)` and then subtracted from `k`, but this does not reflect the actual purchase process where the price increases dynamically.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate through the days in reverse order.
2. Keep track of the remaining tickets to be purchased.
3. For each day, determine how many tickets can be purchased without exceeding the remaining tickets and the maximum limit `m`.
4. Update the remaining tickets and the cumulative cost accordingly.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the input:
```
3 2 5
8 6 4 2
```

- Day 1: Can buy up to 2 tickets (since \(m = 2\)).
  - Buy 2 tickets (cost = 2 * 8 = 16). Remaining tickets = 5 - 2 = 3.
  - Prices for the next days become [4, 3, 2].
- Day 2: Can buy up to 2 tickets.
  - Buy 2 tickets (cost = 2 * 4 = 8). Remaining tickets = 3 - 2 = 1.
  - Prices for the next days become [2, 1].
- Day 3: Can buy 1 ticket.
  - Buy 1 ticket (cost = 1 * 2 = 2). Remaining tickets = 1 - 1 = 0.

Total cost = 16 + 8 + 2 = 26.

The provided program does not handle this correctly due to the incorrect cost calculation and the lack of dynamic pricing rule handling.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: False**
