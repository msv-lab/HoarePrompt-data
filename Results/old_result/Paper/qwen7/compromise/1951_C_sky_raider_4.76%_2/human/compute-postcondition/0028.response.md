Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

The code `s = min(m, k)` assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`. Since the initial states of `i` and `n` are unchanged, they remain as `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `s` is now assigned the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
