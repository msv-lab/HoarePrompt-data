Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - This means that `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the loop has completed all its iterations.

2. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is now equal to `n`, the loop condition `i < n` is no longer true, and the loop will not execute again.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head. Since `i` is now equal to `n`, we need to update `i` to `n + 1` to prepare for the next iteration if it were to occur.
   - However, since the loop does not execute again, `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Expression for `c`**:
   - The expression `c` is the cumulative sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - Since the loop has completed, `c` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which will not occur) would be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`**.

However, since the loop does not execute again, the actual state at the start of the next iteration (which does not happen) would be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`**.

But practically, since the loop does not execute again, the final state remains:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`**.
