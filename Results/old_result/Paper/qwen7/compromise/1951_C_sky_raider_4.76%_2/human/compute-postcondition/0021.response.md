Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the input value, which is used to determine the range of the loop. The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is less than or equal to 0.
   - `m` remains the same as the initial value.
   - `s` remains the same as the initial value.
   - `l` remains the same as the initial sorted list of integers.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`.

4. **Ensure Other Conditions**: Since the loop is dependent on the input value, which is read at the beginning and used to set the range, the input value (which determines `n`) should remain unchanged. The other variables (`c`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `l`) should retain their current values unless explicitly modified within the loop, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they remain the same.

5. **Formulate the New State**: Based on the above points, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `c` remains the same as the sum calculated in the previous iterations.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `k` remains less than or equal to 0.
   - `m` remains the same as the initial value.
   - `s` remains the same as the initial value.
   - `l` remains the same as the initial sorted list of integers.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to 0, `m` remains the same as the initial value, `s` remains the same as the initial value, and `l` remains the same as the initial sorted list of integers.**
