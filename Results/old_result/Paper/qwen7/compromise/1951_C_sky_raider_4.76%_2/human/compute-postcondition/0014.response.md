Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `c` is `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0 (as it was initially).

5. **Adjust the State**: The only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we update `i` to 2 and ensure `n` remains greater than 0.

6. **Consider the Expression for `c`**: The expression for `c` does not change based on the loop itself but rather on the loop body, which is omitted. Thus, we do not need to adjust the value of `c` explicitly in this context.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
