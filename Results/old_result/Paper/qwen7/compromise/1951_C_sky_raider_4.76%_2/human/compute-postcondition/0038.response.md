Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `c` is `c + l[2] * s - s * s / 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding the value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. Given that `i` is 2, the expression becomes `c += l[2] * s - s * s / 2`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
