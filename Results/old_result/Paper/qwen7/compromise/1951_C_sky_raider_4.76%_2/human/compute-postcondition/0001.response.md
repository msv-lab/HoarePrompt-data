Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `i` was initially set to 0 and remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with the unchanged value of `i`.
