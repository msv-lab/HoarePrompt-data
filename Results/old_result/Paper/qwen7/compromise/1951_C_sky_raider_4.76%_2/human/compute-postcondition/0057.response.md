Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `c` is `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `s` is `min(m, k)`**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the minimum value between `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
