Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), where t is an integer within the range [1, 10^4], n is an integer within the range [1, 3⋅10^5], m is an integer within the range [1, 10^9], k is an integer within the range [1, min(n⋅m, 10^9)], and a is a list of n integers each within the range [1, 10^9]. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes each test case according to the given constraints.**
