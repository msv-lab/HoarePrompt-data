Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each step, and `k` decreases by the value of `s` with each iteration. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 ensures the loop runs at least once.
