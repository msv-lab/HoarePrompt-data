Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values and conditions**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `m` is the second integer input (not used in the loop).
   - `k` is the third integer input (not used in the loop).
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input split by spaces (not used in the loop).
   - `s` is 0 (not used in the loop).
   - `c` is `k * k / 2` (not used in the loop).

3. **Conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
