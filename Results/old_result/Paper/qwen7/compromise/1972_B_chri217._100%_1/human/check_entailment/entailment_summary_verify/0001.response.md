### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the input and stores the test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `(n, s)` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of coins that are facing up (`ups`).
   - The function checks if the count of facing-up coins (`ups`) is even. If it is even, it returns `'YES'`, indicating that Alice will win; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - According to the problem statement, the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins. The key observation here is that the parity (even or odd) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob, ensuring her eventual victory. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by always leaving an even number of facing-up coins for her.

4. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The logic implemented in `func_2` correctly identifies whether Alice or Bob will win based on the initial number of facing-up coins.
   - However, the implementation of `func_2` is flawed because it only considers the initial state of the coins and does not simulate the actual game process. The game involves removing coins and flipping adjacent coins, which affects the state of the remaining coins. Therefore, simply counting the number of "U" characters in the string `s` is not sufficient to determine the winner.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case with `n = 5` and `s = "UUDUD"`.
     - Initial state: "UUDUD"
     - After Alice's first move (removing the first "U" and flipping adjacent coins): "DDUU"
     - After Bob's first move (removing the last "U" and flipping adjacent coins): "UDD"
     - After Alice's second move (removing the first "U" and flipping adjacent coins): "UU"
     - After Bob's second move (removing the first "U" and flipping adjacent coins): "U"
     - Alice's third move (removing the last "U"): empty string
     - Bob cannot make a move and loses the game.
   - In this example, the initial number of "U" characters is 3 (odd), but Alice still wins because she can force Bob into a losing position through optimal play.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game. The function `func_2` only considers the initial state and does not simulate the game process, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
