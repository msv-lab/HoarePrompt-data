Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins `n` and the string `s`.
   - The function returns this list of tuples, which is correctly passed to `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a single argument `case`, which is a tuple containing the number of coins `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calculates the number of coins facing up (`ups`) by counting the occurrences of 'U' in the string `s`.
   - It then determines the winner based on whether the count of 'U' is even or odd:
     - If the count of 'U' is even, it returns 'YES'.
     - If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It processes each test case by calculating the number of coins facing up and determining the winner based on the parity of this count.
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
