Functionality: **The function reads a specified number of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. It then constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer `n` and the string `s`. Finally, it returns this list of tuples.**
