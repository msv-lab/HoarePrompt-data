Output State: **The program returns a list called 'cases' which contains 't' tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer 'n' and a string 's', where 'n' is an integer read from standard input and 's' is a string read from standard input for each of the 't' test cases.**

This means that for each of the 't' test cases, the program will take an integer 'n' and a string 's' as input and store them as a tuple (n, s) in the list 'cases'. The final output is the list 'cases' containing these tuples.
