#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), with \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `freq` is a list of integers where each index `i` (with \(0 \le i < n\)) contains the frequency of `i` in the original list `arr`. All other elements in `freq` up to index `n` are still zeros.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: Output State: cou is 0, freq is a list where the value at each index i (with \(0 \le i < n\)) represents the frequency of i in the original list arr, and all other elements in freq up to index n are still zeros. The loop will print and break when it finds the first number with either a frequency of 1 or 0, and cou will remain 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers and checks if all elements in the list are unique within the given range. It creates a frequency list to count occurrences of each element. If it finds any element with a frequency of 1 or 0, it prints and breaks from the loop. If no such element is found, it continues checking until the end. The function does not explicitly return a value but may print elements based on their frequencies.
