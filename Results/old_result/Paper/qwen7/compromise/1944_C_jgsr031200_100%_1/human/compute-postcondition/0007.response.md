Output State: cou is 0, freq is a list where the value at each index i (with \(0 \le i < n\)) represents the frequency of i in the original list arr, and all other elements in freq up to index n are still zeros. The loop will print and break when it finds the first number with either a frequency of 1 or 0, and cou will remain 0.
