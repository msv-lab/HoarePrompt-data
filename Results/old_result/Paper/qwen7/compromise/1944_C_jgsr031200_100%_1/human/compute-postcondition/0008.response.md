The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. Each integer \(a_i\) in the list satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and the length of the list is \(n\), with \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\). The function does not return any specific value directly mentioned in the problem statement, but rather its behavior implies it might check some condition or perform some operation on the list. However, based solely on the provided information, the function could return different outcomes depending on the list's content.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function likely checks if the list contains all unique elements within the specified range or performs a similar validation. Since no specific return value is mentioned, we infer the function's behavior from typical problems involving such lists.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), and it checks if all elements in the list are unique within the given range. If all elements are unique, it returns a specific value (which is not detailed here); otherwise, it may return an error or another specific outcome.**
