### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` to achieve a specific game score, which is the MEX of the array `c`. Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - If there are even occurrences of any number in `a`, Alice can always ensure that the MEX of `c` is at least 2 by picking those numbers in her turns.
   - If there are odd occurrences of any number in `a`, Bob can ensure that the MEX of `c` is at most 1 by removing those numbers in his turns.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX of `c` based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob.
   - The function `func_1` is not designed to handle the game logic as described. Instead, it seems to be counting frequencies of elements in `arr` and printing the first number that appears exactly once or not at all, which is not relevant to the MEX calculation in the context of the game.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to count the frequencies of each number in `arr`.
   - Determine the highest frequency of any number in `arr`.
   - Based on whether this frequency is even or odd, decide the MEX:
     - If the highest frequency is even, the MEX will be 2.
     - If the highest frequency is odd, the MEX will be 1.
   - If no number appears more than once, the MEX will be 0.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not implement the correct logic to determine the MEX based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
