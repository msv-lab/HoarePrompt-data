Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Game Mechanics Not Fully Considered**: The solution does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. It simply counts the frequency of elements in the array and prints the first element that appears only once or twice. This approach does not account for the optimal moves of both players.

2. **Incorrect Output**: The output should be the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The current implementation does not simulate the game and thus cannot produce the correct MEX value.

3. **Missing Functionality**: The commented-out code at the beginning of the script is not used in the actual solution. This suggests that the solution might be incomplete or incorrectly implemented.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the game according to the rules provided and ensure that both players play optimally. Here's a more appropriate approach:

```python
def find_mex(arr):
    mex = 0
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num == mex:
            mex += 1
        elif num < mex:
            mex += 1
        seen.add(num)
    return mex

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Alice's turn
    alice_turns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            alice_turns.append(arr[i])
        else:
            arr.remove(arr[i])
    
    # Bob's turn
    bob_turns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            bob_turns.append(arr[i])
        else:
            arr.remove(arr[i])
    
    # Combine turns to form the final array c
    c = alice_turns + bob_turns
    print(find_mex(c))
```

This solution simulates the turns of Alice and Bob and then calculates the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
