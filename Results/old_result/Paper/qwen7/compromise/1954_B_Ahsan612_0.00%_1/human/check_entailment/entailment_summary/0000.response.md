Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array, which is not relevant to determining whether the array can become non-beautiful by removing elements. Instead, the program should identify the minimum number of elements to remove such that the array cannot be made beautiful by the specified operation.

Here's a breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program counts the maximum number of consecutive identical elements (`same`), but this does not help in determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

2. **No Removal Strategy**: The program does not implement a strategy to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. It simply finds the longest sequence of identical elements and prints the length of this sequence, which is not useful for solving the problem.

3. **No Handling of Non-Beautiful Arrays**: The program does not handle the scenario where the array is already non-beautiful or needs specific elements removed to break the beauty condition.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the indices where the beauty condition holds true.
- Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break these conditions.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
