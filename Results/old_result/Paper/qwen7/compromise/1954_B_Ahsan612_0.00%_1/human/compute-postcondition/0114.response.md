Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 2 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it remains 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `minn`, `same`, and `num` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
