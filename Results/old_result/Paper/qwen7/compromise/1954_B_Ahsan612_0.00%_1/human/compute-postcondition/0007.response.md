Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while i < len(ar)`. The only variables involved are `i` and `len(ar)`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `i < len(ar)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1. 

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**
