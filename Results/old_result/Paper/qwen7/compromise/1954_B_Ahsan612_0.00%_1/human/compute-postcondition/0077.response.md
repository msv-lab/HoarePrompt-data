Output State: **`i` is either 5 or 6, `same` is either 2 (if `ar[4]` equals `num`) or 1 (if `ar[4]` does not equal `num`), `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 4 or 5, incrementing it by 1 results in `i` being either 5 or 6. The values of `same`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
