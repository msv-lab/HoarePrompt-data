Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 4 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `i` must be less than `len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. If the current element matches the first element (`num`), then `same` was initially 3, so now it becomes 4. If the current element does not match the first element, then `same` was initially 2, so it remains 2. The other variables (`minn`, `num`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
