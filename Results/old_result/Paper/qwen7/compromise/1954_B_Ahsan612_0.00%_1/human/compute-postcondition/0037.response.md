Output State: **`i` is either 6 or 7, `same` is at least 1, `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and 1, and `num` is equal to `ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was either 5 or 6. After incrementing, `i` becomes either 6 or 7. The values of `same`, `minn`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, except that `same` is still at least 1, `minn` is now the minimum between `minn` and 1 (since `same` is at least 1), and `num` is equal to `ar[i]` (which is now `ar[6]` or `ar[7]` depending on the original value of `i`).
