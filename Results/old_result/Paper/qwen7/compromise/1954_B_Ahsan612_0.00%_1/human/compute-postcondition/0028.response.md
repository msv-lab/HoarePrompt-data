Output State: **`i` is either 5 or 6; `same` is at least 1; `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that `i` was either 4 or 5 initially, after executing the code, `i` will be either 5 or 6. The values of `same` and `minn` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
