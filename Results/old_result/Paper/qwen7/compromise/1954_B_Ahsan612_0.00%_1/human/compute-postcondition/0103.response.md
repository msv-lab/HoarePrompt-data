Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `minn` is set to infinity.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `i` is less than `len(ar)`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**
