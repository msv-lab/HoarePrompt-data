Output State: **`i` is 5, `same` is either incremented by 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or remains 1 if it is not, and `num` is now `ar[i]` which is `ar[5]`.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given that `i` is 5, `num` is now `ar[5]`. The values of `i` and `same` remain unchanged from their initial state unless `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, in which case `same` would be incremented by 1.
