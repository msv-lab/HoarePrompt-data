Output State: **`i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 2. The other variables (`same`, `num`, `minn`, and the condition involving `ar[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
