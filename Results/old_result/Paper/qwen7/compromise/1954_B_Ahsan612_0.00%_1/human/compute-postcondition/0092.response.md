Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`.
- `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found.
- `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value.
- `minn` is not equal to infinity.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information:

1. `minn` is not equal to infinity, so it must have been initialized to some finite value.
2. `same` is set to 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value. This implies that `same` is 1, meaning no further elements were matched.
3. Since `same` is 1, it means that `num` was set to the last `min(minn, same)` value, and this value is the minimum value found so far because `same` is 1 (indicating no change).

Given these points, `minn` will be the last minimum value found, which is the same as `num`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `minn`.

Output: **minn (the last minimum value found)**
