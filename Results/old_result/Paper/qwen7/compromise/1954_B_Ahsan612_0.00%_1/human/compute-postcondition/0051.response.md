Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers created from input, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in `ar`, `num` is the last number in `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `ar`. The variable `i` is updated to be the length of the list `ar`. All other variables (`same`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged as they were not directly affected by this line of code. The variable `n` remains an input integer as it was not modified.
