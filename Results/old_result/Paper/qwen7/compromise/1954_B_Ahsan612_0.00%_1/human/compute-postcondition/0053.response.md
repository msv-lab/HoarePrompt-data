Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers created from input, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1, `num` is now the first element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.
