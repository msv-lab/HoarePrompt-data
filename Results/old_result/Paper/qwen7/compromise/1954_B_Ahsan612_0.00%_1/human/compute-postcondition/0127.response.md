Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 2, `num` is the element at index `i+1` in the list `ar`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Since `i` was previously increased by 1, the new value of `num` is now the element at index `i+1`. The values of `minn` and `same` remain unchanged from their initial states.
