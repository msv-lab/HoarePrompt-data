Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `num` is the third element of the list `ar`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. Since the initial value of `same` was also `1`, the assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`minn`, `num`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
