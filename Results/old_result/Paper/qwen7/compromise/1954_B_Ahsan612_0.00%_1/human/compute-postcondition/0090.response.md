Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`.
- `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found.
- `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value.
- `minn` is equal to infinity.

Given these conditions, let's break down the steps:

1. Initially, `minn` is set to infinity.
2. `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found. Since `minn` is initially infinity, `min(minn, same)` would be `same` (assuming `same` is a finite value).
3. After setting `num`, `same` is checked. If no further elements were matched, `same` is set to 1.
4. Therefore, `same` is now 1.
5. `minn` is then updated to the minimum value between its current value (infinity) and `same` (which is 1). So, `minn` becomes 1.

Now, the code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
