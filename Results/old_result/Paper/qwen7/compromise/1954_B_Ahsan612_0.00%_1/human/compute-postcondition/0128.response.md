Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value between 1 and `same`, `same` is 2, `num` is the element at index `i+1` in the list `ar`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`minn`) and `same`. Since `same` is 2, `minn` will be updated to 1 if `minn` is greater than 1, otherwise `minn` remains unchanged. The values of `same`, `num`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code.
