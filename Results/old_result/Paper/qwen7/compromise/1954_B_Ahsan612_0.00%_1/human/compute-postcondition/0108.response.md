Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 3, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so now `i` is 3. The values of `minn`, `same`, `num`, and `len(ar)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
