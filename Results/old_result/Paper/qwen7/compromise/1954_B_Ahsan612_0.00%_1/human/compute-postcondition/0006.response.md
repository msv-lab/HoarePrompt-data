Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
