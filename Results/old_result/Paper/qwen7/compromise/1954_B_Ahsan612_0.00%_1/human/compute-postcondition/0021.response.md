Output State: **`i` is 4; `same` is increased by 1**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4. The variable `same` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified in the initial state, so we only know that it has been increased by 1. The precondition that `len(ar)` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
