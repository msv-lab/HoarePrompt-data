Output State: `minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is the total count of consecutive occurrences of the first element `num` in the list `ar`, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `minn` will hold the minimum value between 1 and the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element `num` found in the list `ar`. The variable `same` will store the total count of consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list, as the loop resets `same` to 1 whenever it encounters a different element but updates `minn` with the minimum count found so far.
