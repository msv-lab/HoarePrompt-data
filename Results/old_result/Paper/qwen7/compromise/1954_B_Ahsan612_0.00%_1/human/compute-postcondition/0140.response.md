Postcondition: `minn` is the minimum value between the initial value of `minn` (either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1) and `same`; `same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the list `ar`, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was checked (which will be different from the first element if there was a change), `i` is equal to `len(ar)`. If `minn` was initially infinity, it is now updated to a finite value. Otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged.
