You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

    2

    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function processes two binary strings, `a` and `b`, of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It counts the number of times a character from string `a` is found in string `b` within the first `m` characters. The function returns the count (`k`), the original value of `t`, the final value of `n` after processing, the final value of `m` after processing, the original string `a`, the original string `b`, and the final value of `j` after processing. If no characters from `a` are found in `b`, `k` is 0; otherwise, `k` is greater than 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m`, and the binary strings `a` and `b`.
3. **Initialization**: It initializes variables `k` and `j` to 0. `k` will store the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will be used to iterate through `b`.
4. **Main Logic**: 
   - It iterates through each character of `a` using index `i`.
   - Inside the loop, it uses a while loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - If `a[i]` is found in `b` at some position `j`, it increments `k` and moves `j` to the next position after `b[j]`.
   - If `a[i]` is not found in `b` from the current position `j` to the end, it breaks out of the loop.
5. **Output**: After processing all characters of `a`, it prints the value of `k`.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- The use of `while` loop ensures that only the required characters are checked in `b` for each character in `a`.
- The termination condition (`break` statement) ensures that the loop stops when a mismatch is found, which is correct for finding the longest prefix.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**
