Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` correctly reads the lengths of the strings `n` and `m`, followed by the strings `a` and `b`. This part of the code is correct.

2. **Logic for Finding Subsequence**: The logic inside the loop iterates through each character of `a` and checks if it matches any character in `b`. If a match is found, it increments `k` and moves to the next character in `b`. This ensures that we are finding the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where the character from `a` is not found in `b` by breaking out of the loop and setting `k` to the last valid count. This is correctly implemented.

4. **Output**: The function prints the value of `k`, which is the required output.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum prefix length of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. There are no apparent errors or omissions in the code that would cause it to produce incorrect results based on the problem description and the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
