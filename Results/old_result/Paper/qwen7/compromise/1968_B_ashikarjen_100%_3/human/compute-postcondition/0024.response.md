Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The variables that affect the loop condition are `j` and `m`.
3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `k` is 0.
   - `m` must be at least 3.
   - `j` is increased by 1 (implying `j` has been incremented from some previous value).

4. **Check the loop condition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Since `j` is increased by 1, let's assume `j` was `j-1` before the increment.
   - For the loop to continue, `j < m` must be true, and `b[j] != a[i]` must also be true.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to continue. Since `j` was increased by 1, `j` must be less than `m` now.
   - `m` must be at least 3 as given in the initial state.
   - `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` for the loop to continue.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is 0, `m` must be at least 3, `j` must be less than `m` and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
