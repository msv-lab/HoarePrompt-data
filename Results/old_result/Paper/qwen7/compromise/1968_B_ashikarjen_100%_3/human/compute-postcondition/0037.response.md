Postcondition: `k` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is less than `m`, and `b[j]` is never equal to `a[i]` for any index `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` becomes 1 and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited, maintaining the original conditions.
