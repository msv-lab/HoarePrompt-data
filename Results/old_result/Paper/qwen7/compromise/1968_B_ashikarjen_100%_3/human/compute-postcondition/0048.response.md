Output State: **`k` is 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is less than `m`, and `b[j]` is never equal to `a[i]` for any index `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`. Additionally, `j` is less than `m`.**

The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The conditions involving `m`, `j`, and the relationship between `b[j]` and `a[i]` remain unchanged.
