Output State: **`k` is 0, `m` must be at least 3, `j` is less than `m`, and `j` is increased by 1.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, while the values of `k`, `m`, and the condition involving `b[j]` and `a[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `j` has been increased by 1, but the other conditions and values are preserved from the initial state.
