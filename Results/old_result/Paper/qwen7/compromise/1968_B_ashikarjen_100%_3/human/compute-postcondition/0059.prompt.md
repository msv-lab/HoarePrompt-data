You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on whether the condition `b[j] == a[i]` was met for any `i` in the range of `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the final value it was set to after the loop, `a` is the first line of input, `b` is a string input, and `j` is the final value it was set to after the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `k` will be incremented each time the character `a[i]` is found in the string `b` up to index `m-1`. If `a[i]` is found for any `i` in the range of `n`, `k` will be greater than 0; otherwise, it will remain 0. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The value of `n` and `m` will be the final values they were set to after the loop completes. The variables `a` and `b` will retain their input values, and `j` will be the final value it was set to after the loop exits.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is 0 if no characters from a are found in b within the specified range, and greater than 0 if at least one character from a is found in b)
    return
    #The program returns k which is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on whether the condition b[j] == a[i] was met for any i in the range of n, t which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n which is the final value it was set to after the loop, m which is the final value it was set to after the loop, a which retains its input value, b which retains its input value, and j which is the final value it was set to after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes variables t, n, m, a, and b where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n and m are integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The function returns k (either 0 or greater than 0), t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (final value after processing), m (final value after processing), a (retains its input value), b (retains its input value), and j (final value after processing).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns k which is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on whether the condition b[j] == a[i] was met for any i in the range of n, t which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n which is the final value it was set to after the loop, m which is the final value it was set to after the loop, a which retains its input value, b which retains its input value, and j which is the final value it was set to after the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
