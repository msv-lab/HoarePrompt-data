Output State: **`can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is `n * health`, `total_bullets_needed` is `n * health`, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples with all tuples processed, `distance` is `abs(pos)` for the last processed tuple, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `x`. The other variables (`can_survive`, `bullets_used`, `total_bullets_needed`, `t`, `k`, `monsters`, `distance`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
