Output State: **`can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is 2 * health, `total_bullets_needed` is 2 * health, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples that now contains at least two tuples, and the first tuple being processed is the second tuple in the list, `distance` is abs(pos) for the new first tuple.**

This means that after executing the line `distance = abs(pos)`, the value of `distance` is set to the absolute value of the position (`pos`) of the new first tuple in the `monsters` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
