Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used + health + next_health`, `t` is `t - 1`, `distance` is recalculated as `abs(next_pos)`, `pos` and `health` are updated to the next tuple in the `monsters` list, `bullets_used` is updated to `bullets_used + health + next_health, distance is calculated as abs(pos), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of `can_survive`, `total_bullets_needed`, `t`, `distance`, `pos`, `health`, and `bullets_used`. The values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
