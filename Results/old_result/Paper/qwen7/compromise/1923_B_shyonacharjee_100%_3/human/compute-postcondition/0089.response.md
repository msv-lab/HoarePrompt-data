Output State: **`distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `can_survive` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `distance`, `total_bullets_needed`, and `can_survive`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
