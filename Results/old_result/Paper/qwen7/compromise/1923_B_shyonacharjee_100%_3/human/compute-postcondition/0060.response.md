Output State: **`can_survive` remains True, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `distance` is recalculated as `abs(next_pos)`, `pos` and `health` are updated to the next tuple in the `monsters` list, `bullets_used` is updated to `bullets_used + health + next_health, distance is calculated as abs(pos)**.

This means that the `distance` variable is now updated to the absolute value of `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states as described in the initial state.
