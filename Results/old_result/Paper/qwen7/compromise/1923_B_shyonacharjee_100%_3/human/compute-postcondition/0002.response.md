Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers `n` and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, while `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0.
