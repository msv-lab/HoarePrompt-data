Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bullets_used` equals 0, `total_bullets_needed` equals `bullets_used + health` of the last processed monster, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their first element (position), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `can_survive` is True.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `monsters` must contain at least one tuple, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `bullets_used` is increased by `health`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bullets_used` is `health` more than its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, then no changes are made to `can_survive`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bullets_used` is `2 * health` more than its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is now `2 * health + health`, `can_survive` remains unchanged, `pos` is the position of the next monster in the list, `health` is the health of the next monster in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
