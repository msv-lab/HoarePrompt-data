Output State: `can_survive` remains True, `bullets_used` equals the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list, `total_bullets_needed` equals `bullets_used + health` of the last processed monster, `t` is `t - len(monsters)`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is an empty list after all tuples have been processed, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last processed monster, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `can_survive` will still be True (assuming no break condition was met), `bullets_used` will accumulate the total health of all monsters, `total_bullets_needed` will be the sum of `bullets_used` and the health of the last monster, `t` will be reduced by the number of monsters, `monsters` will be exhausted and thus empty, `distance` will reflect the position of the last monster processed, and `x` and `a` will retain their initial states since they are not affected by the loop.
