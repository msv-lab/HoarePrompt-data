Postcondition: **`can_survive` remains True, `bullets_used` is still 0, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, and we either continue with the program flow or break out of the most internal loop or if statement based on the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`.**
