Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bullets_used` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `can_survive` is True.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bullets_used` is `health`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, the first element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `pos`, the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `health`, `can_survive` is `False`, and `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is `2 * health`, `total_bullets_needed` is `2 * health`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, the first element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `pos`, the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `health`, and `distance` is `abs(pos)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is 3 * health, `total_bullets_needed` is 3 * health, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, monsters is a list of tuples that now contains at least two tuples, and the first tuple being processed is the second tuple in the list, `distance` is abs(pos) for the new first tuple, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
