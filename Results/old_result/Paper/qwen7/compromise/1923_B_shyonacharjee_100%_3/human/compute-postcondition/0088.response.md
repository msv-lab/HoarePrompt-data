Output State: **`distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `can_survive` is False**

Explanation: The variable `can_survive` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `distance`, `total_bullets_needed`, `pos`, `bullets_used`, or `health`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions from the initial state.
