Output State: **`distance` is the absolute value of `pos`**.

The code calculates the distance as the absolute value of the position (`pos`). Since `pos` was part of the tuple in the initial state, `distance` now holds the absolute value of `pos`. The precondition that `monsters` must contain at least one tuple remains valid, and the values of `pos` and `health` from the next tuple will be used for the next iteration.
