Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `zip` object (which pairs elements from `x` and `a`) based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple. However, since `a` is not defined in the provided initial state, it is assumed that `a` is not used in the sorting process, and only `x` is considered. The sorted list is stored in the variable `monsters`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
