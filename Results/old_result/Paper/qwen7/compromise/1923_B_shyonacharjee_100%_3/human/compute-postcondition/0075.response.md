Output State: **`bullets_used` equals 0, `total_bullets_needed` equals `bullets_used + health` of the last processed monster, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their first element (position), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `bullets_used = 0` sets the value of `bullets_used` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
