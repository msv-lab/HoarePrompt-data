Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` remains unchanged, `pos` is the position of the next monster in the list, `health` is the health of the next monster in the list**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `distance` to be the absolute value of `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
