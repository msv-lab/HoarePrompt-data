### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and the logic behind the given solution to ensure its correctness.

1. **Problem Statement Recap**:
   - We need to split the array \(a\) (represented by the string \(s\)) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \(n\) of the string \(s\) and the string \(s\) itself.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters in the string \(s\) and stores it in `neg`.
   - The program then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is used to calculate the penalty.
   - This formula is derived from the observation that splitting the array into alternating segments (one positive and one negative) might minimize the penalty.
   - However, this formula does not always yield the optimal solution. For example, consider the string `+-+-+`. The optimal split would be `([+], [-], [+], [-], [+])`, resulting in a penalty of 0, but the program outputs 0 only when `n` is even and `neg` is half of `n`.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the string `+-+-+`. The optimal split is `([+], [-], [+], [-], [+])`, which results in a penalty of 0.
   - However, the program calculates `n - 2 * neg` which is `5 - 2 * 2 = 1`, which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm to find the optimal split.
   - The current implementation does not guarantee the minimum penalty for all cases.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is incorrect because the provided solution does not always yield the minimum possible penalty. The formula `n - 2 * neg` is not sufficient to handle all cases optimally.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
