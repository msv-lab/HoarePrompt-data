Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the program calculates the penalty based on the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The program's output would be:
```
4
```
However, the optimal split is `([--], [++++++], [-])`, which results in penalties of `2*2`, `7*7`, and `1*1`, respectively, summing up to `2 + 49 + 1 = 52`. The program does not consider this optimal split, leading to an incorrect result.
