Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded integer back into the lexicographically smallest word. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Decoding**: The program incorrectly assumes that the encoded value can be broken down into parts of 26 directly, which is not always the case. It fails to handle the full range of possible values correctly.
2. **Incomplete Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The logic for determining the smallest word is flawed. It doesn't ensure that the word is lexicographically smallest by considering all possible combinations.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider all possible combinations of three letters that sum up to the given encoded value and then choose the lexicographically smallest one. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_smallest_word(encoded_value):
    # Generate all possible three-letter words and check their encoded values
    min_word = "zzz"
    for i in range(1, 27):
        for j in range(1, 27):
            for k in range(1, 27):
                if i + j + k == encoded_value:
                    current_word = chr(i + 96) + chr(j + 96) + chr(k + 96)
                    if current_word < min_word:
                        min_word = current_word
    return min_word

def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        print(find_smallest_word(lex))

func()
```

This program iterates through all possible combinations of three letters (from 'a' to 'z') and checks if their sum matches the given encoded value. It keeps track of the lexicographically smallest word found during this process.
