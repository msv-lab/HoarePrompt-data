Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a' three times.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `k` will be set to 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to 2, inclusive). The list `arr` remains unchanged as [1, 13, 26] because the loop body does not modify it. The loop prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` plus 96, which results in 'a', 'm', and 'z' being printed in the first iteration. However, based on the final state described, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or simplification in the problem statement, as the final output should be 'a' three times if we follow the logic strictly. Therefore, the loop prints 'a' three times after all iterations are completed.
