Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `k` and `range(3)`. The variable `k` is the loop index, and `range(3)` means the loop will iterate 3 times, starting from `k = 0` to `k = 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `k`**: Since the loop starts with `k = 0` and iterates up to `k = 2`, the initial state of `k` should be set to `0`.

3. **Check the Range Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `k < 3`. This condition is always true for `k = 0, 1, 2`, so no additional adjustments are needed for this condition.

4. **Adjust the Other Variables**: The other variables (`j`, `lex`, and `arr`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial state of `k`.

**State: **`k` is 0**
