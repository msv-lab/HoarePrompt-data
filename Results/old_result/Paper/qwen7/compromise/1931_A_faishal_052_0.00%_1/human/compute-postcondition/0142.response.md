Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, 26]**.

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 26` subtracts 26 from the current value of `lex`. Since `lex` was initially adjusted based on its initial value (either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26` or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`), the adjustment remains unchanged. The value of `j` and the list `arr` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `j` is still 2, `lex` is now `lex - 26`, and `arr` remains as [26, 26, 26].
