Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `1` (inclusive) because `range(2)` generates values from `0` to `1`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value (either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26` or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`).
   - `arr` contains the elements `[26, 26]`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `j in range(2)`, which means the loop will run for `j = 0` and `j = 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**: Since `j` is currently 2, it exceeds the range `0` to `1`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjusting States**: We need to ensure that the loop does not execute again. This means `j` should not be within the range `0` to `1`.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is outside the range `0` to `1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value (either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26` or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`), and `arr` contains the elements [26, 26]**. However, for the loop to not execute again, `j` must be outside the range `0` to `1`.

Since `j` is already 2, it is outside the range `0` to `1`, so no change is needed for `j`.

**Answer**:
State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value (either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26` or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`), and `arr` contains the elements [26, 26]**.
