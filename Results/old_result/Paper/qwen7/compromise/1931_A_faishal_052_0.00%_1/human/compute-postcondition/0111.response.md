Output State: **`k` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `cases` is 3**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `lex`. Since the input value is not specified, `lex` is updated to the integer value entered by the user. All other variables (`k`, `arr`, `i`, `cases`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
