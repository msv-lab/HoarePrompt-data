Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will run twice.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lex` is an integer.
   - `arr` is a list.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the value 1.
   - If `lex` is between 26 and 52, `arr` contains the elements [1, 26].
   - If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the elements [1, 26].

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to 1, the loop will execute twice.
   - After the first iteration (`j = 0`), the state remains as described above.
   - For the second iteration (`j = 1`), the state should reflect the changes if any were made within the loop body. However, since no specific loop body is provided, we assume no changes are made to `lex` or `arr` inside the loop body.

5. **Final state before the next iteration**:
   - `lex` remains an integer.
   - `arr` remains a list.
   - Depending on the value of `lex`, `arr` either contains 1, [1, 26], or remains [1, 26] as described.

Given that no changes are made to `lex` or `arr` within the loop body, the state remains the same as the postcondition described.

**State: **`lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the value 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 52, `arr` contains the elements [1, 26]. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the elements [1, 26].**
