Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(2)`. This means `j` will take values from 0 to 1.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 2
   - `arr` is a list
   - `lex` is adjusted according to the condition
   - `j` is 1

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` is currently 1 and the range is `range(2)`, the next value of `j` will be 2.

4. **Adjust the state based on the next value of `j`**:
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `lex` remains adjusted as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` will be updated to 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `j` being 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list, `lex` is adjusted according to the condition, `j` is 2**
