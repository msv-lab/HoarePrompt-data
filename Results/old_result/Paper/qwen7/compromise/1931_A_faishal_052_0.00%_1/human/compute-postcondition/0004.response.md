Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the variable being iterated over using `range(2)`. This means `j` will take on the values 0 and 1 during the iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since `j` is being initialized within the loop head itself (specifically, `for j in range(2):`), its initial value is not specified in the given state. However, we know that `j` will start from the first value in the range, which is 0.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. Given that `j` starts at 0 and increments by default in a `for` loop with `range`, the loop will execute twice (when `j` is 0 and then when `j` is 1).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute. Since `j` is being initialized and incremented within the loop, the only state that needs adjustment is `j` itself. It should start at 0 and be incremented by the loop mechanism.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should start at 0.
- `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `lex` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the final state is:

**`j` is 0, `cases` is a positive integer such that 1 <= cases <= 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer**.

However, since `j` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop, the most concise answer would be:

**`j` is 0**.
