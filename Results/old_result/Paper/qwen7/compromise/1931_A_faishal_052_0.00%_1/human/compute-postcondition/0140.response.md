Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 1`, and `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, 1]**.

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 1` decreases the value of `lex` by 1. Since the initial state of `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value (either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26` or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`), the new value of `lex` is `lex - 1`. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
