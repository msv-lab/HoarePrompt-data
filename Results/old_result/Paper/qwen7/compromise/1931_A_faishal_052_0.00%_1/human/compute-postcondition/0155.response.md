Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `chr` function is `arr[k] + 96`.
   - Since `k` is 1, we need to know the value of `arr[1]` to proceed.
   - However, the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `arr[1]`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact character that will be printed without additional information about `arr`.

Given the lack of information about `arr[1]`, we can only describe the output in terms of the formula used.

Output: **the character corresponding to arr[1] + 96 (where arr[1] is the second element of the list arr)**
