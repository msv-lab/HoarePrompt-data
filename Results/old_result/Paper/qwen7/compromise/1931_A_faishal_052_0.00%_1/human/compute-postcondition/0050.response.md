Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list containing the elements `[1, 13, 26]`.
   - `k` is the integer `2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution:**
   - First, we need to evaluate `arr[k]`. Since `k` is `2`, we look at the third element of the list `arr`.
     - The third element of `arr` is `26`.
   - Next, we add `96` to this value: `26 + 96 = 122`.
   - We then convert this integer to its corresponding character using the `chr()` function. The integer `122` corresponds to the character `'v'` in ASCII.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the character `'v'`.

Output: **v**
