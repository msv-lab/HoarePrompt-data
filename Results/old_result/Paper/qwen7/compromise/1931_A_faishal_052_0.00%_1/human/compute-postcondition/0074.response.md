Postcondition: `k` is 2, `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1]. Otherwise, `arr` contains either [26] if `lex` is greater than 10 and less than 26, or [26, (lex - 26)] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 26. `lex` is adjusted accordingly, and `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.
