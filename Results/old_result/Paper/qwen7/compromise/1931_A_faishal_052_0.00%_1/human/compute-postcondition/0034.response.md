Output State: **`lex` is an integer and `arr` contains the elements [1, 26, 26]**.

Explanation: The initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`. However, regardless of the initial value of `arr`, the code appends the value 26 to `arr`. Therefore, if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` initially contains the value 1, and after appending 26, it becomes [1, 26, 26]. If `lex` is between 26 and 52, `arr` initially contains [1, 26], and after appending 26, it becomes [1, 26, 26]. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` initially contains [1, 26], and after appending 26, it also becomes [1, 26, 26]. In all cases, the final state of `arr` is [1, 26, 26].
