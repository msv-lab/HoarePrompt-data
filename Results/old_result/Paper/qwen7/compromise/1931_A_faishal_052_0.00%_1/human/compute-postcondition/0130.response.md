Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value, `arr` contains the elements [26, 26]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained the element `26`. After appending `26` again, `arr` now contains `[26, 26]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
