Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a' three times for each of the `cases` iterations.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `k` will be set to 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to 2, inclusive). The list `arr` remains unchanged as [1, 13, 26] because the loop body does not modify it. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` plus 96, which results in 'a', 'm', and 'z' being printed in sequence. However, since the question specifies that the output is 'a' three times, it implies that the values in `arr` are all 1 after the loop completes, leading to 'a' being printed three times for each case.
