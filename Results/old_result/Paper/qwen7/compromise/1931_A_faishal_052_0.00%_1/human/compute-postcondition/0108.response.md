Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(cases)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `k` is 3
   - `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0
   - `lex` is 0

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = cases - 1`. This means the loop will execute `cases` times in total. After all iterations, the value of `i` (which is equivalent to `k` in this context) will be `cases`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: Since the loop is about to start its first iteration, we need to set the initial values for `i` and `cases` such that the loop can execute. Given that `k` is currently 3, and the loop runs from `k=0` to `k=2`, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 0 and `cases` is set to 3.

5. **Update the State**: The state of `arr` and `lex` remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify them.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `k` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0, `lex` is 0**
