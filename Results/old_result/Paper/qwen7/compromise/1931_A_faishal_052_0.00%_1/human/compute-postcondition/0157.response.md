Given the initial state where `k` is 2, let's break down the code snippet:

1. The variable `k` is explicitly given as 2.
2. The code snippet refers to `arr[k]`, which means it accesses the element at index 2 of the list `arr`.
3. We need to add 96 to the value of `arr[k]` and then convert it to a character using the `chr()` function.
4. Since the value of `arr[k]` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact character that will be printed. However, we can describe the process.

Let's assume `arr` is a list with at least three elements. For example, if `arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', ...]`, then `arr[2]` would be 'c'. Adding 96 to 'c' (which is represented as its ASCII value, 99) would give us 195. The `chr(195)` would then return the character corresponding to the ASCII value 195.

Since the exact value of `arr[2]` is not provided, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **the character corresponding to the ASCII value of arr[2] + 96**
