The function interacts with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) and determines the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. It does this by making up to \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results. After completing the loop, the function outputs the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize the bitwise XOR operation.
