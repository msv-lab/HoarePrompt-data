Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: A lambda function `R` is defined that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. No variables are assigned any values, and the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
        elif r == '=':
            print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r2 = input('')
            if r2 == '<':
                prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `i` being equal to `n-1`. The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. The variable `prev` is set to `n-1` if any input resulted in `r` or `r2` being `'> '` or `'<'` respectively during the loop's execution. Otherwise, `prev` retains its previous value. `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `r` is the input value from the last iteration, and `prev` is `n-1`. `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is n, n must be greater than or equal to 3, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, prev is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
