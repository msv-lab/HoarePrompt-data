Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `r` is the input from the user, `v2` is `i`**.

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` updates the value of `v2` to be equal to the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `r`, and the relationship of `v2` to `i` are updated as described.
