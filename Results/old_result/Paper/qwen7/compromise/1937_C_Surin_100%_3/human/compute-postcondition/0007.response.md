Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`.**

The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, `v2` is simply assigned the value of `i`. All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, and `v1`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
