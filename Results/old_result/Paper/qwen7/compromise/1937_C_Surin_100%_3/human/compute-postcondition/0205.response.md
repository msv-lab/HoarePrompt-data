Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `n-1`**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is related to how the output is handled rather than changing any variable values. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
