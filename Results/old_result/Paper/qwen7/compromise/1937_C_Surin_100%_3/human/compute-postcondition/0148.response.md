Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is the input value from the user, `prev` is 2, `r2` is the input value from the user**.

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `prev`. The values of `n`, `r`, and `r2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
