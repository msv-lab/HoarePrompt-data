Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is an input string**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of the input string provided by the user. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid. The value of `r` is updated to the input string, which could be any string except '>' if it was previously an input string not equal to '>', or it could be '=' in which case `r2` is '<' and `prev` is 1, but these conditions are no longer directly relevant since `r` has been updated.
