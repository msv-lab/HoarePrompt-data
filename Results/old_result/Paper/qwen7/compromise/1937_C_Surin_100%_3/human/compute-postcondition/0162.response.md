Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `r2` is an input string**

Explanation: The variable `r2` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is expected to be a string. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `n` (it must be greater than 3) also remains valid.
