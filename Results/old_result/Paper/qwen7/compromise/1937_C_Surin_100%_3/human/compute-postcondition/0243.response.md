Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but its specific value is not needed for the print statement.
- `r` is an input string, but its value is not specified and thus not needed for the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Here, `prev` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined what its value is. Since `prev` is not defined, it will be treated as a variable name rather than a specific value.

Output: **'? 3 3 prev prev'**
