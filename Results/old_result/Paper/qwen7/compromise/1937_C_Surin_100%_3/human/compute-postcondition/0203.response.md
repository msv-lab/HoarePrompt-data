Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than `n-1`.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `prev` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). This means the loop will start when `i` is 1 and continue until `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n`, and the loop requires `i` to be in the range from 1 to `n-1`, `i` must be adjusted to start at 1.
   - `n` should remain as it is because the loop condition depends on `n` being greater than `i`, and `n` itself is not changing within the loop.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `v2`, `v1`, and `prev` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` needs to be set to 1, and `n` must remain as an input integer greater than `n-1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `n-1`**
