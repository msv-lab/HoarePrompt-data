Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `n` is a new input integer which is greater than `n-1`
- `v2` is 3
- `v1` is 2

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, the placeholders `{v1}` and `{v2}` will be replaced with the values of `v1` and `v2` respectively. 

- `v1` is explicitly given as 2.
- `v2` is explicitly given as 3.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'? 2 2 3 3'`.

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
