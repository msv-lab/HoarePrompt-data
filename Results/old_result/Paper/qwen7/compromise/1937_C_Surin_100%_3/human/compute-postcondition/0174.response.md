Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the input value from the last iteration, `r` is the input value from the last iteration, `prev` is `n-1`, and `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input and assigns it to `n`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 initially, the new value of `n` will also satisfy this condition. The values of `i`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their previous states.
