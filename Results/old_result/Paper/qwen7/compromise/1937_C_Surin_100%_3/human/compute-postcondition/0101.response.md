Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `r` is equal to '<', `v2` is `i`**.

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` updates the value of `v2` to be equal to `i`. Initially, `v2` was equal to `i + 1`. After executing the code, `v2` now equals `i`. All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
