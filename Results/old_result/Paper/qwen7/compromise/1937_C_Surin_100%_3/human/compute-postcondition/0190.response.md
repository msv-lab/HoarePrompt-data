Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 2) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `n` is described as "the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`", it implies that `n` was previously an integer and now it remains the same as before the assignment.
