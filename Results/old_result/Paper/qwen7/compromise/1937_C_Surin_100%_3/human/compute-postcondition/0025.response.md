Output State: **`kp` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `i`, and the character `r` is unchanged, being less than or equal to '<'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given that `i` is initially `n - 1`, `v2` is updated to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
