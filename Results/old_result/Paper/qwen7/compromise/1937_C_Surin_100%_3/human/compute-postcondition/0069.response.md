Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `r` is an input string.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, if the loop was just completed, `i` would have been incremented from 1 to 2 (if it started at 1).

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 to allow another iteration.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2.

7. **Consider the variable `r`**:
   - The value of `r` does not affect the loop condition directly, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, and `r` is an input string**.
