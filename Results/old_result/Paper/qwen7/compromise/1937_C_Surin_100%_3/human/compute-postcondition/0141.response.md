Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (though the value of `n` itself is not needed for the print statement).
   - `r` is either '>' or '='.
   - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1.
   - If `r` is '=', and the current value of `r2` is '<', then `prev` is set to 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.

Given the conditions:
- Since `i` is explicitly stated as 2, we know `i = 2`.
- The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r`:
  - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1.
  - If `r` is '=', and `r2` is '<', then `prev` is 1.
  - If neither of these conditions is met, the value of `prev` is not specified, but based on the given conditions, it would default to 1 in both cases mentioned.

Therefore, regardless of the actual value of `r`, `prev` will be 1.

Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, it cannot be determined from the given information. However, the format of the print statement suggests that `v1` is a placeholder that should be replaced with some value, but since no specific value is provided, we will leave it as `v1`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
Output: **? v1 2 v1 1**
