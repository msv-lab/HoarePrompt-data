Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is directly provided as 3. However, `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state, so they cannot be determined from the given information. Since no explicit values are provided for `v1` and `prev`, we need to acknowledge this in our answer.

Given the lack of specific values for `v1` and `prev`, the output will include placeholders for these undefined variables.

Output: **'? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev]'**
