Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `kp` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is `i`
   - `r` is the input from the user
   - `v2` is `i`

4. **Check the loop termination condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1, if `i` is currently less than `n`, the loop will continue.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `v1` and `r` was the input from the user.
   - If `r` is not equal to '<', `v1` will be incremented by 1, making `v1` equal to `i + 1`.
   - If `r` is equal to '<', `v1` remains unchanged as `i`.

6. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `kp` remains 0.
   - `g` remains 0.
   - `v1` will be `i + 1` if `r` is not '<', otherwise it remains `i`.
   - `r` remains the same as the input from the user.
   - `v2` will be `i + 1` if `r` is not '<', otherwise it remains `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `r` is the input from the user, `v2` is `i + 1`**.
