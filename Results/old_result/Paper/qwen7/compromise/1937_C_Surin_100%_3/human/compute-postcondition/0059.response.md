Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is mentioned to be greater than 2 but no specific value is provided, so we don't need to use it in the print statement.
- `r` is an input string but its value is not specified, so we will keep it as `prev` in the print statement since `prev` is used in the template.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Given the values:
- `{i}` will be replaced by the value of `i`, which is 2.
- `{prev}` will be replaced by the value of `prev`, which is `r`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 2 2 r r**
