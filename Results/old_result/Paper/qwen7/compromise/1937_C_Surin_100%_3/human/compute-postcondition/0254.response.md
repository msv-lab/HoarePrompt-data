Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is a value greater than or equal to 3.
- `v2` is `n - 1`.
- `v1` is also `n - 1`.
- `prev` is 3.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `prev` is explicitly given as 3.
- `v1` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 3, `v1` will be `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **! 3 [n-1]**
