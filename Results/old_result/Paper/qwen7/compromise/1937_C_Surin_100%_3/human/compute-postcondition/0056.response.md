Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is either an input string not equal to '>', or `r` is '=' in which case `r2` is '<' and `prev` is 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are updated or affected by this operation, the initial state remains unchanged.
