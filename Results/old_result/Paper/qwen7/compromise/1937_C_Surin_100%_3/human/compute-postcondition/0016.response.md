Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `kp` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `n` must be at least 2 (relevant to the loop head)
   - `g` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `v1` is `i` (relevant to the loop head)
   - `v2` is `i` (relevant to the loop head)
   - `r` is the input string from the user and its current value is equal to '<' (not relevant to the loop head)
4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be the last value it was set to, which is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Adjusted States**:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will become `n` for the next iteration.
- `n` remains the same since the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`kp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string from the user and its current value is equal to '<'**
