Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is the input value from the user, `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 1 if `r` is '<', `r2` is the input value from the user.**

The code `r2 = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
