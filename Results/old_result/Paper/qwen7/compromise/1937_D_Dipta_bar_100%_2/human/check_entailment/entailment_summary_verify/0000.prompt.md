You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It calculates and prints a series of values based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. These values are derived from cumulative sums of positions of '>' and '<' characters, adjusted by their respective indices. If the counts of '<' and '>' characters are not equal, the function prints the difference; otherwise, it prints 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for certain configurations. Specifically, consider the input `"<>"`. According to the problem description, the pinball starts at index 0, moves right to index 1, and then moves left to leave the grid after 2 seconds. However, the program incorrectly calculates this as taking 4 seconds.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. For the input `"<>"`:
   - Initially, the pinball is at index 0 and moves right to index 1.
   - The character at index 1 is `>`, so it moves left back to index 0.
   - The character at index 0 is `<`, so it moves right to leave the grid after 2 seconds.

The program, however, calculates this as taking 4 seconds, which is incorrect. This discrepancy indicates that the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly handle the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.

Thus, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
