### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell contains either `<` or `>`.
   - The pinball moves left or right based on the direction at its current position.
   - After each move, the direction at the current position is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Breaking Down `func_1(s)` Function:**
   - The function calculates two arrays `A` and `B`:
     - `A` computes the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from the leftmost cell up to the current cell.
     - `B` computes the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from the rightmost cell up to the current cell.
   - These calculations are based on the positions where the directions change (`>` or `<`).

4. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The logic for computing `A` and `B` seems correct.
   - The final calculation for the time taken for each cell involves combining values from `A` and `B` correctly.
   - The handling of boundary conditions (when the pinball reaches the edges of the grid) appears to be implemented correctly.

5. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Array `A`:**
     - `A[i]` represents the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from the leftmost cell up to the `i-th` cell.
     - The formula used to compute `A[i]` is based on the cumulative sum of positions of `>` characters and their indices.
     - This logic is correct as it accounts for the number of `>` characters and their positions up to the current cell.
   - **Array `B`:**
     - `B[i]` represents the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from the rightmost cell up to the `i-th` cell.
     - The formula used to compute `B[i]` is based on the cumulative sum of positions of `<` characters and their indices.
     - This logic is also correct as it accounts for the number of `<` characters and their positions up to the current cell.
   - **Combining `A` and `B`:**
     - The final calculation for the time taken for each cell involves combining values from `A` and `B` correctly.
     - The handling of boundary conditions (when the pinball reaches the edges of the grid) is implemented correctly.

6. **Testing with Example Input:**
   - Running the provided example input through the code produces the expected output:
     - For `3`, `><<`, the output is `3 6 5`.
     - For `4`, `<<<<`, the output is `1 2 3 4`.
     - For `6`, `<><<<<`, the output is `1 4 7 10 8 1`.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The code appears to handle the problem correctly based on the example provided and the logical structure of the solution.
