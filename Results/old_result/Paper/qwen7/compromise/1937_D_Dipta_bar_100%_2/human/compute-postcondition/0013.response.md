Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `r` is equal to the length of list `B`.
   - `l`, `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be set to 0 (the starting point of the range function), and `n` should be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be set to 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - `n` should be a positive integer to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
