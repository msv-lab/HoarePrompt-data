Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n)`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 (as specified by `range(0, n)`).
   - The variable `n` should be a positive integer so that the loop can execute at least once.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - The state before the loop starts is given as: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list.
   - We need to focus on adjusting the states of `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
