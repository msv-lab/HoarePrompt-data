Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of the string `s**.

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The string `s` remains unchanged, and its length is now stored in `n`.
