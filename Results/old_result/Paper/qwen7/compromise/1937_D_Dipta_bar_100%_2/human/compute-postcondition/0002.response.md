Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `idx_A = []` initializes `idx_A` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `s` or `A`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` being an empty list, and `idx_A` also being an empty list.
