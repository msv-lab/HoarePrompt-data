Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a certain number of stones from all non-empty piles simultaneously. The player who cannot make a move loses. The solution uses dynamic programming to determine the winner based on the parity of the XOR of the sizes of the piles after processing them through `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` processes the list `a` by sorting it and then computing a new list `a_new` where each element (starting from the second) is reduced by the corresponding element in the sorted list up to the previous index.
   - This transformation is aimed at simplifying the game state into a form where the XOR of the elements can be used to determine the winner.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2` determines the winner based on the transformed list `a_new` using a recursive approach.
   - For `n == 1`, the player who starts loses.
   - For `n == 2`, the player who starts wins if the first pile has an odd number of stones, otherwise loses.
   - For `n > 2`, the function checks if the opponent can force a win in the next turn. If the opponent can force a win or if the current player can't force a win and the first pile isn't a single stone, the current player wins; otherwise, the opponent wins.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads input, calls `func_1` to transform the list, and then calls `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The logic seems to correctly implement the strategy for determining the winner based on the transformed list and the recursive function.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided example outputs match the expected results.
   - The transformations and recursive checks in `func_1` and `func_2` respectively seem to correctly handle the game logic and determine the winner based on optimal play.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
