Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l <= r`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `sunks` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)
3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l <= r` must be true.
   - Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is an integer, `r` will always be at least 0 (assuming `n` is a positive integer).
   - Therefore, the condition `l <= r` is already satisfied with the current values of `l` and `r`.

Since the loop condition is already met with the given values, no adjustments are necessary.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` is 0, `r` is n - 1**
