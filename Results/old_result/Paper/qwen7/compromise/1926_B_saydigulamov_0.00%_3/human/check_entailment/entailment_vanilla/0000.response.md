Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of the grid.
   - Then, it reads `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1').

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `k` to store the count of '1's in each row.
   - For each row, it counts the number of '1's and appends this count to `k`.

3. **Checking for Square or Triangle:**
   - The program checks if the first element in `k` is equal to the second element (`k[0] == k[1]`).
   - If they are equal, it prints `k`, which is not meaningful according to the problem statement.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Shape:**
   - The program only checks the first two elements of `k` to determine if the shape is a square. This logic is insufficient because:
     - For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's.
     - For a triangle, the counts of '1's in rows should follow a specific pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...).

2. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE". This does not meet the requirement of the problem.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle, we need to:
- Check if all rows have the same number of '1's (indicating a square).
- Check if the counts of '1's in rows follow the pattern of a triangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        k = []
        for _ in range(n):
            b = input().strip()
            k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        # Check for square
        if len(set(k)) == 1 and k[0] >= 2:
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            # Check for triangle
            if k[0] == 1 and all(k[i+1] == k[i] + 2 for i in range(len(k)-1)):
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                print("TRIANGLE")  # Default to triangle if neither condition matches

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not properly check for the shape and outputs the wrong information. Therefore, the given program is **Incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
