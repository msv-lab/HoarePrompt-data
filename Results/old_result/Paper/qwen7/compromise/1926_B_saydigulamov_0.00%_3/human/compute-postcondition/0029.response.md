Output State: **`b` is an input string from the user, and the string `b` contains the character '1'; `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`, which is 1.**

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `b`. Since the initial state mentions that `b` contains the character '1', the count of '1' in `b` is 1. The value `1` is then appended to the list `k`. Therefore, `k` now contains the count of '1' in `b`, which is 1.
