Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, `b` is the input string from `int(input())` converted to a string.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user using `input()`. Since the input to `int(input())` must result in a positive integer, `b` will be a string representation of that positive integer. The other variables (`a`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
