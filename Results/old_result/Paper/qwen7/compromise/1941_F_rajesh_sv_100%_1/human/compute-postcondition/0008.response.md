Output State: `testcases` must be greater than 3.

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `testcases` must be greater than 3. This is because the loop runs `testcases` times, and we know it has run at least 3 times. Therefore, `testcases` had to be at least 3 initially and must remain greater than 3 after all iterations.
