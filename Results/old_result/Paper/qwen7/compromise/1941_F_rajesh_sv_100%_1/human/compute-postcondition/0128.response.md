Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` must be strictly greater than `l`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`. It also does not change the relationship between `l`, `h`, and `mid`. The only change is that `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `mid` being updated according to the given formula.
