Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found across all pairs of adjacent elements in the list `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is `n`, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]` if `max_diff` was updated during the last iteration or does not exist otherwise, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max_diff` assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
