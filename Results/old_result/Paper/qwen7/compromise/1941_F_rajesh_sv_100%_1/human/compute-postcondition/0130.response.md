Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `h = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to `h`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `h` now equals `mid`, while `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and the expression for updating `mid` remain as they were initially.
