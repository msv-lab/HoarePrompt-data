Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while l < h`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `l` and `h`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`
   - `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`
   - `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`
   - `h` is either greater than `l` or equal to `mid`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `h`.
   - Given the current state, `l` is either `mid + 1` or `mid`, and `h` is either greater than `l` or equal to `mid`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure `l < h`, we need to make sure that `l` is not equal to `h`.
   - Since `l` can be either `mid + 1` or `mid`, and `h` can be either greater than `l` or equal to `mid`, the only way to guarantee `l < h` is to ensure that `h` is strictly greater than `l`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `h` is strictly greater than `l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` is strictly greater than `l`**
