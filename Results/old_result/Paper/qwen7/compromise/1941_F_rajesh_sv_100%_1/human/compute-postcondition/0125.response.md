Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` is strictly greater than `l`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.**
