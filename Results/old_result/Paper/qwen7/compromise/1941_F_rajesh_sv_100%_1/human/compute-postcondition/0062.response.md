Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`, and `l` remains the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]` and must be less than `h`.**
