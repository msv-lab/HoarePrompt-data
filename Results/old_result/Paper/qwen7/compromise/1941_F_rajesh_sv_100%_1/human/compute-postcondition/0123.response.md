Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` is strictly greater than `l`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is now equal to `mid`**.

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `mid`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions. Therefore, `h` is now equal to `mid`, while `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and the condition that `h` is strictly greater than `l` remain unchanged.
