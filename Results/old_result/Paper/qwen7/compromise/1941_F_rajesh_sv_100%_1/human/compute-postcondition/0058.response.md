Output State: **`mid` is `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` must be less than `h`.**

This means that the variable `mid` is calculated as the midpoint between `l` and `h`. The values of `h` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and the condition that `l` must be less than `h` still holds true.
