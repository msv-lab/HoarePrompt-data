Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `-inf`, `index` is `None`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        next_max_diff = max_diff
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 3, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` are updated accordingly, and `index` is set to 3. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, but `max_diff` and `index` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 5. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `max_diff`, and `index` is set to 5. Otherwise, if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 7. If `A[6] - A[5]` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[6] - A[5]` and `index` is set to 7. Otherwise, if `A[6] - A[5]` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[6] - A[5]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
