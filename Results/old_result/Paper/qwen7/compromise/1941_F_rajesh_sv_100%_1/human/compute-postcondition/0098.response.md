Output State: **`mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` remains unchanged, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `h` remains unchanged, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `D` remains unchanged, and `l < h` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `ans`, `h`, `mid`, `left`, `right`, `f`, and `D`) remain unchanged. The condition `l < h` must still hold true.
