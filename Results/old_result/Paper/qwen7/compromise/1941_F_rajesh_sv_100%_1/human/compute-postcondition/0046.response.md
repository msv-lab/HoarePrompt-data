To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states:

- The loop condition is `l < h`.
- We need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` for the loop to execute.

Given states:
- `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`.

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `h`. Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **Initial Values of `h` and `l`:**
   - `h` is determined by the condition `D[h] < right - f`.
   - `l` is determined by the condition `D[l] > left - F[0]`.

2. **Ensuring `l < h`:**
   - If `l` is already less than `h`, no adjustment is needed.
   - If `l` is not less than `h`, we need to adjust either `l` or `h` to satisfy the condition `l < h`.

Since we cannot directly control the values of `D[h]` and `D[l]` (as they depend on the array `D`), we can only adjust the indices `h` and `l` themselves to ensure the condition `l < h` is met.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` by adjusting the states of `l` and `h`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, and `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` must be less than `h`**.
