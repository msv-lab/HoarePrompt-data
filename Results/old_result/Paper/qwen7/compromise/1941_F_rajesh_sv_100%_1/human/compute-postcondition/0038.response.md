Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 7. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `index` is updated to 7, and `next_max_diff` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[6] - A[5]` if `A[6] - A[5]` is greater than `next_max_diff`, otherwise `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.
