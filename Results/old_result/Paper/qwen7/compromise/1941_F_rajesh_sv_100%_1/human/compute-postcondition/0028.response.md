Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 5. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `max_diff`, and `index` is set to 5. Otherwise, if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.
