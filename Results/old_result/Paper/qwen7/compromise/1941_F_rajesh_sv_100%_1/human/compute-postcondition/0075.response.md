Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `f` in the range specified by `F`. Therefore, the only variable that changes within this loop is `f`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body updates the variable `ans` based on the expression `min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))`. However, the variables `l` and `h` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated based on the current value of `f`.
   - `l` and `h` remain unchanged.
   - `f` will take the next value in the range `F` in the next iteration.

Given that `f` is the only variable that changes within the loop, and it will take the next value in the range `F`, the state at the start of the next iteration will be determined by the next value of `f`.

Since the exact values of `ans`, `l`, and `h` are not provided, we can only say that `f` will be the next value in the range `F`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f) with the next value of `f`, while `l` and `h` remain unchanged.**
