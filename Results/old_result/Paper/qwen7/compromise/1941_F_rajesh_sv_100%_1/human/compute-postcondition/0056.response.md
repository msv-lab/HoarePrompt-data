Postcondition: `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` must be less than `h`; `mid` is recalculated based on the condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)`. If the condition is true, `mid` becomes `mid + 1`, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `h` remains `mid`, and `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, with `mid` recalculated as usual.
