You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

    #The program returns a wrapper object.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a callable object `func` and returns a wrapper object.

    return d[args]
    #The program returns the value of `func(*args)` stored in dictionary `d` under key `args`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function uses the arguments passed through `*args` to look up a value in dictionary `d`. If the key `args` exists in `d`, it returns the corresponding value. If the key does not exist, it calls `func(*args)`, stores the result in `d` under the key `args`, and then returns this stored value.

However, it will be an integer within the range as described by the initial state constraints.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any direct parameters. Instead, it relies on predefined variables and lists (t, n, m, k, a, d, f) with specific constraints. After executing, it returns an integer value calculated by calling another function `func_2()`. This returned integer will fall within the range defined by the initial state constraints.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes three lists: A (a list of n strictly increasing integers), D (a sorted list of m unique integers), and F (a list of k integers representing complexities).

    #
    #In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `testcases` must be greater than 3. This is because the loop runs `testcases` times, and we know it has run at least 3 times. Therefore, `testcases` had to be at least 3 initially and must remain greater than 3 after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving lists and integers. It initializes the number of test cases and ensures that this number is greater than 3 after processing all test cases. The function does not return any value directly but modifies internal states based on the given inputs.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1` and `wrapper` are defined but not used in the main logic. These functions seem to be placeholders or part of some external code that isn't relevant to solving the problem.
   - `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7` are helper functions that read input from stdin. They are correctly implemented for reading integers and lines from standard input.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is encapsulated in `func_7`. This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of prepared problems (`n`), the number of models (`m`), and the number of functions (`k`).
   - It then reads the complexities of the prepared problems (`A`), the complexities of the models (`D`), and the complexities of the functions (`F`).
   - The function calculates the current maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the next maximum difference (`next_max_diff`) in the sequence of prepared problems.
   - It iterates through the functions and checks how adding a new problem (created by combining a model and a function) can reduce the imbalance.
   - Specifically, it uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find the optimal positions for the new problem and updates the answer accordingly.

### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The input reading functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) are correctly implemented and should work as expected.

2. **Finding Maximum Differences**:
   - The logic for finding `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` is correct. It correctly identifies the largest gap between consecutive elements in the list of prepared problems.

3. **Combining Models and Functions**:
   - The logic for combining models and functions to create new problems is correct. It uses binary search to efficiently find the best position for the new problem.

4. **Updating the Answer**:
   - The logic for updating the answer (`ans`) by considering the new problem created from each combination of model and function is correct. It ensures that the minimum possible imbalance is found.

### Conclusion:

Given that the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the input and output as specified, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
