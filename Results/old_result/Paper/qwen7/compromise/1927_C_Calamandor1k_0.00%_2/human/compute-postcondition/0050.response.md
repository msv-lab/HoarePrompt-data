Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from further splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`**.

The code calculates the lengths of lists `a` and `b` and assigns them to `len_a` and `len_b` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
