Output State: **`i` is equal to the maximum value between `len_a` and `len_b`, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`.**

The code initializes `count_a` and `count_b` to 0. It does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, or `len_b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values.
