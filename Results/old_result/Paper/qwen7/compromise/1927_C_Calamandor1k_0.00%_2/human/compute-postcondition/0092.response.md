Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to the maximum value between `len_a` and `len_b`, `count_a` is incremented by 1 for every index `i` where `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than the length of `a`, `count_b` is incremented by 1 for every index `i` where `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than the length of `b`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to the maximum length between lists `a` and `b`. The variable `count_a` will hold the total number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, up to the length of `a`. Similarly, `count_b` will hold the total number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, up to the length of `b`.
