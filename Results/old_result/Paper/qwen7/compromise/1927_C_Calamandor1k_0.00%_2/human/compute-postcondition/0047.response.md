Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `t` was initially set to 4 and remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with the unchanged value of `t`.
