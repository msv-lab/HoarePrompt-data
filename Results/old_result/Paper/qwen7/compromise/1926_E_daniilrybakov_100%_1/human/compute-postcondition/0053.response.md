Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is the input integer, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is increased by `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding `x` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
