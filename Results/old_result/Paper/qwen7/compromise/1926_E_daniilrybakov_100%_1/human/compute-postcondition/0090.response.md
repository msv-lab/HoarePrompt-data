Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is (`n + 1`) // 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n` and `x`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `n` and `x` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
