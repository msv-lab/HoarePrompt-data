Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is now `n // 2` raised to the power of the number of iterations the loop executed, `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2\) raised to the power of the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), and `s` is the sum of `x` added for each iteration the loop executed.

To explain further, let's denote the number of iterations as `i`. After `i` iterations, the value of `n` will be the original `n` divided by \(2^i\). The variable `m` will be \(2^i\) because it gets multiplied by 2 in each iteration. The value of `x` will be \((n + 1) // 2\) after the last iteration. The variable `s` will be the sum of `x` for each iteration, which is essentially the sum of terms where each term is \((n // 2^j + 1) // 2\) for \(j\) from 0 to \(i-1\).
