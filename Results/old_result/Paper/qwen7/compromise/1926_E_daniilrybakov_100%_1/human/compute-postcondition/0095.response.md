Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is now `n // 2` raised to the power of the number of times the loop executed, `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2\) raised to the power of the number of times the loop executed, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), and `s` is the sum of `x` added in each iteration of the loop.

To understand this, let's break it down:

- The variable `n` is halved in each iteration of the loop, so after `i` iterations, `n` becomes `n // 2^i`.
- The variable `m` doubles with each iteration, so after `i` iterations, `m` becomes \(2^i\).
- The variable `x` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2\) at the start of each iteration, where `n` is halved from its previous value.
- The variable `s` accumulates the value of `x` in each iteration until the condition `s < k and k <= s + x` is met, at which point the loop breaks. After all iterations, `s` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop.

Since the exact number of iterations is not specified but implied by the problem setup, the final state will depend on how many times the loop runs, which is determined by the initial value of `n`. However, the general form of the output state can be described as above.
