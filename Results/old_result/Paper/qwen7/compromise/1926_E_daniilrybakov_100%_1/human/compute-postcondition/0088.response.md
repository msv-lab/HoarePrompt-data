Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `x`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, `x` will be the integer division of `(n + 1)` by 2. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains valid, and the value of `x` is updated based on the value of `n`.
