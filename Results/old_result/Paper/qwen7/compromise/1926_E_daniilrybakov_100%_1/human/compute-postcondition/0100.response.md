Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and given integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function processes these values but does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases, each containing values for t, n, and k, and performs some operation based on these values, though the specific operation is not detailed here.
