Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is a non-zero input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `s` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to \((n + 1) // 2\), which means `x` is the integer division of \(n + 1\) by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
