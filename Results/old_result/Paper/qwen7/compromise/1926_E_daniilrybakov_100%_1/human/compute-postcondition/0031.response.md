Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations (which is 3 in this case), `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration, `m` is 8 (since it doubles every iteration and we iterate 3 times), `x` is (n + 1) // 2 for the final iteration, and `s` is increased by `x`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 50,000, `n` is reduced to `n` // 2 three times (i.e., `n` // 8), `k` remains as the input integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from each iteration, `m` is 8 (as it doubles every iteration), `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` for the last iteration, and `s` is incremented by this final `x` value.
