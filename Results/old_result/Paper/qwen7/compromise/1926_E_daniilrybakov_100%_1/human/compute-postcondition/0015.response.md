Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
