Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is halved from its current value and is now an integer obtained by dividing the original `n` by 2, `k` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 8, and `x` for the next iteration is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.

The code initializes `s` to 0. This means that the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
