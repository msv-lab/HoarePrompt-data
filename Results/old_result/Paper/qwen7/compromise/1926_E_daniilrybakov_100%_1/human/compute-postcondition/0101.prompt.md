You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        m = 1
        
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is now `n // 2` raised to the power of the total number of iterations the loop executed, `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2\) raised to the power of the total number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\) for the final iteration, and `s` is the sum of `x` values from each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 50,000, `n` is reduced to `n` // \(2^t\)` (where \(t\) is the total number of iterations), `k` remains as the input integer, `m` is \(2^t\) (as `m` doubles every iteration), `x` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2\) for the last iteration, and `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and given integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function processes these values but does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
