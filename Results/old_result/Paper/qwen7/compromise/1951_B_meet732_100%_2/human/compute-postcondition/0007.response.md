Output State: **The program returns a value that is 1 less than the value of c, where c is either 2 or less than 2 depending on whether the condition c == 2 was met during the loop.**

This means if `c` is 2, the program returns 1. If `c` is less than 2, the program returns a value that is 1 less than `c`.
