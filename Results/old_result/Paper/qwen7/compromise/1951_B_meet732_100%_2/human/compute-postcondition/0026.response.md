Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing indices of at most two elements from the list `a` where the corresponding cow ratings are greater than the k-th element of list `a`, and `c` is either 2 or less than 2 depending on whether the condition `c == 2` was met during the loop, and `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not 1, and `ind[0] != 0`.
