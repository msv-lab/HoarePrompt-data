Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `x`, where `t` is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `x` is between 2 and 1000 inclusive. The function does not return any value directly but seems to imply that it might handle or process these integers within its body. However, since the return statement is not provided, it is unclear what specific output the function generates based on the given inputs.**
