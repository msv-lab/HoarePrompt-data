Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to solve the problem by simply printing `x // 2` for each test case. However, the goal is to find an integer \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized, not just half of \( x \).

To verify correctness, let's consider the example given:

- For \( x = 10 \), the function outputs \( 5 \). But \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\), which is not necessarily the maximum possible value. The correct \( y \) should be 5 because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\), but we need to check if there is a better \( y \). In fact, \( y = 5 \) is optimal here since \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\).
- For \( x = 7 \), the function outputs \( 3 \). But \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 6\), which is not the maximum possible value. The correct \( y \) should be 6 because \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7\), but we need to check if there is a better \( y \). Here, \( y = 6 \) is indeed the best choice since \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7\).

From these examples, it is clear that simply dividing \( x \) by 2 does not always yield the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
