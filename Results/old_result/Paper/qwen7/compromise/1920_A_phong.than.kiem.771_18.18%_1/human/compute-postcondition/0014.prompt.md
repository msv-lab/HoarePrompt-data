You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of multiple lines as described in the problem statement. Each test case starts with an integer n, followed by n lines describing the constraints as pairs of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `line` is the first input line which is an integer n, and `items` is a list of either the strings obtained by splitting `line` on spaces (if `space` is True) or the characters of the input line (if `space` is False).
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers converted from the items in the `items` list.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of either the strings obtained by splitting `line` on spaces or the characters of the input line, depending on the value of `space`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `space`, which is a boolean, and `to_int`, which is a list of strings. If `to_int` is not empty, the function returns a list of integers converted from the items in the `to_int` list. If `space` is True, the function returns a list of strings obtained by splitting each item in `to_int` on spaces. If `space` is False, the function returns a list of characters from each item in `to_int`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list of integers converted from the items in the `items` list.

Case_2: The program returns a list of either the strings obtained by splitting `line` on spaces or the characters of the input line, depending on the value of `space`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
