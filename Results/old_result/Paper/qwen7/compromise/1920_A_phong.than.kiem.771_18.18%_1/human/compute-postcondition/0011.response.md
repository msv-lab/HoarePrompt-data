Postcondition: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `line` is the first input line which is an integer `n`, and `items` is a list of either the strings obtained by splitting `line` on spaces (if `space` is True) or the characters of the input line (if `space` is False). The condition `(to_int)` is false.
