Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 0 (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).
- The value of `l[a[1] - 1]` is unknown.
- `re` is equal to `k` + 1 (though `k` is not defined, we only need to know the relationship between `re` and `k`).
- `res` contains the elements `a[0]` and `a[1]`.

We need to determine the value of `a[i]` where `i` is 3. Since `i` is 3 and assuming `a` is an array or list with at least 4 elements (because `i` is referencing the third index), the value of `a[i]` will be `a[3]`.

However, the initial state does not provide any explicit value for `a[3]`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[3]`. We can only describe it as the fourth element of the list `a`.

Given this, the output will be the fourth element of the list `a`, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function).

Output: **[a[3]]**
