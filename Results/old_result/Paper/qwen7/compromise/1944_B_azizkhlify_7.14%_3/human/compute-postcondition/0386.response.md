Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of 2n integers (a) for each test case, where n is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4, and k is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the list a. The function returns information based on the elements in list a and the values of n and k.**
