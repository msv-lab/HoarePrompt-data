Output State: **`i` is `n`, `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l`. Since `a[i] - 1` is the specific index mentioned in the initial state, the value at this index in the list `l` is incremented by 1. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
