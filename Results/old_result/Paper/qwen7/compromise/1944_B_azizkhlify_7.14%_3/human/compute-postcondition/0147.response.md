Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` is unchanged
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not directly part of the loop head)

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.

5. **Check if the loop condition is met**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` is now `n + 2`, the loop will continue if `n + 2 < 2 * n`, which simplifies to `2 < n`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The state of `r[a[i] - 1]` is not directly relevant to the loop head but is updated within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is unchanged**
