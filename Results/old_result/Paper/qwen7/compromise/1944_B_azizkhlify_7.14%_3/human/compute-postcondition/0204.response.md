Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `res` contains the value of `a[0]` appended with `a[3]`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `k` and `ul` are set such that the loop can proceed according to the postconditions
   - `re` is equal to `k + 1`
   - If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, we need to update these variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0 and greater than 4 (since `i` is now 4).

4. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now 4
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - The values of `res`, `k`, `ul`, and `re` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `res` contains the value of `a[0]` appended with `a[3]`, `k` and `ul` are set such that the loop can proceed according to the postconditions, `re` is equal to `k + 1`, and if `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
