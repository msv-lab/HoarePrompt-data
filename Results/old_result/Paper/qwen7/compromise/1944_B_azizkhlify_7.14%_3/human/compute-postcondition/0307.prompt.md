Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `r` will contain counts of how many times each index from the array `a` appears within the range `[n, 2*n)`. Specifically, `r[j]` will hold the count of how many times `a[i]` equals `j+1` for `i` in the range `[n, 2*n)`. The variables `res`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` will remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not affected by the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `r` will show how many times each possible index (from `0` to `len(a)-1`) appears in the subarray of `a` starting from index `n` to just before `2*n`. The other variables `res`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` will stay at their original values because they are not involved in the loop's operations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and `l` is a list where the element at index `a[0] - 1` is either equal to 4 or unchanged, depending on whether the condition `l[a[0] - 1] == 2` is true or false. Additionally, the condition `(ul == k * 2)` is satisfied, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, then `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged; otherwise, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is left as it was before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `l[a[2] - 1]` remains unchanged. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
