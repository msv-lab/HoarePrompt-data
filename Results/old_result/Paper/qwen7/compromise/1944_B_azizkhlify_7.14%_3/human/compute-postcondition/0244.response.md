Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n` (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`.
   - `n` must be less than or equal to 5.
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `ur` is increased by 2.
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Since `i` starts as `n + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop itself.

6. **Final state**:
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ur` is increased by 2, but since no additional information about `ur` is given, we assume it remains the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.
   - `ul` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, `n` must be less than or equal to 5, `i` is `n + 2`, `ur` is increased by 2, and if `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
