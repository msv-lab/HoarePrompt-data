Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is unchanged, `r[a[i-1]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r`. Here, `i` is initially `n + 2`. So, `a[i]` would be `a[n + 2]`, and thus `a[i] - 1` would be `a[n + 2] - 1`. Therefore, the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in the list `r` is incremented by 1. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
