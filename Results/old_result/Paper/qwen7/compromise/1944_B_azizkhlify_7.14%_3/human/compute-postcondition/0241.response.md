Output State: **Postcondition: `a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, `n` must be less than or equal to 5, `i` is now `n + 1`, `ur` is increased by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop or condition has been exited. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
