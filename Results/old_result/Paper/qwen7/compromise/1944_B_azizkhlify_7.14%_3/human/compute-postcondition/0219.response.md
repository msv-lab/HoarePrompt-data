Based on the initial state provided, `res` must be a non-empty list or iterable. The code snippet simply prints the value of `i` followed by a space, but the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know it must be an integer because it is used with the `end=' '` argument, which expects a string. The value of `i` could be any integer, but without additional context, we cannot specify it further.

Given this information, the output will be the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **i (where i is an integer)**
