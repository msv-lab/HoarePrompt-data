Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with one element incremented by 1 at index `a[4] - 1` + 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the element in list `l` at index `a[i] - 1` by 1. Given that `i` is 4, the index becomes `a[4] - 1`. Since `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `a[4]` is an integer, and thus `a[4] - 1` is also an integer. This index is used to increment the corresponding element in list `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
