Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k` before, it will be `k + 1` now.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.

Since the exact initial values of `i` and `n` are not provided, we can represent them generically.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.
