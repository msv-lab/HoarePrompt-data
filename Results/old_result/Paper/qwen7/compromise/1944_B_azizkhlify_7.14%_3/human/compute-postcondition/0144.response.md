Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by incrementing it by 1. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[n]`. The exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]` depends on the current value of `r[a[n] - 1]`, which gets incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
