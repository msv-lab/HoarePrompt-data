Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `r` with `n` zeros. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, or `l`. After executing the line `r = [0] * n`, `r` is a list containing `n` zeros.
