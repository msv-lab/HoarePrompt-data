Output State: **`i` is `n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. However, the initial values of `i` and `n` are not specified further in the code snippet, so they remain unchanged. The only change is that the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is incremented by 1.
