Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, and `ul` equals `ur` if the loop breaks due to the condition `ul == ur`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`. Each iteration prints `a[i]` twice and increments `ur` by 2. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point, the loop breaks. After all iterations, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`. The value of `res` remains an empty list because no elements are added to it within the loop. The condition `ul == ur` determines whether the loop breaks, but since the exact values of `ul` and `ur` are not provided, we can only state that if the loop breaks due to `ul == ur`, then `ul` equals `ur` at the point of breaking.
