Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.

We need to determine the value of `a[i]` to understand what will be printed.

From the given information, `a[i] - 1` is the index in list `l` that corresponds to the value 2. Therefore, `a[i] - 1` must be the index of the value 2 in list `l`.

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is the same as `a[0]`. We don't have the explicit value of `a[0]` directly, but we know that `a[0] - 1` is the index where the value 2 is found in list `l`.

However, without the actual content of list `l`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[0]`. But we can still describe the output based on the information given.

The print statement will output `a[0]` followed by another instance of `a[0]`, with a space as the separator between them.

Output: **a[0] a[0]**
