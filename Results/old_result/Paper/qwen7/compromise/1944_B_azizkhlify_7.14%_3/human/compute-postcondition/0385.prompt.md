Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `res` is an empty list, and `i` is `2 * n - 1`. If `ul` does not equal `ur`, then `i` is `2 * n - 1` and `ul` equals `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a string formed by concatenating the values of `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]` from the array `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `i` is `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ur` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
