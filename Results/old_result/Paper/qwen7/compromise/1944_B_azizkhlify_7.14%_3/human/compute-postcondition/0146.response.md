Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
