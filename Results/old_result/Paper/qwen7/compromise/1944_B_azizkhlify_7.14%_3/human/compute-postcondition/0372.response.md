Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from `n` up to but not including `2 * n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ur` retains its original value.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n + 1` and increases by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` should be `n + 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ur` retains its original value as stated in the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ur` retains its original value**.
