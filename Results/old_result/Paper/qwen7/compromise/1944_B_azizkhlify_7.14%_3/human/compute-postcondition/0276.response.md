Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially `n + 2` and `n` must be greater than 2, the value of `a[i]` is not specified, but it is used to index into `r`. Since `i` is `n + 2`, `a[i]` refers to `a[n + 2]`, and thus `r[a[i] - 1]` becomes `r[a[n + 2] - 1]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged, and `i` remains `n + 2`. Therefore, the only change is that `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
