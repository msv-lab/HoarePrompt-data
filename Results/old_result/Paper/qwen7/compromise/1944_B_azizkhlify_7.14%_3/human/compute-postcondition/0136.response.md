Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the element in list `l` at the index `a[i] - 1` by 1. Since the values of `a[i]`, `l`, and the exact index `a[i] - 1` are not provided, we can only say that the element at the specified index in list `l` has been incremented by 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
