Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `ul` is set to `i`, `k` is updated to `2 * k - i`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions. If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to 1, then `re` is set to `k` and the element `a[i]` is appended to `res`; otherwise, `re` is set to `k` and `res` remains unchanged.
