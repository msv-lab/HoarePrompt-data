Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `re` is 1, `res` contains the element `a[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 0, it appends `a[0]` to `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.
