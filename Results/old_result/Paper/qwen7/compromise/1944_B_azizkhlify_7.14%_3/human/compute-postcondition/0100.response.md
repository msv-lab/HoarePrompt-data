Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `ur` is `2 + 2`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since `ur` was initially not mentioned, we assume it was 0 before this line of code. Therefore, `ur` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
