Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `ur` retains its original value (though `ur` is not used in the print statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a` is a list, and `i` is an index into this list. Since `i` is `n + 2` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2 (since the smallest possible value for `n` is 1, making `i` at least 3).

The print statement will print the value at index `i` in the list `a` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **a[n+2] a[n+2]**
