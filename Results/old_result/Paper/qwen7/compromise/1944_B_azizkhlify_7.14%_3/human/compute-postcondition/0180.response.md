Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, and `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 6 (if the loop executed 3 times), 8 (if the loop executed 4 times), and so on until `i` reaches `n-1`. If at any point `ul == k * 2`, the loop breaks early and `i` may be less than `n-1`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1` (or less if the loop broke early due to `ul == k * 2`). The variable `n` will remain unchanged. The variable `ul` will be the sum of increments made during each iteration, starting from its initial value, with each iteration adding 2 to `ul`. If the condition `ul == k * 2` is met at any point, the loop will terminate early, and `i` will reflect the last index processed before the break.
