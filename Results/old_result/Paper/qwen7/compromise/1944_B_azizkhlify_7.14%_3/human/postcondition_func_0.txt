The function processes a list of 2n integers (a) for each test case, where n is an integer between 2 and 50,000, and k is an integer between 1 and n/2. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the list a. The function prints specific pairs of numbers based on the occurrences of these numbers in the list, and finally outputs a string formed by concatenating the values of `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]` from the array `a`.
