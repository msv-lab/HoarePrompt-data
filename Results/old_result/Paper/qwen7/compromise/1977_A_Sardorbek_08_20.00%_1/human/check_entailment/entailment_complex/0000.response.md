Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. This part is correct.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The condition `if b == c:` is correct; if the number of moves `b` equals the desired number of cubes `c`, then it is possible to achieve the desired state, and the function should print 'YES'.
   - The condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect. If `b` (the number of moves) is less than `c` (the desired number of cubes), it is impossible to achieve the desired state because you cannot add more cubes than you have moved. Therefore, the function should print 'NO' here.
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is also incorrect. This condition checks if the number of moves `b` and the number of test cases `a` have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, the parity of `a` (number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. Instead, the relevant check should be whether `b` (the number of moves) is sufficient to reach `c` (the desired number of cubes).
   - The final `else:` block incorrectly prints 'No'. It should handle the remaining cases, but the current implementation is flawed.

To fix the function, we need to ensure that:
- If `b` equals `c`, print 'YES'.
- If `b` is less than `c`, print 'NO'.
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then it is possible to achieve the desired state, so print 'YES'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

# The overall logic now correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement.
```

Given the above reasoning, the original function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
