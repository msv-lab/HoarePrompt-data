### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the conditions under which Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes. However, there are a few issues with the logic and the handling of the conditions that need to be addressed:

1. **Case 1: `b == c`:**
   - This case is correctly handled by printing 'YES'. If the number of moves (`b`) is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes (`c`), Nikita can simply add one cube per move, ending up with `c` cubes.

2. **Case 2: `b < c`:**
   - This case is correctly handled by printing 'NO'. If the number of moves (`b`) is less than the desired number of cubes (`c`), it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

3. **Case 3: `b > c`:**
   - Here, the original assessment suggests checking if `b % 2 == c % 2`. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution. We need to consider the net effect of the moves.
   - The correct approach should be to check if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the net change in the number of cubes must be even.

### Corrected Logic:

To correctly determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, we should check if `(n - m)` is even. If `(n - m)` is even, it means the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `m` cubes. Otherwise, it's impossible.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Annotated Code with Corrected Logic:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
    
    # State: The output state will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the corrected condition.
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was partially correct but did not fully address the logic required to solve the problem. The corrected logic ensures that the program correctly determines if it's possible to end up with the desired number of cubes.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
