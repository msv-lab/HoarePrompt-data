Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is greater than 0, `left` is decremented by 1, `leftZero` must still be less than (left + 1) // 2 or `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1. Since `left` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, `left` is still greater than 0. The conditions regarding `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged.
