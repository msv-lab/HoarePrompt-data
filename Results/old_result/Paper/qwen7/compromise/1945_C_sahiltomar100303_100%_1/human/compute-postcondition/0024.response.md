Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` must be greater than 1, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 3, otherwise `leftOne` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1, so if initially `leftZero` was 2 (because `s[1]` is '0'), it becomes 3. If `s[1]` was not '0', then `leftOne` was 2, and now it becomes 3. The other variables (`i` and `mid`) remain unchanged.
