Output State: **`i` is at least `mid + 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightOne` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code `trightOne += 1` increments `rightOne` by 1 again, making it increased by 2 in total. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
