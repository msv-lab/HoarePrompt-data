Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(mid)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `mid` is `n // 2`
   - If `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 4. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 4.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(mid)` means that `i` should be less than `mid` for the loop to continue.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since `i` starts from 0).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - Since `mid` does not change within the loop, it remains `n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `mid` remains `n // 2`.
   - The values of `leftZero` and `leftOne` do not change based on the loop itself, so they remain as they were.

Thus, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 4. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 4**.
