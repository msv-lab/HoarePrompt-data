Postcondition: `left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` will be between 0 and the total number of '0's from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, inclusive, `leftOne` will be between 0 and the total number of '1's from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, inclusive, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` is equal to `n`, `trightZero` is less than or equal to `rightZero`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `rightOne`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` still hold true, and `(abs((n + 1) // 2 - right) < abs((n + 1) // 2 - left))`
