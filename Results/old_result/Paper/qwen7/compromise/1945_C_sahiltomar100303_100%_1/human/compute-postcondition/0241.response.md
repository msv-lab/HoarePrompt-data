Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - 2` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is either equal to `leftZero - 1` and still less than half of `mid - 1 + 1`, or remains less than half of `mid - 1 + 1`, `rightZero` is either equal to `rightZero + 1` and still less than half of `n - mid + 1`, or remains less than half of `n - mid + 1`, `rightOne` is either increased by 1 or remains less than half of `n - mid + 1`, and at least one of `leftZero < (\text{mid} - 1 + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - \text{mid} + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial state, `left` was equal to `mid - 1`. After decrementing, `left` becomes `mid - 2`. All other conditions and constraints remain the same.
