Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 2, `leftZero` or `leftOne` is 4, `tleftOne` is 3, `leftOne` is 5**

Explanation: The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Given that `tleftOne` was initially 2, after executing this line, `tleftOne` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
