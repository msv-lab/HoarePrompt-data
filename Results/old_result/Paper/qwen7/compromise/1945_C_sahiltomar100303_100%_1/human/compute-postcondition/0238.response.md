Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is either equal to `leftZero - 1` and still less than half of `left + 1`, or remains less than half of `left + 1`, `rightZero` is either equal to `rightZero + 1` and still less than half of `n - left + 1`, or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1, and at least one of `leftZero < (\text{left} + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The condition that at least one of `leftZero < (\text{left} + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2` must hold true is preserved because only `rightOne` has been modified.
