Output State: **`t` is an input integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`.**

The code calculates the integer division of `n` by 2 and assigns the result to `mid`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
