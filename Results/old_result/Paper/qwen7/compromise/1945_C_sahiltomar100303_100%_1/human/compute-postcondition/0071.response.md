Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is an integer such that the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

The code `leftOne -= 1` decrements the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', this condition remains valid after the decrement. All other variables remain unchanged.
