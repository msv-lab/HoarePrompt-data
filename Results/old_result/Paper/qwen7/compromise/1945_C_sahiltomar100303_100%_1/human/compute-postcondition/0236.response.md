Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now equal to `leftZero - 1` and still less than half of `left + 1`, `rightZero` is now equal to `rightZero + 1` and still less than half of `n - left + 1`, `rightOne` is either increased by 1 or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`, and at least one of `leftZero < (\text{left} + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `rightZero` is updated to `rightZero + 1`, while `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` retain their original conditions. The relationship that at least one of `leftZero < (\text{left} + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2` must hold true also remains valid.
