Output State: **`right` is `right + 1`, `right` must be less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and then decreased by 1, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `trightOne` is decreased by 1, and `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was previously less than `n`, after the increment, `right` is now `right + 1` and must still be less than `n`. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.
