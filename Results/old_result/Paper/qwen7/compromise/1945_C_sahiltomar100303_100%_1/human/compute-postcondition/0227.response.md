Output State: **`leftZero` is equal to `leftZero - 1` and is still less than half of `left + 1`, `left` is equal to `mid` and is still greater than 0, `rightZero` is equal to `rightZero + 1` and is still less than half of `n - left + 1`, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was previously less than half of `n - left + 1`, after incrementing it remains less than half of `n - left + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
