Output State: All instances of '0' in the substring from `mid` to `n-1` have been counted in `leftZero`, and all instances of '1' have been counted in `leftOne`. The variable `left` will be set to 0 once the loop exits, indicating that the left boundary has reached the start of the string. `rightZero` and `rightOne` will represent the counts of '0's and '1's from `left` to `n-1`, respectively. `tleftZero` will be the cumulative count of zeros seen throughout the loop, and `tleftOne` will be the cumulative count of ones. The condition `left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` ensures that the loop continues until these conditions are no longer met.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `left` will be 0, `leftZero` and `leftOne` will hold the counts of zeros and ones in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightZero` and `rightOne` will hold the counts of zeros and ones from `left` to `n-1`. The cumulative counts of zeros and ones seen throughout the loop will be stored in `tleftZero` and `tleftOne`, respectively.
