Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is `right` + 1, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - 1`, and `trightOne` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original conditions and values. The updated value of `right` is simply `right + 1`.
