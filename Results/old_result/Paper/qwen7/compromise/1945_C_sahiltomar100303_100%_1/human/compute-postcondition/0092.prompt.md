Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is the total number of zeros in the entire string `s`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is the total number of ones in the entire string `s`, `tleftZero` is the cumulative count of zeros seen throughout the loop, `tleftOne` is the cumulative count of ones seen throughout the loop, and `left` is set to `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string, `left` is an integer decreased by 1, `rightZero` and `rightOne` are updated based on the character at position `left`. If the character at position `left` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1. If the character at position `left` is not '0', then `leftOne` (which was previously `leftOne - 1`) and `rightOne` are increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` is a string, `left` is greater than 0, `left` is decremented by 1, `leftZero` must still be less than (left + 1) // 2 or `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is a string, `left` is decremented by 1, `leftZero` is decremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is decreased by 1; `rightOne` must be less than `(n - (left + 1)) // 2` if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` must still be less than `(left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
