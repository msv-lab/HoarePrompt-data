Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `leftZero` is either 0 or 1 but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of `print(left)`.
- `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.
- `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring.
- `right` is explicitly stated to be `n`.
- `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
- `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`, but since `right` is `n`, this implies `trightZero` is negative, which doesn't affect the value of `left`.
- `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`, which also implies no change to the value of `left`.

The key point is that the print statement is simply printing the value of `left`, which is explicitly given as 0.

Output: **0**
