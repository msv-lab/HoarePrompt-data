Output State: **`left` is now greater than -1, `rightOne` is less than or equal to \((n - (left + 1)) // 2\), and either `rightZero` is increased by 1 when `s[left]` is '0', or `rightOne` is incremented by 1 when `s[left]` is not '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1, so `left` is now greater than -1. The conditions for `rightOne` and the increment rules for `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain the same but are adjusted for the new value of `left`.
