Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of `print(left)`.
- `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.
- `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring.
- The current value of `right` is `n`.
- `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
- The current value of `trightZero` is `trightZero - right`.
- The current value of `trightOne` is `trightOne - (n - right)`.

The `print(left)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `left`.

Output: **0**
