Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` equals `n`
- `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop
- `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop
- `left` is 0
- `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0
- `right` is not equal to `n`
- The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left`

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of `right`, which is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`.

Output: **n**
