Output State: **`i` is at least `mid + 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 (i.e., `rightZero` is now `rightZero + 1`).**

The variable `trightZero` is renamed to `rightZero` for clarity. The value of `rightZero` is increased by 1, while the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
