Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(mid, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `mid`.
   - `n` must be greater than `mid`.

4. **Loop Body Effect**: The loop body increments either `rightZero` or `rightOne` based on the character at index `i` in string `s`. However, the values of `i` and `n` themselves do not change within the loop body.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since `i` starts from `mid` and the loop condition is `i < n`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `mid + 1`.

6. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` becomes `mid + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than `mid`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`**.
