Output State: **`left` will be 0; `rightZero` will be the total number of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `rightOne` will be the total number of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `leftZero` will be 0; `leftOne` will be 0; `leftMove` will be 0; `left` will be 0; `right` will be `mid`; `trightZero` will remain unchanged; `trightOne` will remain unchanged; `t` will remain unchanged; `n` will remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `right = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. This does not affect any other variables. The value of `right` changes to `mid`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
