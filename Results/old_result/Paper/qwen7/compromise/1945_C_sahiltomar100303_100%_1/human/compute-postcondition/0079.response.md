Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2 or `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially greater than 0 (as per the precondition), it remains greater than 0 after decrementing. The other variables (`s`, `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`) are not affected by this operation, so their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
