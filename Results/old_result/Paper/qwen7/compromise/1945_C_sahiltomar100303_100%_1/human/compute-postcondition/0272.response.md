Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(right + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - 1`, and `trightOne` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Initially, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 2) // 2`. After incrementing, `tleftZero` becomes exactly `(right + 2) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
