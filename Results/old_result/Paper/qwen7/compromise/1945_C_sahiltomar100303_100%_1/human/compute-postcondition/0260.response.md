Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to 0, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2 - 1`, `tleftOne` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. Since `trightOne` was originally less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, after decrementing by 1, it becomes equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
