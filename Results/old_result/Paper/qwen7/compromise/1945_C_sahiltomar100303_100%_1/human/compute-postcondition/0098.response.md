Output State: **`right` must be less than `n` and the current value of `s[right]` is '0'; `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and is now decreased by 1; either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Since `trightZero` was previously increased by 1, it is now effectively back to its original value before the increase. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged.
