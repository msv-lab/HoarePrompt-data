Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `mid` to `n-1`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `mid + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`.

4. **Loop Body Effects**:
   - If `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 1.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mid + 2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `mid + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than `mid + 2` for the loop to continue.

7. **Postconditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` will have been updated based on the value of `s[mid + 1]` (from the previous iteration).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 2`**
