Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 6**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a typo and should be `leftZero`. The code increments `leftZero` by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
