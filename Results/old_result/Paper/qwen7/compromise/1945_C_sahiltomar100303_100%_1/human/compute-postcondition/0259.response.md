Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to 0, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. Since `tleftOne` was previously unspecified in the initial state, we assume it started at 0 (or an equivalent value that does not affect the conditions given). After incrementing, `tleftOne` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.
