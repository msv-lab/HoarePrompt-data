Output State: `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both zero, and the loop has exited because the conditions `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` no longer hold.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `right` will reach `n` since the loop continues as long as `right` is less than `n` and the conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are satisfied. Once `right` reaches `n`, the loop terminates. During each iteration, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` accumulate the counts of zeros and ones, respectively, up to the current position of `right`. Since `trightZero` and `trightOne` are decremented each time a zero or one is encountered, they will both be zero by the end of the loop. The loop exits when it is no longer possible for `tleftZero` to be less than half of `right + 1` or for `trightOne` to be less than half of `n - right + 1`.
