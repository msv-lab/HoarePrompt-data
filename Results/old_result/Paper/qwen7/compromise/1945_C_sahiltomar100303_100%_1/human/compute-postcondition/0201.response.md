Output State: **`i` is at least `mid`, `n` is greater than `mid`, and `s[i]` is not '0'; `rightOne` is `rightOne` + 1.**

The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `rightOne` is its original value plus one.
