Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`left` is 0**: This means the variable `left` holds the value 0.
2. **`leftZero` is either 0 or 1**: This means `leftZero` can take one of two values: 0 or 1.
3. **`rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`**: This means `rightZero` is the number of zeros in the substring starting from `mid` up to the last index (`n-1`).
4. **`rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring**: This means `rightOne` is the number of ones in the substring starting from `mid` up to the last index (`n-1`), and it is less than or equal to the count of '1's in this substring.
5. **`right` is not equal to `n`**: This means `right` is any value less than `n`.
6. **`tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`**: This means `tleftZero` is a value less than or equal to half of `n`.
7. **`trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`**: This suggests `trightZero` is being updated by subtracting the value of `right` from some previous value of `trightZero`.
8. **`trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`**: This suggests `trightOne` is being updated by subtracting `(n - right)` from some previous value of `trightOne`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(right)
```

Given the initial conditions, the only variable directly printed is `right`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `right` other than it is not equal to `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `right` without more information. However, we know it must be a value less than `n`.

Output: **right (where right is a value less than n)**
