Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` must be greater than `mid`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was previously increased by 1 before this line of code, it means `rightOne` is now increased by 2. However, since the exact initial value of `rightOne` is not specified, we only know that it has been increased by 1 from its previous state. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
