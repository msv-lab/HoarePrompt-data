Output State: **`i` is at least `mid + 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `i` is at least `mid + 1` and `n` is greater than `mid` before the execution of the code, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `rightOne` being increased by 1.
