Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` equals `n`
- `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop
- `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop
- `left` is 0
- `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0
- The condition `tleftZero < (n + 1) // 2` is true

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of the variable `left`.

Since the initial state explicitly states that `left` is 0, the value printed will be 0.

Output: **0**
