Postcondition: **`left` is equal to `mid` and `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is either equal to `leftZero - 1` and still less than half of `left + 1`, or remains less than half of `left + 1`, `rightZero` is either equal to `rightZero + 1` and still less than half of `n - left + 1`, or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`, and `rightOne` is either increased by 1 or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`**.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that all conditions are met regardless of which branch of the if-else statement is executed.
