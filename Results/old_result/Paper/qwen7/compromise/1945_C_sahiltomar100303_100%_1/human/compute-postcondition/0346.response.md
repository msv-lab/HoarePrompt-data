Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given code are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - Postcondition: If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` as 0.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

4. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i < mid`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `mid`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `mid` remains unchanged as it is determined by `n // 2` and does not change within the loop.

6. **Postconditions for the next iteration**:
   - The postconditions depend on the value of `s[i]` at the start of the next iteration.
   - If `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` will be 2.
   - Otherwise, `leftOne` will be 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2**.
