Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is either equal to `trightZero - 1` or remains the same, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid) // 2**.

The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its initial state to 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions or relationships described in the initial state.
