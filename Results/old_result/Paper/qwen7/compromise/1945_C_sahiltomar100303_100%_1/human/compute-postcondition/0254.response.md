Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to 0, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. The current value of `s[right]` is '0'.
