Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is 4**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a typo and should be `leftOne`. The code increments `leftOne` by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
