Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` is increased by 1, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` must be less than `n`, `trightZero` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
