Output State: **`left` is greater than 0; `leftZero` must be less than \((left + 1) // 2\); `rightOne` is increased by 1; `leftOne` is decreased by 1; `s[left - 1]` is not equal to '0'**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, `left` is still greater than 0, `leftZero` is still less than \((left + 1) // 2\), `rightOne` is now increased by 1, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `s[left - 1]` is still not equal to '0'.
