Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is decremented by 1, `leftZero` is decremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is decreased by 1; `rightOne` must be less than `(n - (left + 1)) // 2` if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` must still be less than `(left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. The conditions related to `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, and `rightZero` remain unchanged except that now `leftZero` is decremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', and `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0'. The condition for `rightOne` and `rightZero` remains the same as before.
