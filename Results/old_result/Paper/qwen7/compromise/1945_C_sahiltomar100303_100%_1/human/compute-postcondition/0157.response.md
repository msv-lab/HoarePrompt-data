Postcondition: **`right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop, `left` is 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0. If `left` is not 0, no change is made. Otherwise, if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, no change is made; otherwise, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then `right` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `right` remains unchanged as well.**
