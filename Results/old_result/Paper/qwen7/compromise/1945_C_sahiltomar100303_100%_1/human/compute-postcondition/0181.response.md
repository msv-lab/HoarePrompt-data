Output State: **`i` is 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 3**.

Explanation: The code increments `leftZero` by 1. Initially, `leftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', or `leftOne` is 2 if `s[i]` is '1'. Since `leftZero` starts at 2, it is incremented to 3. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `leftZero` are updated accordingly.
