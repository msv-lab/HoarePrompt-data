Postcondition: `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop, `left` is 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0. If the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then `right` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left`, and `right` remains unchanged as well.
