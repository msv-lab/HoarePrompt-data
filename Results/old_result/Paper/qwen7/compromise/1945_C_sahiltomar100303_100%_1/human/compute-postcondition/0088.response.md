Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is decremented by 1, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `leftZero` must still be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `left`, `leftOne`, `leftZero`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged according to the initial conditions provided. The condition involving `leftZero` remains valid as well, since `leftZero` is only constrained relative to `left` and `leftOne`, and neither of these variables has been altered.
