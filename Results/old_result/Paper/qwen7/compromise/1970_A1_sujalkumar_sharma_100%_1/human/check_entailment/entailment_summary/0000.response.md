Reasoning:
1. The program correctly computes the prefix balance for each character in the input string.
2. It then sorts these tuples based on the prefix balance in ascending order and by position in descending order.
3. Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list of tuples.
4. Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the implementation matches the required steps for performing the balanced shuffle operation.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
