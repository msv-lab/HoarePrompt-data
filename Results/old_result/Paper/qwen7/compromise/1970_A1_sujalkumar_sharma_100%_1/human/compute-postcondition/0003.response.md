Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` will be used as the loop counter, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` is the length of the string `s`, and it determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1, the initial value of `i` should be 0.
   - The value of `n` is already given as the length of the string `s`, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - The other variables (`s`, `prefix_balance`, and `balance`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`**
