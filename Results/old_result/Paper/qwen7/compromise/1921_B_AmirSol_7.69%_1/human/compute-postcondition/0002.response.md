The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). Since `i` is currently 0, the condition `i < n` will be true as long as `n` is greater than 0. Given the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `n` being greater than 0 is already guaranteed.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)**
