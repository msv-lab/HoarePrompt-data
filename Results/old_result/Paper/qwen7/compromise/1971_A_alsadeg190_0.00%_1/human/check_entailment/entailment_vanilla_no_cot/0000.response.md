Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program reads `x` at the beginning but then uses `x` and `y` within the loop without updating them. It should read `x` and `y` inside the loop for each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

This corrected version will properly handle each test case by reading `x` and `y` for each iteration of the loop.
