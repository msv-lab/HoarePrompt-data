Reasoning:
- The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case.
- The annotated program correctly processes the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads two integers (`x` and `y`).
- It then compares `x` and `y` and prints them in the required order (minimum followed by maximum).
- The logic inside the loop is correct: if `x > y`, it prints `x` and `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` and `x`.
- The program does not return any value but directly prints the results, which matches the problem statement's requirement.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
