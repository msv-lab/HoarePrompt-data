Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. According to the problem description, the input starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. However, the provided program reads only a single pair of integers `x` and `y` without looping over all `t` test cases. This means it will only process the first test case and ignore the rest. For example, if the input is:

```
10
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

The program will only output the result for the first test case:

```
1 9
```

And ignore the remaining nine test cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for handling multiple test cases.
