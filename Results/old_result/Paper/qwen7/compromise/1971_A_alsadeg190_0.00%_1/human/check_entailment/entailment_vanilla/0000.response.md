Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func()` is defined but not called. This means the function will not execute unless it is invoked somewhere in the code. Since the problem does not mention calling this function, we should assume that the intended logic is supposed to be executed directly.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The first line reads an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the next line reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Inside the loop, the input `x` and `y` are read using `input().split()`.
   - The values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)` and stored in a tuple `(x, y)`.
   - A conditional check is performed to determine if `x` is greater than `y`.
     - If `x > y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

4. **Expected Output**:
   - The expected output for each test case is the minimum value followed by the maximum value.

### Testing the Logic:

Let's test the logic with the provided example inputs:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 9`
  - `x = 1`, `y = 9`
  - Since `1 < 9`, it should print `1 9`.
- **Test Case 2**: `8 4`
  - `x = 8`, `y = 4`
  - Since `8 > 4`, it should print `8 4`.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 4`
  - `x = 1`, `y = 4`
  - Since `1 < 4`, it should print `1 4`.
- **Test Case 4**: `3 4`
  - `x = 3`, `y = 4`
  - Since `3 < 4`, it should print `3 4`.
- **Test Case 5**: `2 0`
  - `x = 2`, `y = 0`
  - Since `2 > 0`, it should print `2 0`.
- **Test Case 6**: `2 4`
  - `x = 2`, `y = 4`
  - Since `2 < 4`, it should print `2 4`.
- **Test Case 7**: `6 9`
  - `x = 6`, `y = 9`
  - Since `6 < 9`, it should print `6 9`.
- **Test Case 8**: `3 3`
  - `x = 3`, `y = 3`
  - Since `3 == 3`, it should print `3 3`.
- **Test Case 9**: `0 0`
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0`
  - Since `0 == 0`, it should print `0 0`.
- **Test Case 10**: `9 9`
  - `x = 9`, `y = 9`
  - Since `9 == 9`, it should print `9 9`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers and prints them in the required format. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
