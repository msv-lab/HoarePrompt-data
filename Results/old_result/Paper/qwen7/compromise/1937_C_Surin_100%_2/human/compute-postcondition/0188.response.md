Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 1, and the current value of `r` is equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `v2`, `v1`, and `r` remain unchanged.
