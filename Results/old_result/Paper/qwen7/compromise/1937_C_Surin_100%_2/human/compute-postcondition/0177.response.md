Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be at least 6
- `v2` is 1

The `print` statement is `f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'`. 

However, the value of `v1` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since `v1` is not defined and no default value is provided, it is reasonable to assume that `v1` is not assigned any specific value in this context. Therefore, when the `print` statement is executed, it will print the placeholders for `v1` as undefined.

Output: **? {v1} {v1} 1 1**
