Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is the input string from the user, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 2) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` is updated to 2, while `i`, `n`, `r`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`, and `g` retain their original values.
