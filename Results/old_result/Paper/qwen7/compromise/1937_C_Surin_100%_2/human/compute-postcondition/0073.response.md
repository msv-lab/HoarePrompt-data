Output State: **`i` is `prev + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i`, `r2` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to be equal to the current value of `i`. Since `i` was previously `prev + 1`, after executing the code, `prev` will now be `prev + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
