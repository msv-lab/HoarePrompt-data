Output State: **`i` is 3, `r2` remains unchanged if `r2` equals '<', and `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '=', `r` is an input string, and the stdout is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, since no print or input operation was performed before this line, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `r2`, `prev`, and `r` are as they were in the initial state.
