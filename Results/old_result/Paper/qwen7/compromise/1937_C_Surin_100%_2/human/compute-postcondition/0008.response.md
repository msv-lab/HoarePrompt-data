Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` must be at least 2 but its exact value is not specified.
- `v2` is explicitly set to 1.

The `print` statement is `f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'`. 

Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, it is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine its value from the given information.

Given the format and the information available, the output will include placeholders for `v1`.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 1 1**
