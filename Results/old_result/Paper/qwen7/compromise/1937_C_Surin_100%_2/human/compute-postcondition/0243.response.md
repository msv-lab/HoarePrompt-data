Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `r2` remains unchanged if `r2` equals '<'. Since no value for `r2` is provided, and there is no condition that would change it, we assume `r2` is not mentioned in the context of changing, so `r2` is likely unchanged from its default or previous state, but since no specific value is given, we consider it as not affecting the print statement directly.
   - `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '='. Since `r` is an input string and no specific value for `r` is provided, we cannot determine if `prev` will be 2 or not. However, the print statement does not depend on `r` or `r2`, so we can focus on the other variables.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3.
- `prev` is 2 (since `r` is not specified, we assume it follows the condition where `prev` is 2).

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 3 3 2 2**
