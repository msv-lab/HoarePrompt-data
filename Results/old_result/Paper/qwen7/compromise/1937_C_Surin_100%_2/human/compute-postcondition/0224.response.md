Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 6 (though this doesn't directly affect the print statement).
   - `r` is an input string such that:
     - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is set to 1.
     - Otherwise, `r` is either '=' with `r2` being either '<', and `prev` is set to 1, or `r2` is not '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.

Given the conditions for `r`:
- Since `r` can only be '>' or '=' followed by another character, and `prev` is set to 1 regardless of the specific value of `r2` when `r` is '=', the value of `prev` will always be 1.

However, the value of `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state and there's no way to determine its value from the given information, we cannot assume any specific value for `v1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `v1` and `prev`, where `prev` is 1.

Output: **? [v1] 2 [v1] 1**
