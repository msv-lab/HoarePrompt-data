Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending buffered data is written to the terminal. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `v2`, and `v1`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
