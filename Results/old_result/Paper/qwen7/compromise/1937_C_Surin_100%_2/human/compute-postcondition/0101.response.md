Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is either the string '<' or no string (if the if part did not execute), `v2` is 2, `v1` is 1, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
