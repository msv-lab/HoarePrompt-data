Output State: **`i` is `prev + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`, `r2` is an input string.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
