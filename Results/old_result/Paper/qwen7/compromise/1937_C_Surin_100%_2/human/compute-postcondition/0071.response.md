Output State: **`i` is `prev + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`, `r2` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously written output is actually sent to the standard output device (like the console). Since no variables are modified by this command, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `prev`, and `r2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
