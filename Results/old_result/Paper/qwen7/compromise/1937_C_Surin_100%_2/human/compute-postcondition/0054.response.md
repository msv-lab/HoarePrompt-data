Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is within the range [1, n-1].
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - If the current value of `r` is '>', then `prev` is equal to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `r` is set to '=', `r2` is set to the input string with the current value '<', and `prev` is equal to `i`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be within the range [1, n-1]. Therefore, `i + 1` must be within this range, meaning `i + 1` should be less than `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `prev` will be updated if `r` was '>' in the previous iteration, but since we are starting a new iteration, `prev` will be the value of `i` from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is the same as before.
- `r` is the same as before.
- `prev` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i` from the previous iteration**.
