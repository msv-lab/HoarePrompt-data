Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`.
   - `r2` is an input string.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `prev + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The loop will continue if `i < n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to `prev + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be at least 2.
   - `r` and `r2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given these considerations, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `prev + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`, `r2` is an input string**.
