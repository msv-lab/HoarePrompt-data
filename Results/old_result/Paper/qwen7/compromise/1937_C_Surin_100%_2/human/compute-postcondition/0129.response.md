Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `r2` is an input from the user.**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `r2`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `r` is not affected by this code. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` is still greater than 2, and `r2` holds the string input by the user.
