Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 6**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed, but this operation does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
