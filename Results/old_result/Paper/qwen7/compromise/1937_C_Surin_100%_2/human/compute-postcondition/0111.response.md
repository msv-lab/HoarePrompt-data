Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 2 (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement)
- `r` is the input string from the user (though its value is not specified and not used in the print statement)
- `v2` is 3
- `v1` is 2
- `prev` is 1
- `kp` is 0
- `g` is 0

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string with the values of the variables `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`. Specifically, it will print `? 2 2 3 3`.

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
