Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 1, `r` is the input from the user.**

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user as the new value of `r`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `v2`, `v1`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 6 is still valid.
