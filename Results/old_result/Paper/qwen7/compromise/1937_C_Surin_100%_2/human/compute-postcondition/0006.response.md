Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute because the range function `range(1, n)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n-1`. If `n` is less than 2, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `g` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `R` must return an integer that is at least 1, but this is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` will start as 1 when the loop begins.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at 1 and `n` being at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
