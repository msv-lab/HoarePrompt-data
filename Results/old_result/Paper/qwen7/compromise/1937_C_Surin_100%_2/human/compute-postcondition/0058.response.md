Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` equals `i`**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `n` remains at least 2, `r` remains an input string, and `prev` now equals the new value of `i`.
