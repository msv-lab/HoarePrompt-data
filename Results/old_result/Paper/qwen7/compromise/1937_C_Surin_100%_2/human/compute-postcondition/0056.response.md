Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i` from the previous iteration**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed output is displayed immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions without any modifications.
