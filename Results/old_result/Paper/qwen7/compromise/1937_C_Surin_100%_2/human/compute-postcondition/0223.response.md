Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 6
   - `r` is an input string such that if `r` is '>', then `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `r` is either '=', with `r2` being either '<' and `prev` set to 1, or `r2` is not '<'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 6.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 6
- The values of `r`, `prev`, and `r2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `r` is an input string such that if `r` is '>', then `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `r` is either '=', with `r2` being either '<' and `prev` set to 1, or `r2` is not '<'.**
