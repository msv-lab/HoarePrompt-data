Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1` if the condition `r == '<'` was true for all iterations, otherwise `v1` is 0.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `n` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `v2` will hold the value of `n-1` since it is updated in each iteration to the current value of `i`. The variable `v1` will be `n-1` only if the user input `r` was '<' for every iteration; otherwise, `v1` remains 0 as it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration unless the condition is met.
