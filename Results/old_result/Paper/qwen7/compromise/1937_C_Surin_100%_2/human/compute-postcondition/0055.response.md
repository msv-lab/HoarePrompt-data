Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is at least 2, but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is an input string, but its value is not specified.
- `prev` is equal to `i` from the previous iteration, meaning it holds the value of `i` before it was incremented.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `v1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we need to focus on the values of `i` and `prev`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `prev` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **'? [v1] [i] [v1] [i-1]** (where `[i]` is the current value of `i` after incrementing, and `[i-1]` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration, which is assigned to `prev`).
