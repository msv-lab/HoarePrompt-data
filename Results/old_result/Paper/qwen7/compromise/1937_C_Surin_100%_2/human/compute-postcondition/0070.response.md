Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `prev + 1`
- `n` is at least 2
- `r` is an input string
- `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`
- `r2` is an input string

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `v1` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. Therefore, `v1` must be a placeholder or a variable that is not part of the provided initial state.

Given the format of the print statement and the information available, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.

Since `i` is `prev + 1`, and `prev` is the previous value of `i`, we know the relationship between `i` and `prev`.

Output: **'? [v1] [prev + 1] [v1] [prev]'**
