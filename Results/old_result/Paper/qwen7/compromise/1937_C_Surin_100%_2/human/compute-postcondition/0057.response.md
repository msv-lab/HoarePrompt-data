Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i` from the previous iteration**

Explanation: The code `r = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `r`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `prev`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `n` is at least 2 and `prev` is equal to `i` from the previous iteration is still valid.
