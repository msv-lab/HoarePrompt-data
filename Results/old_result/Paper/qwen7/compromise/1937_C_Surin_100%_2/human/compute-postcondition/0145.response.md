Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `r2` is an input string**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `r2`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `n` must be greater than 4 is still valid.
