Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `r2` remains unchanged if `r2` equals '<'.
   - `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '='.

3. **Understand the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - The condition for `r2` and `prev` does not change the values of these variables; they remain as they were. Therefore, `r2` remains unchanged if it equals '<', and `prev` remains 2 if `r` equals '='.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `r2` remains unchanged if `r2` equals '<'.
   - `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '='.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `r2` remains unchanged if `r2` equals '<', and `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '='**.
