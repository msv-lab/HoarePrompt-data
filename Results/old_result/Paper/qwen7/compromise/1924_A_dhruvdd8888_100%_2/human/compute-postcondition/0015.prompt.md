Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ps` is the number of times a substring of length `k` containing only characters from the set `us` was found in the string `s`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each valid substring of length `k` found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
