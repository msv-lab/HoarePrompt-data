Postcondition: **`ps` is the number of times a substring of length `k` containing only characters from the set `us` was found in the string `s`. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each valid substring of length `k` found in `s`. The current value of `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
