Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly initializes variables and sets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if characters belong to the set `us` (first `k` lowercase English alphabets).
   - It maintains a window (`win`) of size `k` and updates the count of valid windows (`ps`).
   - After processing the string, it checks if `ps` (number of valid windows) is at least `n`.
   - If `ps` is at least `n`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and tries to construct a string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no valid substring of length `k` is found (`ps < n`).
   - It constructs a string that cannot be a subsequence of `s` by ensuring it includes characters not present in the last valid window (`win`).

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for checking if a string of length `n` can be a subsequence of `s` is sound.
   - The construction of the counterexample string when `ps < n` is correct, as it ensures the constructed string cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
