Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. The function takes an integer `t` as input, which indicates the number of test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format `hh:mm`.
4. It splits the string into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).
5. The code then manually checks the value of `h` and assigns the corresponding 12-hour format hour and sets the AM/PM indicator.
6. However, there are several issues with this approach:
   - The logic is repetitive and can be simplified using a more concise method.
   - The code does not handle the case where `h` is less than 12 correctly.
   - There's no need to handle `h` as a string multiple times.
   - The logic for setting `time` (AM/PM) is not efficient and can be improved.

A more efficient and concise way to solve this problem would be to use modulo arithmetic to determine the 12-hour format hour and directly set the AM/PM indicator based on whether the hour is greater than 12.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = str((int(h) % 12) or 12)  # Convert to 12-hour format and ensure 12 is used for 00
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')
```

Given the inefficiencies and redundancy in the original code, the original function is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
