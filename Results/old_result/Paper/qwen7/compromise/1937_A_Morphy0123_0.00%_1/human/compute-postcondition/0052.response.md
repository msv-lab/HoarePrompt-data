Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `power` is 3

3. **Determine if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true.
   - Currently, `power` is 3. Therefore, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `power` and `log2(n)`. Since `power` is fixed at 3, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.
   - We need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 3. This means `n` must be greater than \(2^3 = 8\).

5. **Final state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop condition.
   - `n_cases` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop condition.
   - `i` remains 2 as it is not part of the loop condition.
   - `n` must be greater than 8 to satisfy the loop condition.
   - `power` remains 3.

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
