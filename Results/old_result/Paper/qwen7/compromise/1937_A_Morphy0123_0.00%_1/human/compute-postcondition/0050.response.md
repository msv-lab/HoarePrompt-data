Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
- The variables at the end of the previous iteration are:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `n` must be greater than 2.
  - `power` is 2.

### Loop Condition Analysis:
- The loop will continue as long as `power < log2(n)`.

### Current States:
- `power` is currently 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.

### Determining the Next State:
- To satisfy the condition `power < log2(n)`, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2.
- This implies that \(n > 2^2 = 4\).

### Adjusting the States:
- We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 4 to allow the loop to execute one more time.
- The other states (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `power`) do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `power` is 2.

### Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 2**
