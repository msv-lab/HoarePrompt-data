Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 16, `power` is greater than or equal to 4.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until it is no longer less than the value of `log2(n)`. After executing the loop 3 times, `power` is 4. Since each iteration doubles the value that `n` must exceed (from 2 to 4 to 8), after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^4 = 16\). The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
