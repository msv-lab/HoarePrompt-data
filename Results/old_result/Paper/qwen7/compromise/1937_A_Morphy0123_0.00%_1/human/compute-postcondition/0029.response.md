Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `power` by 1. Since `power` was initially 1, after executing `power += 1`, the value of `power` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
