Based on the initial state provided:

- `power` is explicitly given as 15.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `n_cases` is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is 1, but this is also not needed for the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 32768, but again, this is not required to determine the output.
- The current value of `power` is equal to `n`, but since `power` is explicitly given as 15, `n` is not needed either.

The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`. Given that `power` is 15, the expression `2 ** power` calculates \(2^{15}\).

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **32768**
