Output State: **`power` is 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 8**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `power` by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
