Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 3**.

Explanation: The variable `power` was initially set to 2 and was incremented by 1, making its new value 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
