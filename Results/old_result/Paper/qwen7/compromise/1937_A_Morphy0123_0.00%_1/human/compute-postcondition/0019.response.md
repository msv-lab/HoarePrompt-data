Output State: **`power` is 14, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`, with `n` being greater than 32768.**

Explanation: The code `power -= 1` decreases the value of `power` by 1. Initially, `power` is 15, so after executing this line, `power` becomes 14. The values of `t`, `n_cases`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `power` is not equal to `n` (where `n` is greater than 32768) also remains valid.
