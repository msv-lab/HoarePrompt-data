Output State: **`sz` is 3, `k` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or iteration.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or iteration. Since the initial state includes that `rdb` still contains at least one element to iterate over, the `break` statement will cause the loop or iteration to terminate. However, the values of `sz` and `k` remain unchanged.
