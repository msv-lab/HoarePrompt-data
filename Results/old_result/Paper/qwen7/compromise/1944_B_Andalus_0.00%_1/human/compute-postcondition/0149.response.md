Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 11, `sng` contains at least 2 elements, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 10 to 11. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
