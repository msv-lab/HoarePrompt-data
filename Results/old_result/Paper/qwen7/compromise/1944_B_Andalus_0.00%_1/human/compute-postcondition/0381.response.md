Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one fewer element than before, `elem` is the element that was just processed from `ldb`, and `sz` is either incremented by 2 or remains unchanged depending on the condition `k - sz >= 2`. If the condition `sz >= k` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
