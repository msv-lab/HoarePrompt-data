Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is `2 * min(3, k)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `sz` is less than `k` and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. After the loop executes 3 times, `sz` becomes `6` if `k` is greater than or equal to 6. If `k` is less than 6, the loop will break before the third iteration, and `sz` will be `2 * k`. Since the loop breaks when `sz` reaches `k` or more, `ldb` will be exhausted, making it empty. The value of `rdb` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
