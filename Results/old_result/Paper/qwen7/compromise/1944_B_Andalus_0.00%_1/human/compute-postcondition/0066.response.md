Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is `sz + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of `ldb` or `sz`. The value of `sz` was updated to `sz + 2` before the `break` statement, so that value remains unchanged. The `break` statement itself does not assign new values to any variables but indicates the exit from the loop or conditional block.
