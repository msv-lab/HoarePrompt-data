Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 13, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `lst` by mapping each element from the input (split by spaces) to an integer. The original values of `ldb`, `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new list `lst` contains integers based on the input provided.
