Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- If `sz` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

Let's break this down:

1. The `elem` variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `rdb` contains at least one element, `elem` must refer to the first element of `rdb`.

2. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that there will be a space after the printed elements, but no newline.

Given these points, the `print` statement will print the first element of `rdb` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is the first element of `rdb`)
