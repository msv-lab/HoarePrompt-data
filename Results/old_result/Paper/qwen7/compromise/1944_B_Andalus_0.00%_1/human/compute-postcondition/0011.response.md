Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `1, n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 because the range is specified as `range(1, n)`. This means `i` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 1 and that `n` is greater than 0 (since `i` starts at 1, `n` must be at least 1).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
