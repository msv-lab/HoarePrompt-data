Output State: **`sz` is either 1 or 3, `rdb` is empty, `sng` contains at least one element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz`, `rdb`, and `sng`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
