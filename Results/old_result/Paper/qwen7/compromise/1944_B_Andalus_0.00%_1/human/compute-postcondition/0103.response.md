Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 3`, `sng` must be empty, and `elem` is the last element of `sng`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `sz` will be equal to `k + 3` because the loop increments `sz` by 1 with each iteration and runs for 3 iterations. The loop will break once `sz` reaches `k + 3` since `sz` cannot exceed `k`. At this point, `ldb` will be exhausted and thus empty, and `sng` will also be empty because the loop processes all its elements. The value of `rdb` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
