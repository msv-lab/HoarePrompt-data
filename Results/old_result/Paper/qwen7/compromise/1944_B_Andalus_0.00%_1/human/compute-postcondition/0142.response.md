Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is empty.
- `rdb` is empty.
- `sz` is 9.
- `sng` contains at least 3 elements.
- The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `sng` contains at least 3 elements, `elem` could be any one of those elements, but without more specific information about which element it is, we cannot determine the exact value.

Given the information, the most precise description we can provide is that `elem` is an element from the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the list sng)**
