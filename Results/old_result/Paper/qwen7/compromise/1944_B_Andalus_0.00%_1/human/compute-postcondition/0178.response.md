Postcondition: `i` is an integer where `i` is either 1 or less than `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, and `lft[i]` is either equal to `lft[i - 1]` (when `i` is 1) or not equal to both `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i + 1]` (when `i` is greater than 1). Additionally, if `i` is 1, `ldb` contains `[lft[i]]`. If `i` is greater than 1, `sng` contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it.
