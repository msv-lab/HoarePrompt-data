Postcondition: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one less element than before, `sz` is either 5 or 7, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` becomes 9. Otherwise, `sz` remains either 5 or 7.
