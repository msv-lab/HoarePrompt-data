Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than `1`, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable), `ldb` is now a list with the element `lft[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition regarding `lft[i]` remain unchanged. The list `ldb` is updated to include the new element.
