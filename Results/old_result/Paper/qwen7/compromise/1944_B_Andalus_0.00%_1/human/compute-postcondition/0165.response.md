Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 13, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `lft` is a list containing the first n elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index n, `sng` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `sng`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.
