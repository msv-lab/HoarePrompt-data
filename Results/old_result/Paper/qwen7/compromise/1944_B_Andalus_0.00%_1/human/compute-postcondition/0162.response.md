Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 13, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `lft` is a list containing the first n elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index n.**

Explanation: The code assigns the sublist of `lst` starting from index `n` to `rgt`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `rgt` now contains the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of the list.
