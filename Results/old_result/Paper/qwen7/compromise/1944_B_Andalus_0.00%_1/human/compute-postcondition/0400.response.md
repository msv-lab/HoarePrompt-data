Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

Here, `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since the problem does not provide any further context or definition for `elem`, we can only infer that `elem` is a variable that holds some value, but its specific value is not given.

Given that the print statement only involves `elem` and does not depend on the conditions related to `sz` and `k`, the output will simply be the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **elem (where elem is the value of the variable elem)**
