Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over `elem` in `sng`. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ldb` is empty.
   - `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element.
   - `sz` is equal to `k + 1`.
   - `sng` must contain at least one element.
   - `k - sz` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `sng` must contain at least one element, and the loop is iterating over `elem` in `sng`, `sng` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `elem` will be the first element of `sng` in the next iteration.
   - `sz` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified within the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` still contains at least one element, and `elem` is the first element of `sng`.

**State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 1`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and `k - sz` must be at least 1**.
