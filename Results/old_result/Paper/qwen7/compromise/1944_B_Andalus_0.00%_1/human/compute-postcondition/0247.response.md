Output State: **`sz` is 2, `k` is defined and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz` and `k`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code snippet, the values of `sz` and `k` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
