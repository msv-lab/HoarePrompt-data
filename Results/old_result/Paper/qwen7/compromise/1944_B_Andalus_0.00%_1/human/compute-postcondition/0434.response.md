Output State: **`sz` is 2 or 4, `rdb` must contain at least one element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: Initially, `sz` is either 0 or 2. After executing `sz += 2`, if `sz` was initially 0, it becomes 2; if `sz` was initially 2, it becomes 4. The value of `rdb` remains unchanged, and the condition that `rdb` must contain at least one element still holds. Additionally, since the code snippet only contains `sz += 2`, no other changes occur, and the previous condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid.
