Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. For each iteration, it checks if the current element `rgt[i]` is equal to the previous element `rgt[i-1]`. If they are equal, the current element is added to the list `rdb`. Since the loop continues until `i < n`, it will add all consecutive duplicates starting from the second element of `rgt` into `rdb`. Once the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all elements in `rgt` have been checked.
