Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `sz` is either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- If `sz` is 2, then `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 4.
- If `sz` remains 0, it means the condition `k - sz >= 2` was not met, and thus the value of `sz` stays unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for elem in rdb:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each element in `rdb`. The only variable in the loop head that changes during each iteration is `elem`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, `rdb` must contain at least one element. Since `rdb` already contains at least one element, this condition is always satisfied.

3. **Modification of `sz`**: The value of `sz` is determined by the loop body, but we don't know the exact modifications made inside the loop body. However, we know that if `sz` was 2 before the loop, it will remain 2 unless the loop body changes it. Similarly, if `sz` was 0, it will remain 0 unless the loop body changes it.

4. **Postconditions**:
   - If `sz` is 2, `k - sz` must still be greater than or equal to 4.
   - If `sz` is 0, `k - sz` must still be less than 2 (since `sz` does not change).

Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine the exact changes to `sz`. Therefore, we assume that the values of `sz` and `rdb` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
- `sz` remains either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` must still contain at least one element.
- If `sz` is 2, `k - sz` must still be greater than or equal to 4.
- If `sz` is 0, `k - sz` must still be less than 2.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element. If `sz` is 2, then `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 4. If `sz` remains 0, it means the condition `k - sz >= 2` was not met, and thus the value of `sz` stays unchanged.**
