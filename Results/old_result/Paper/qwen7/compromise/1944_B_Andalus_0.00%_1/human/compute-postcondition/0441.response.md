Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- `elem` is the first element in `rdb`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement:

1. `elem` is the first element in `rdb`.
2. Since `rdb` contains at least one element, `elem` must be a valid value.
3. The `print` statement prints `elem` twice, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

The output will consist of the value of `elem` printed twice, with a space in between.

Output: **elem elem**
