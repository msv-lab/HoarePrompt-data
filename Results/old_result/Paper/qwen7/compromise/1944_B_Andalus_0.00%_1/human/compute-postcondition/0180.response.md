Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`, and the range of the loop is from `1` to `n-1`. This means `i` will take values from `1` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer where `i` is either `1` or less than `n - 1`.
   - `n` is greater than `1`.
   - `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable).
   - `ldb` contains `[lft[i]]` if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n-2` (assuming the loop just finished its last iteration).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`, so `i` will become `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will now be `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `lft[i]` will be `lft[n-1]`.
   - `ldb` and `sng` will be updated based on the condition that `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `1`, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable), and `ldb` contains `[lft[i]]` if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it.**
