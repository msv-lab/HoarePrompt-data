Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 2`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the second element of `sng`, and we break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is encountered, which immediately exits the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain as they were at the beginning of the current iteration, and the loop is terminated.
