Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 2, `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is initially 1 and `n` is `i + 1`, `n` is 2. Since `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and `i` is 1, `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`. Therefore, `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[1]`.
