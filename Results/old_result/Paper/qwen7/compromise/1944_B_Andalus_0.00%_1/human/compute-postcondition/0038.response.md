Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`:**
   - We know that after the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 1 (the starting value of the range) and `n` should be set to the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
   - This means the loop will run `n-1` times.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and runs until `i < n`, `i` must be set to 1 initially.
   - `n` must be set to the number of iterations, which is `i + 1` at the end of the loop.

Given these points, the initial state before the loop should be:

- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is set to the number of iterations the loop will perform, which is `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `i + 1`**.

However, since `n` is the upper limit of the range and `i` starts from 1, `n` should be explicitly set to the number of iterations the loop will perform, which is `i + 1`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the number of iterations the loop will perform (which is `i + 1`)**.
