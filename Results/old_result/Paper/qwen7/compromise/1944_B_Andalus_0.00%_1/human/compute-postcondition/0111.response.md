Postcondition: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one element, `sz` is 3, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and if `sz` (which is 3) is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the variables.
