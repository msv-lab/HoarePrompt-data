Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 1`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and `k - sz` must be at least 1.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables remain in their initial states.
