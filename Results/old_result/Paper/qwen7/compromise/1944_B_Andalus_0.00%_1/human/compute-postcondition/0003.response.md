Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `lst`. The values of `T` and `k` remain unchanged, and `n` remains an input integer.
