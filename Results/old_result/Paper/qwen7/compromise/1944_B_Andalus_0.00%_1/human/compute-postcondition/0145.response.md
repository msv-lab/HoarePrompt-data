Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 10, `sng` contains at least 2 elements and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
