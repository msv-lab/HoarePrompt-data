Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `rgt` is a list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `rdb`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
