Output State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` must contain at least one element, and the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `sz`, `rdb`, or `k`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
