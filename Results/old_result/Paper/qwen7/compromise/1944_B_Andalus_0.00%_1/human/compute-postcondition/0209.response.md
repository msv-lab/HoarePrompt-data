Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element in `rgt`, and `sng` will not be mentioned in the problem as it is not affected by the given loop.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 up to but not including `n`). During each iteration, if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, the value of `rgt[i]` is appended to `rdb`. Since there is no else part in the loop, `rdb` will only grow if consecutive elements in `rgt` are equal. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. The variable `sng` is not mentioned in the loop or its conditions, so its state remains unchanged from the initial state.
