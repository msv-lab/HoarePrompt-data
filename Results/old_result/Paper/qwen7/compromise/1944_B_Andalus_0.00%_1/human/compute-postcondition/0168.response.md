Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` is set to 1 initially.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`ldb`, `rdb`, `sz`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
