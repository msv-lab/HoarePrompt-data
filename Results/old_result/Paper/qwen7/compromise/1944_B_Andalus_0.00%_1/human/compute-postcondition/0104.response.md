Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 3`, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `sng`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `sz` will be `k + 3` because the loop increments `sz` by 1 for each iteration and runs for 3 iterations. For the loop to run 3 times, `sng` must contain at least two elements, with the first element being printed in the first iteration and the second element being printed in the second iteration. The value of `ldb` remains empty as it was initially, and `rdb` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
