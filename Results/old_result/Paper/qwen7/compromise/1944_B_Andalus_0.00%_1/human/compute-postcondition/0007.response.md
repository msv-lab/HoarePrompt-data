Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, `rdb` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `rdb`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
