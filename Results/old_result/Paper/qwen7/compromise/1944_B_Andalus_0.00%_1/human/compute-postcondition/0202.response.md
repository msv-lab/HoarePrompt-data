Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `rdb[-1]` is equal to `rgt[i]`, and if `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then the value of `rdb[-1]` remains unchanged and is still equal to the value of `rgt[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 2, `rdb[-1]` (the last element in `rdb`) is now equal to `rgt[2]`. The precondition that if `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then the value of `rdb[-1]` remains unchanged and is still equal to the value of `rgt[0]` is still valid. However, since no information is given about whether `rgt[2]` equals `rgt[1]`, we cannot determine if the value of `rdb[-1]` changes from `rgt[0]` to `rgt[2]`. Therefore, the value of `rdb[-1]` is `rgt[2]`, and the rest of the preconditions remain unchanged.
