Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `sng`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 2.
   - `sng` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `sng`, at the end of each iteration, `sng` should have at least one fewer element than it had at the beginning of the iteration.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `sz` remains unchanged because the value of `sz` is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `sng` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 2, and `sng` must contain at least one element**.
