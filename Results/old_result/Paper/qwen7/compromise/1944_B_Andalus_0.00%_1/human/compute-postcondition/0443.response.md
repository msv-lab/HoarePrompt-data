Postcondition: `sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is less than 2, the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is not met, and `sz` remains either 0 or 2. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` becomes either 2 or 4, and `rdb` still contains at least one element with `elem` as the first element.
