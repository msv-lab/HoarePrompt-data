Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- The size of `ldb` (denoted as `sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

Here, `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since it is not specified what `elem` is, we cannot determine its exact value. However, the print statement requires `elem` to be printed twice with a space as the end character.

Given this information, the output will be two instances of `elem` printed consecutively, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem**
