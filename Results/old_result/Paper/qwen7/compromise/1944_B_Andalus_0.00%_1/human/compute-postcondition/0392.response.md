Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, `elem` is the next element to be processed from `ldb`, and `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz >= 2` and the condition `sz >= k` is not met. If the condition `sz >= k` is met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz < 2`, no changes are made to the state of the variables.
