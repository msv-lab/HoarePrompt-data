Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 1.
- `sng` must contain at least one element.

The print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since `elem` is not defined or given any specific value in the precondition, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will include the placeholder `elem`.

Output: **elem**
