Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng`. The variable `elem` is used to iterate over the elements of `sng`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `sz` is 3.
   - `k` is defined.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `sz` is 3, it implies that `sng` contains 3 elements.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the previous iteration, `elem` would have taken one element from `sng`. Therefore, `sng` now contains 2 elements (since `sz` was 3 and one element was consumed).

5. **Update the State**:
   - `sz` should be updated to reflect the number of remaining elements in `sng`, which is 2.
   - `k` remains defined as it is not directly affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`sz` is 2 and `k` is defined**.
