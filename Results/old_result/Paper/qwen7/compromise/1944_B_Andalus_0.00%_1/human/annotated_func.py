#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

    #State: `sz` is 15, `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, and `sng` is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of 2n integers (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) along with two integers n and k. It prints pairs of integers from the left half of the list and single integers from both the left and right halves, ensuring that no more than k elements are printed. If there are not enough elements to meet the condition, it prints as many as possible. After processing, the function ensures that `sz` is 15, `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, and `sng` is empty.
