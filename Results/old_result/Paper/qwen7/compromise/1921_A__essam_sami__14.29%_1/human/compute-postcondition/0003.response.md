Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the minimum value between \(n\) and \(x\) for each iteration of the loop. Here, \(n\) is calculated as \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\) and \(x\) is calculated as \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). For each test case, the program compares these two values and prints the smaller one.
