Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes t test cases, where each test case consists of four lines of input. Each line contains two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns nothing but processes the input to determine if the given coordinates form a valid square.**
