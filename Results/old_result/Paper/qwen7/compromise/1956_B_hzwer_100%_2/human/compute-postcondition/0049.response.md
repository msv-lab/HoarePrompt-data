Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `x` will take the values from the list `a` one by one.
   - Initially, `x` will be the first element of the list `a`.

3. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `x` will be the first element of the list `a` when the loop starts, we need to ensure that `a` is a non-empty list.
   - The variable `ans` and `cnt` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted here.

4. **Final state before the loop**:
   - `a` must be a non-empty list.
   - `x` will be the first element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element of the list `a`**.
