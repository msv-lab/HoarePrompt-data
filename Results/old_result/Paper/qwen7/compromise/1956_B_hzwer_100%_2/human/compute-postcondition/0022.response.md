Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is a list of length `n`, where `n` is the number of unique elements in the original list `a` after reducing each count by 1 if it was greater than 1.
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`.

Let's break down the calculation of `ans`:

1. For each element `x` in `cnt`, `max(0, x - 1)` is calculated:
   - If `x` is 1, then `max(0, x - 1)` is `max(0, 1 - 1) = max(0, 0) = 0`.
   - If `x` is greater than 1, then `max(0, x - 1)` is `x - 1`.

2. `ans` is the sum of these values for all elements in `cnt`.

Given this, `ans` represents the total number of reductions applied to the counts in `cnt`. Each reduction corresponds to an element in `cnt` that was originally greater than 1 in the list `a`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the total count of such reductions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of reductions applied to the counts in cnt)**
