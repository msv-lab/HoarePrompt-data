Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. 

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `x` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 and is now `cnt[x] + 1`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `x` is the second element of the list `a`, after the current iteration, `x` will be set to the third element of the list `a` (if it exists).
   - The list `a` will lose its first two elements because `x` was the second element and the loop is iterating through each element of `a`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `a` will now be the list starting from the third element (if it exists).
   - `x` will be the new second element of the updated list `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list starting from the third element, `x` is the second element of the updated list `a`, and `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1**.

To express this precisely:

State: **`a` is a list starting from the third element, `x` is the second element of the updated list `a`, and `cnt[x]` is now `cnt[x] + 1`**.
