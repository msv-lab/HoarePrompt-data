Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. It only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" but does not consider the overlapping cases or the optimal way to remove characters. For example, in the input "mapie", the program would count both "map" and "pie" but would not remove the overlapping "pie" efficiently. The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated string manipulation technique to ensure the minimum number of deletions.
