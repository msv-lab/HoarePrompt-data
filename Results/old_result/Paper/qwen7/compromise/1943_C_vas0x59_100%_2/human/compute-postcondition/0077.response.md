Output State: `ci1` is 3, `ci2` is 3, `c1` is `b`, `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]` and must have at least 2 elements, `c2` is 3, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7)]`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of 2. Given that `ci1` starts at -1 and increases by 2 each iteration, it will reach 3 after 3 iterations. Therefore, `ci1` will be 3 and `ci2` will also be 3 since they both increase together. The `ops` list will contain the appended tuples for each iteration, resulting in the specified list of tuples.
