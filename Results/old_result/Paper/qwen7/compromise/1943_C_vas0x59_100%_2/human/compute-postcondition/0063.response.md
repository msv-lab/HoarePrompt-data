Postcondition: `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, where each `ni` represents the sequence of nodes traversed until the condition `n == -1` is met, and the current value of `n` is -1, `ops` is an empty list, and the length of `path_ba` is even.
