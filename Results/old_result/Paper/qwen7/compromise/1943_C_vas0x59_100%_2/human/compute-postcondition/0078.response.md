Output State: `ci1` is -1, `ci2` is 0, `c1` is `b`, `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]` and has exactly 4 elements, `c2` is 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2. Given that `ci1` starts at -1 and the length of `path_ba` is even and at least 4 (since it must have at least 2 elements and `ci1` is -1, making the range start from 1), the loop will run until the second-to-last element of `path_ba`. If `path_ba` has 4 elements, the loop will run twice (for `i = 3` and `i = 5`). Therefore, `ci2` will be set to 0 after the first iteration and incremented to 1 after the second iteration. The operations list `ops` will contain the tuples added in each iteration, resulting in `ops` being `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]`.
