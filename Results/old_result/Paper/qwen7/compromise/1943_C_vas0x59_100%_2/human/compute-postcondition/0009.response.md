Output State: **`n` is 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` now contains the value `[v, u]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to `u` and `v` respectively, both decreased by 1. It also appends the list `[v, u]` to the existing list `u2vs[v]`. The initial value of `n` remains unchanged.
