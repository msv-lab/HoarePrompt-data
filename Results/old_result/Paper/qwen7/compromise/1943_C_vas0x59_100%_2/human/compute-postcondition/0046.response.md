Output State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n]` with `n` being `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, and `path_ba` is appended with `n`.**

In this output state, the variable `path_ba` has been updated by appending the current value of `n` to itself. The value of `n` remains as `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, which means it is the value of `previous` at the index of the last element in `path_ba` (which is `-1`). All other variables (`d`, `b`, and `path_ba`) retain their previous states. If `n == -1`, the most internal loop or if statement would be broken out of, but since the condition `n == -1` is not specified to be true, we assume it remains as calculated.
