You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3, u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and the input consists of n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to append pairs of indices (u, v) to their respective lists in `u2vs` until all possible pairs have been processed. After all iterations, for every pair (u, v) entered through the loop, both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will contain each other exactly once. 
    #
    #In more detail, if the loop runs its full course with `n` being the total number of elements, `u2vs` will represent an undirected graph where each node (index) points to every other node it has been paired with during the loop's iterations. Each node in `u2vs` will have a list of length `n-1`, containing all other nodes as they were added through the loop.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, where each `ni` represents the sequence of nodes traversed until the condition `n == -1` is met, and the current value of `n` is -1.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop has terminated because the value of `n` became -1, indicating that the path traced back through the `previous` list has reached the start node (index 0), or there is no further node to traverse as per the given conditions.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`, where `ci` is initially 0. After each iteration, `ops` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to itself. Since `ci` does not change within the loop and remains 0, the loop will only execute once, appending the tuple `(0, 0)` to `ops`. However, based on the given output states after the first three iterations, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or error in the problem statement since `ci` should increment with each iteration if the loop were to run more than once. Given the provided information, the loop only runs once, and thus the final state matches the state after the first iteration.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `ci1` is -1, `ci2` is 0, `c1` is `b`, `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]` and has exactly 4 elements, `c2` is 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2. Given that `ci1` starts at -1 and the length of `path_ba` is even and at least 4 (since it must have at least 2 elements and `ci1` is -1, making the range start from 1), the loop will run until the second-to-last element of `path_ba`. If `path_ba` has 4 elements, the loop will run twice (for `i = 3` and `i = 5`). Therefore, `ci2` will be set to 0 after the first iteration and incremented to 1 after the second iteration. The operations list `ops` will contain the tuples added in each iteration, resulting in `ops` being `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]`.
    #State: `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]` with at least 4 elements, `c1` is `b`, `c2` is 1, `ci1` is -1, `ci2` is 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]` if `len(path_ba)` is odd, otherwise `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]` if `len(path_ba)` is even and `ci` is 0, `i` is 1.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: 3
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: - The `*` operator unpacks these strings and `sep='\n'` ensures they are printed on separate lines.
    #
    #Output:
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3, and a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The function also processes `n-1` lines describing the edges of the tree. After executing the function body, the function returns None.
