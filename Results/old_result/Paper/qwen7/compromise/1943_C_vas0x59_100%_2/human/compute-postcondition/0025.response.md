Output State: **`d` is assigned the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the result of calling the function `func_1` with `d` as its argument. The value of `d` remains unchanged as it was initially assigned the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0. The variable `previous` is not used and its state remains unchanged.
