Output State: **`ci2` is 0, `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, where each `ni` represents the sequence of nodes traversed until the condition `n == -1` is met, and the current value of `n` is -1, `ops` is an empty list, and the length of `path_ba` is even.**

Explanation: The code `ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2` calculates the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and assigns the result to `ci2`. Since the length of `path_ba` is even and given as a precondition, `len(path_ba)` is an even number. Dividing an even number by 2 results in an integer, which is 0 in this case because the length of `path_ba` is even and starts from 2 (as it contains at least `[b, -1]`). All other variables remain unchanged.
