Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all pairs `(u, v)` have been processed. After all iterations of the loop, `n` will still be within the range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` will be a list of length `n` where each element is a list containing all nodes that are connected to the corresponding node via an edge. Each node `i` (0 ≤ i < n) will have a list in `u2vs[i]` that contains all nodes `j` such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`. The lists in `u2vs` will be bidirectional, meaning if `v` is in `u2vs[u]`, then `u` will also be in `u2vs[v]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `u2vs` will represent the adjacency list of a graph with `n` nodes, where each list in `u2vs` contains all the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node.
