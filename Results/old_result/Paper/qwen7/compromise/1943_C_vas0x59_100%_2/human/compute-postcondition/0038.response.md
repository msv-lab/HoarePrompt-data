Postcondition: `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1]`, and the current value of `n` is `previous[-1]`. If `n` equals -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. There is no change in the postcondition if there is no else part.
