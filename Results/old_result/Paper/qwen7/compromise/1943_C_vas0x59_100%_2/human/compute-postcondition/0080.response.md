Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0.
   - `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]` with at least 4 elements.
   - `c1` is `b`.
   - `c2` is 1.
   - `ci1` is -1.
   - `ci2` is 0.
   - `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]` if `len(path_ba)` is odd, otherwise `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]` if `len(path_ba)` is even and `ci` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len(ops))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `path_ba` contains at least 4 elements, it means `len(path_ba)` is at least 4.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, then `ops` will contain the tuples `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]`.
     - `c1` is `b`, so the first tuple is `(b, 3)`.
     - `c2` is 1, so the second tuple is `(1, 3)`.
     - The third tuple is `(1, 5)`.
     - Therefore, `ops` will have 3 elements.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is even, then `ops` will contain the tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]`.
     - This means `ops` will have 3 elements.

In both cases, `ops` will have 3 elements regardless of whether `len(path_ba)` is odd or even.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(len(ops))` statement will print the length of the `ops` list, which is 3.

Output: **3**
