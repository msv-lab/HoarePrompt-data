Output State: **`ind` is 4, `i` is 6, `p[1]` is 1, `p[4]` is 2, `p[6]` is 4**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` (which is 4) to the index `i` (which is 6) in the list `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `p[6]` is now 4, while `ind` and `i` retain their original values, and the other elements of the list `p` remain as they were.
