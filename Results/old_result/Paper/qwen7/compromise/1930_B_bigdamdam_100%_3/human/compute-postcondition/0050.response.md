Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, n, 2)` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `ind` is 4
   - `i` is 4
   - `p[1]` is 1
   - `p[4]` is 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2)` means that `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches a value that is less than `n`. 

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 6.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 6 to allow the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration should be:

State: **`ind` is 4, `i` is 6, `p[1]` is 1, `p[4]` is 2, `n` must be greater than 6**
