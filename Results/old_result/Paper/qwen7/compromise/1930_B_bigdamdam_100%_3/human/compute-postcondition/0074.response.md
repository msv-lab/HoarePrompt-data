Output State: **`i` is 18, `n` must be at least 19, `p[12]` must be at least 19, `p[18]` is `ind`, `ind` is 20**.

Explanation: The value of `ind` is incremented by 2, changing its value from whatever it was initially (at least 19) to 20. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
