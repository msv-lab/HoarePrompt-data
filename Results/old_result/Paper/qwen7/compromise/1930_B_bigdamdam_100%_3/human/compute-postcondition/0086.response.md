Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function processes `t` and `n` and returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a `t` and an `n`, and it processes these values according to certain rules or logic defined within the function body, returning a specific outcome for each test case.
