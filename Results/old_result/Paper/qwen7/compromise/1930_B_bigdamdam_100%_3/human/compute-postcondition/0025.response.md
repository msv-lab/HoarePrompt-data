Output State: The loop runs for \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) times since it starts from 1 and increments by 2 up to \( n-1 \). After all iterations, `i` will be \( n - 1 + n \% 2 \), `p[i]` will be `ind + 2 * (n-1)` (since `ind` starts at 1 + n % 2 and increases by 2 each iteration), and `ind` will be `1 + n \% 2 + 2 * (n-1)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the largest odd number less than or equal to \( n \), `p[i]` will be the initial value of `ind` plus twice the number of iterations, and `ind` will be the initial value plus twice the number of iterations.
