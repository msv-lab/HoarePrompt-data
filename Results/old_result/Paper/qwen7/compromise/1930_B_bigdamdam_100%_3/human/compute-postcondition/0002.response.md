Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` retains its value from the input. Therefore, `p` is a list containing `n` zeros.
