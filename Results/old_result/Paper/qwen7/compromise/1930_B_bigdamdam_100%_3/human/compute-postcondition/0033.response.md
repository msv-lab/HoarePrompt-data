Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1` and must be an even number within the range [0, n-1]; `p` is a list of length `n` with elements [0, 0, ..., 0, `ind` (which is `n`)] at index `i`; `ind` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` (which is `n`) to the list `p` at index `i`. Since `i` is an even number within the range [0, n-1], the list `p` will have its `i`-th element set to `n`. Also, since `ind` was `n` before the assignment, it remains `n-1` after the assignment because the code does not change the value of `ind`.
