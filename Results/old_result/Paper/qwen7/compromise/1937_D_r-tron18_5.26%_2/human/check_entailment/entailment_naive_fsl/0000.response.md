Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` seems to be attempting to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid, but it does not accurately model the pinball's movement and the inversion of the direction characters as described.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  <><
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 2 1 
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program does not produce the correct output. For instance, when the pinball starts at the first cell ('<'), it should take 1 second to leave the grid. When it starts at the second cell ('>'), it should take 2 seconds to leave the grid. And when it starts at the third cell ('<'), it should also take 1 second to leave the grid. However, the provided program does not generate these results.

The core issue lies in the logic of calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. The current implementation does not properly handle the inversion of directions and the movement of the pinball step-by-step. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
