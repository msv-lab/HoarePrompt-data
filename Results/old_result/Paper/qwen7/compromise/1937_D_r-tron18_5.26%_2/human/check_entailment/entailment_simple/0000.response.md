Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid where each cell has a direction ('<' or '>'), and the pinball's direction changes after each move. The goal is to compute how long it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid (`n`) and the grid configuration (`s1`).
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - The function `func_1` is called within `func_2`, but its implementation seems to have some issues, as it references variables (`n`, `times`) that are not passed to it correctly.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented and does not use the parameters `arr` and `times` as expected.
   - The logic in `func_2` for calculating the time to leave the grid appears to be complex and may contain errors, especially in handling the boundary conditions and the transition of directions.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Given the complexity of the problem and the provided code, it is challenging to verify the correctness without a detailed step-by-step analysis of the logic.
   - However, the provided code snippet does not seem to fully implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. The `func_1` function is not used appropriately, and the overall logic for calculating the time to leave the grid is not clearly defined.

Conclusion:
Based on the provided code and the issues identified, the program does not appear to be correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
