Postcondition: `nx` is a string starting with either 'F' or 'S', depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`. Specifically, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F' followed by the original string value of `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S' followed by the original string value of `nx`. `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.
