Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1; `b` is a list of length n+1; `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop; `j` is equal to `n`; `sa` is a list containing the element `1`; `sb` is a list containing the element `i`; `a[i]` is 0; `b[i]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 1, to the list `sb`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
