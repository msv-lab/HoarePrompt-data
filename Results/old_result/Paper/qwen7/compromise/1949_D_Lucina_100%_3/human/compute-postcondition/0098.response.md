Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. This means `j` starts from `1` and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than `0`.
   - `i` is set to `i_end + 2`.
   - `j` is `j_end + 1`.
   - The condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` still holds true.
   - If `x[j - 1]` equals 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` equals 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, if the current value of `j` is `j_end + 1`, the next value of `j` will be `j_end + 2`.
   - The condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` must still hold true for the next iteration. If it does not, the loop would terminate.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be `j_end + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (since the loop condition depends on `n` being greater than `0` and the range of `j`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, `j` is `j_end + 2`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` still holds true.**
