Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is updated to its original value plus the number of times 'F' appears in the string `x`, and `b[i]` is updated to its original value plus the number of times 'S' appears in the string `x`. The values of `a[j]` and `b[j]` (where `j` is the length of the string `x`) are each incremented by the number of times their respective characters ('F' or 'S') appear in the string `x`.
