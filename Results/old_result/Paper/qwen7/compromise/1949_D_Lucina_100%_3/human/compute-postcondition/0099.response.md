Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, `j` is `j_end + 2`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` still holds true; `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a[i]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
