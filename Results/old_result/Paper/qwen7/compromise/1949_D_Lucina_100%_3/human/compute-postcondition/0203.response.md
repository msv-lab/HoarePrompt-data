Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `n` must be at least 1, and the condition `xx[i][j - 1]` is either not equal to '?' with `nx` being the sum of its previous value and the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx`, or equal to '?' with `nx` being the string 'F' appended to its previous value if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is 'S'.
