Output State: **`nx` is 'FS', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the character at position `j` in `xx[i]` is either not '?' or '?', and if either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string 'S' to the existing value of `nx`. Since `nx` was initially a string either 'F' or 'S', appending 'S' to it results in 'FS'. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
