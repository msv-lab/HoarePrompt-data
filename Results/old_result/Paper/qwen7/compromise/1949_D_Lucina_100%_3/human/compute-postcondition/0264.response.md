Postcondition: `i` is 3; `sb` is a list containing the integers 1 and 3; `a` is a list of integers where `a[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged; `b` is a list of integers where `b[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged; `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and if `a[3] == 0` and `b[3] == 0`, the conditions remain as specified; otherwise, the conditions do not change.
