Output State: **`a[i]` remains incremented by 1, `a[j]` is incremented by 1, `n` must be within the range 2 to 24, `x[j - 1]` is equal to 'F'.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. The other variables (`a[i]`, `n`, and `x[j - 1]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `a[i]` remains incremented by 1, `a[j]` is incremented by 1, `n` must still be within the range 2 to 24, and `x[j - 1]` remains equal to 'F'.
