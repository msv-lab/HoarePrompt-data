Postcondition: `a[i]` and `a[j]` are integers. If `x[j - 1]` equals 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` equals 'S', then `b[j]` and `b[i]` are each increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b[j]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged, and `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each increased by 1.
