Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is `'?'`. Additionally, if either `i` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is appended with the character 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` remains as 'F'.
