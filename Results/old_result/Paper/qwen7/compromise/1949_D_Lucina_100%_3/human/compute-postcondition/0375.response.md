Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a 2D grid of size n x n, where each cell contains either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.'. The function determines the type of transition video (funny or scary) for the undecided cells ('?') based on the given constraints and returns the completed grid.**

Note: The function does not explicitly take any parameters but operates on a predefined 2D grid of size n x n, where n is constrained between 2 and 24.
