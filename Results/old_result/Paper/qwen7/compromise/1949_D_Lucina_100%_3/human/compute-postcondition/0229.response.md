Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` is `'?'`. Additionally, either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string `nx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `nx` becomes 'F', while `i`, `n`, and the character condition involving `xx[i]` and `j` remain the same.
