Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop is defined as: `for i in range(1, n + 1):`
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `nx` is a string that has been constructed based on the conditions inside the loop for all iterations from 1 to `n`.

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. **State at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `nx` is a string constructed based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Current State**:
   - `nx`: A string constructed based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `n`: The number of iterations performed so far (inclusive).

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 1`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `nx` remains the same because it is based on the conditions inside the loop, which are already considered.
   - `n` remains the same because the loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration, and the loop will increment `i` but not change `n` until the loop completes.

### Conclusion
The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to `n + 1` for the next iteration.

### Final State
State: **`nx` is a string that has been constructed based on the conditions inside the loop for all iterations from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains the same**.

However, since `n` does not change in the loop head, we typically only mention the variables that change or are relevant to the next iteration.

### Simplified Final State
State: **`nx` is a string that has been constructed based on the conditions inside the loop for all iterations from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`**.
