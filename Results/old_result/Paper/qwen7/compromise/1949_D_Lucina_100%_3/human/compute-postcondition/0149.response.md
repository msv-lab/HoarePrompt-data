Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `sa` is a list containing 1 and 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive), so the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - `n` remains the same unless the loop body changes its value, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 24\).

5. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition does not specify any changes to `sa` based on the values of `a[3]` and `b[3]` in this context, so `sa` remains unchanged.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - `n` remains within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `sa` remains a list containing 1 and 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 24\), `sa` is a list containing 1 and 3.**
