Output State: **`nx` is 'S' + the original string of `nx`, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is a string, and the code appends the character 'S' to `nx`. Since `nx` was initially a string, after appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S' concatenated with its original value. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
