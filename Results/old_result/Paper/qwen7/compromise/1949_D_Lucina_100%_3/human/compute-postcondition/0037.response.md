Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a[i]` will be the sum of all increments due to 'F' in the string `x`. Similarly, `a[j]` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `n`) will also be the sum of all increments due to 'F' at the corresponding positions in `x`. The variable `b[i]` will be the sum of all increments due to 'S' in the string `x`, and `b[j]` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `n`) will also be the sum of all increments due to 'S' at the corresponding positions in `x`.

In simpler terms, `a[i]` and `a[j]` will count the total occurrences of 'F' in the string `x`, while `b[i]` and `b[j]` will count the total occurrences of 'S'.
