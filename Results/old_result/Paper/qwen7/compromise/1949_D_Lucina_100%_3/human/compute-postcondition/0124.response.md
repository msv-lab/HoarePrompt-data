Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1, `b` is a list of length n+1, `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to `n`, `sa` is a list containing the element `1` and possibly `3`, `sb` is a list containing the element `1`. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` contains the elements `1` and `3`; otherwise, `sa` remains unchanged.
