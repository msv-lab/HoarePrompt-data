Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1 (since the range is `range(1, n + 1)`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `j` is 1 and that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `xx` is a list containing the string `x`.
- `a[i]` and `a[j]` remain unchanged and represent the total occurrences of 'F' in the string `x`.
- `b[i]` and `b[j]` remain unchanged and represent the total occurrences of 'S' in the string `x`.
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.
- `n` is `n_value`.
- `x` is the input string from the user.

We only need to adjust the states of `j` and `n` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the required state adjustment is:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
