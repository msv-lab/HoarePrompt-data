Output State: **`a[i]` is increased by 1, `a[j_prev + 1]` remains unchanged, `b[j_prev + 1]` remains unchanged, `b[i]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increases the value of `a[i]` by 1. Since the condition regarding `x[j_prev]` (whether it is 'F' or 'S') is not met here, the values of `a[j_prev + 1]`, `b[j_prev + 1]`, and `b[i]` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `j_prev + 1` is still valid.
