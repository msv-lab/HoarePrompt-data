Postcondition: **`i` will be `n+1`, `n` will be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` and `b` will be lists of length `n+1`, `xx` will be a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `n`, `sa` will be a list containing all integers from 1 to the highest index where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` will be a list containing all integers from 1 to the highest index where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. Additionally, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.**
