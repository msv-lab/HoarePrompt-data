Output State: **`j` is 2; `b[j]` is increased by 1; `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 2, `b[j]` (which is `b[2]`) is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `b[i]` being increased by 1 are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain as per their initial conditions.
