Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, and the condition `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; `nx` is now the string 'F' appended to its previous value.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is updated by appending the character 'F' to its previous value. The conditions involving `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, `j`, and `sa` remain unchanged from the initial state.
