Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, which ranges from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[1, n + 1)`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k` (where `1 â‰¤ k < n + 1`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`.

4. **Check the postconditions**:
   - `nx` is a string.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - The character at position `j` in `xx[i]` is either not `'?'` or `'?'`.
   - If either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, `nx` is updated to be the concatenation of its original value ('F' or 'S') and the character at position `j-1` in `xx[i]`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `k + 1`.
   - The other variables (`nx`, `i`, `n`, and `xx`) remain unchanged unless explicitly updated within the loop body, but based on the given information, they do not change outside the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the character at position `j` in `xx[i]` is either not `'?'` or `'?'`, and if either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, `nx` is updated to be the concatenation of its original value ('F' or 'S') and the character at position `j-1` in `xx[i]`, where `j` is now `k + 1`**.

To summarize the final state:

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the character at position `j + 1` in `xx[i]` is either not `'?'` or `'?'`, and if either `i` or `j + 1` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. If `xx[i][j]` is not `'?'`, `nx` is updated to be the concatenation of its original value ('F' or 'S') and the character at position `j` in `xx[i]`**.
