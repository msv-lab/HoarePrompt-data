Postcondition: `nx` is a string. If `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element) or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element), then `nx` is the original string plus 'F', `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S' followed by the original string value of `nx`, and `j` is `j + 1`.
