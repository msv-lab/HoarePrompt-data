Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the character at position `j + 1` in `xx[i]` is either not `'?'` or `'?'`, and if either `i` or `j + 1` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Initially, `nx` is a string, and the conditions related to `i`, `n`, and the character at position `j + 1` in `xx[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `nx` is updated to be the concatenation of its original value ('F' or 'S') and the character 'S'. Given the initial conditions, `nx` could be either 'F' or 'S', but after appending 'S', it becomes 'S'. All other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state.
