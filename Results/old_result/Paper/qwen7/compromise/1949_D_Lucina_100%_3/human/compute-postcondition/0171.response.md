Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `nx` is a string with `xx[i][j-1]` appended unless `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', in which case 'S' is appended if neither `i` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise 'F'; `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` from the previous iteration.**

This means that the value of `nx` is updated by appending the value of `xx[i][j-1]` to `nx` unless `xx[i][j-1]` is '?'. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then 'S' is appended to `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` of the list `sa`, otherwise 'F' is appended. Additionally, `j` is updated to be `k + 1`, where `k` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.
