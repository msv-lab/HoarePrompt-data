Output State: **`nx` is either 'SF' or 'FS', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with 'F', so `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FS' depending on its original value (either 'S' or 'F'). The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.
