Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. 

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is 2.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop increments `j` starting from 1 up to `n`.
   - If `xx[i][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to either 'S' or 'F' plus the value of `xx[i][1]`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` remains as either 'SS', 'FS', or 'SF'.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays the same.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `j` should be 3.
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we'll denote it as `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3**
