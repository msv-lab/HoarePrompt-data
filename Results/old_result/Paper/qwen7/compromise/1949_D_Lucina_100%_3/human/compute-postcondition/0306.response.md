To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the process step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `nx` is a string.
   - `j` is calculated as `2 * n + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `nx` is built by iterating over `xx[i][j-1]` for each `i` and appending characters based on certain conditions.

2. **Building `nx`**:
   - For each `i`, if `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', append the character from `xx[i][j-1]` to `nx`.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', append 'F' to `nx`.
   - If either `i` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` at any point during the loop, append 'S' to `nx`.

Given these conditions, the value of `nx` will depend on the contents of `xx` and `sb`. However, since the exact content of `xx` and `sb` is not provided, we can only describe the structure of `nx` based on the given rules.

3. **Final Value of `nx`**:
   - `nx` will be constructed by checking `xx[i][j-1]` for each `i` and appending characters accordingly.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', the character from `xx[i][j-1]` is appended.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', 'F' is appended.
   - If either `i` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, 'S' is appended.

Since the exact values of `xx` and `sb` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact string `nx`. However, we know the general structure of `nx` based on the rules described.

Therefore, the output will be the string `nx` constructed according to the rules provided.

Output: **nx (the string constructed based on the rules provided)**
