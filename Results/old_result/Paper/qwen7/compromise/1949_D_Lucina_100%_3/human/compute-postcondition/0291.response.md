Output State: **`nx` is the string with the last character 'S' added, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. The conditions for `nx` being a string with the last character 'S' added are still valid, and the values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
