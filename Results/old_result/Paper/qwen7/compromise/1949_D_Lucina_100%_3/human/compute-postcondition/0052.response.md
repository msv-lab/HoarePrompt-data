Postcondition: `j` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0. If the element at index `j-1` (which is `x[0]`) in the list `x` is 'F', then the current value of `a[j]` is increased by 1, the current value of `x[0]` is changed to 'F', and `a[i]` is increased by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then no changes occur to `a[j]`, `x[0]`, `a[i]`, or `b[j]`.
