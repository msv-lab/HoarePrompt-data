Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `nx` is 'F', `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the string 'F' to `nx`. Since `nx` was previously constructed based on certain conditions involving `xx`, `i`, `j`, and `sa`, the only change here is the direct addition of 'F' to `nx`. The 2D list `xx` and the value of `j` (which is defined as `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` from the previous iteration) remain unchanged.
