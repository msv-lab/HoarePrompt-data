Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where the j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. Each line contains n characters, and the characters can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video). It is guaranteed that the i-th character of the j-th line and the j-th character of the i-th line are the same for all i and j. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2 \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are F or S.**
