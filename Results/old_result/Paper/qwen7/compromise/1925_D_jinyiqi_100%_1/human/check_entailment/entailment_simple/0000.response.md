Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The key points include handling multiple test cases, ensuring the constraints are met, and computing the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - It then reads the friendship values for each pair of friends.
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs of children `cn2` using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \).
   - It computes the numerator `p` and denominator `q` of the expected value fraction.
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - Finally, it prints the result of \( \frac{p}{q} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

3. **Key Calculations**:
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as \( 2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1) \).
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as \( 2 \times cn2^2 \).
   - The gcd is used to simplify the fraction.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program uses modular exponentiation to compute the modular inverse of `q` and then performs the final calculation \( \frac{p}{q} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the limits on the number of test cases, children, pairs, and excursions.
   - It ensures that the result is computed correctly for each test case and handles the modulo operation appropriately.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
