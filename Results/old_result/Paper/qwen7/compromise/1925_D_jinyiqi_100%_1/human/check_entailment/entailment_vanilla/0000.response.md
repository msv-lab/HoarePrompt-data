Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions respectively.
   - It also reads the pairs of friends and their friendship values.

2. **Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates the sum of all friendship values (`sum_f`).
   - It computes the total number of unique pairs of children (`cn2`), which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - The formula used to calculate the expected value is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times cn2^2}
     \]
   - This formula seems to be derived from the problem statement but needs verification.

3. **Simplification and GCD Calculation:**
   - The numerator and denominator are simplified using the greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - The result is then converted to the required form \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Verification of the Formula:
The formula provided in the program:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times cn2^2}
\]
needs to be verified against the problem statement.

- The term \(2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f\) accounts for the initial contribution of friendship values.
- The term \(m \times k \times (k - 1)\) accounts for the increase in friendship values due to repeated selections of friend pairs.
- The denominator \(2 \times cn2^2\) normalizes the expected value.

However, the problem statement suggests that the expected value should be calculated considering the probability of selecting each pair and the effect of increased friendship values. The provided formula might not fully capture these probabilities and effects.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify with the given example:

- **Test Case 2:**
  - \(n = 5\), \(m = 2\), \(k = 4\)
  - Pairs: (1, 2, 25) and (3, 2, 24)

  - Sum of friendship values: \(25 + 24 = 49\)
  - Total unique pairs: \(5 \times 4 / 2 = 10\)
  - Expected value calculation:
    \[
    \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \times 4 \times 10 \times 49 + 2 \times 4 \times (4 - 1)}{2 \times 10^2} = \frac{3920 + 24}{200} = \frac{3944}{200} = 19.72
    \]

  - The expected value should be an integer, and the provided formula does not seem to match the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The provided formula in the program does not accurately reflect the expected value as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
