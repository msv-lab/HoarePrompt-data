Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `cn2` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2`; `j` is -1; `sum_f` is the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user; `p` is `p // gcd`; `q` is `2 * (cn2) // gcd`; `i` is 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The other variables (`gcd`, `cn2`, `j`, `sum_f`, `p`, `q`, `i`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
