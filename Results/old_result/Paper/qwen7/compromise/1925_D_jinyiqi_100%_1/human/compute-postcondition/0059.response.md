Output State: **`q` is equal to 2 * `cn2` ** 2, `p` is equal to 2 * `k` * `cn2` * `sum_f` + `m` * `k` * (`k` - 1)**.

This means that the variable `q` has been assigned the value `2 * cn2 ** 2`. The other variables, such as `p`, `k`, `cn2`, `sum_f`, `m`, and any other variables from the last iteration of the loop, retain their values from the last iteration.
