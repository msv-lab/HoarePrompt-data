Output State: **`p` is equal to 2 * `k` * `cn2` * `sum_f` + `m` * `k` * (`k` - 1), all other variables retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.**

This means that the variable `p` is updated to the value calculated by the formula `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `f`, `j`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `gcd`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`) retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
