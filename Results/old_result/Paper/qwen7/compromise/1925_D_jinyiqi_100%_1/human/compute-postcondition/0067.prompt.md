You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        sum_f = 0
        
        for j in range(m):
            a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
        
        q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
        
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        
        p = p // gcd
        
        q = q // gcd
        
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
        
    #State: Output State: All variables outside the loop remain unchanged, including `t`, `M`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`. After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, and the final values of `p` and `q` will be simplified by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`). The expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` will be printed for each iteration, resulting in `t` outputs, each representing the simplified fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) modulo \( M \).
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the loop will have processed all inputs specified by `t`, and for each input set, it will compute and print the result of the expression \( \frac{p}{q} \mod M \), where `p` and `q` are the final values after all iterations, simplified by their greatest common divisor.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4), followed by integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5). Additionally, it processes m lines of input containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i (a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9) representing pairs of friends and their associated values. The function returns different outputs based on the processed data for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
