Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is -1, `sum_f` is the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `p` and `q`. The values of `cn2`, `j`, `sum_f`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The `gcd` variable is now holding the greatest common divisor of the previously defined `p` and `q`.
