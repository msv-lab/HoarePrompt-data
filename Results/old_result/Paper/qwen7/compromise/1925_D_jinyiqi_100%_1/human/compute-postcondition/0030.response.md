Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `j` is `j + 1`, `m` must be the same, `a` is updated to the first integer entered by the user, `b` is updated to the second integer entered by the user, `f` is updated to the third integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `f` respectively. The values of `sum_f`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged. The new values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are the integers entered by the user.
