Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q`.
   - `q` is equal to `cn2`.
   - `p` is `p` divided by `gcd`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `p` and `q`**:
   - `p` is divided by `gcd`, so `p` is now `p // gcd`.
   - `q` is `cn2`.

2. **Understanding `pow(q, -1, M)`**:
   - `pow(q, -1, M)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`. This means it finds an integer `x` such that `(q * x) % M == 1`.

3. **Expression `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`**:
   - First, `p` is multiplied by the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`.
   - Then, the result is taken modulo `M`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` will yield an integer value after performing the operations described above.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the operations performed, the code will print an integer value derived from the modular arithmetic operations involving `p`, `q`, and `M`.

Output: **int((p // gcd) * pow(cn2, -1, M) % M)**
