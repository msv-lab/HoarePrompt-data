Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or `zeroes` - `cnt[0]`, `cnt` is [1, 1] if `c` is 0, otherwise it remains [0, 1], `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element, and `c` is the first element of `s`.
