Output State: **`s` must have at least one element remaining, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `c` is not defined in the initial state, it implies that `c` is a key in the dictionary `cnt`. The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
