Output State: **`cnt` is [1, 0]; `ans` is 0; `s` must be a non-empty string; `c` is the first character in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the character `c` in the list `cnt`. Since `cnt` was initially `[0, 0]` and `c` is the first character in the string `s`, the first element of `cnt` (which corresponds to the count of the first character in the alphabet, assuming `c` is 'a') is incremented by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
