Output State: **`cnt` is [1, 0], `ans` is 1, `s` must be a non-empty string, `c` is the first character in the string `s`. The value of `c` is 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Since `cnt[1]` is 0, the condition `cnt[1] > 0` is False, and thus `ans` is not incremented. However, `ans` was initially 0, so after executing the line, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
