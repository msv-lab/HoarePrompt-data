Output State: **`ans` is 2, `cnt` is [2, 1], `zeroes` is 1, `s` loses its first element, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- Initially, `ans` is 1 if the first element of `s` was 0, otherwise it is updated to `0 + (zeroes - cnt[0])`. Given the initial state, `ans` is 1.
- The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Since `cnt` is `[2, 1]`, `cnt[1]` is 1, which is greater than 0. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 1, making `ans` equal to 2.
- The values of `cnt`, `zeroes`, `s`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
