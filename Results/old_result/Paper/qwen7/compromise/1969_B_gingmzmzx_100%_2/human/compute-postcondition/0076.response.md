Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `c` which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is a list with two elements: `[1, 0]`.
   - `ans` is either `1` if the first character `c` in the string `s` is `0`, or `-1` if `c` is not equal to `0`.

3. **Determine the current state of the loop**:
   - Since `cnt` is `[1, 0]`, it implies that the first character `c` in the string `s` has been checked and found to be `0` (because the first element of `cnt` is `1`).
   - Therefore, `ans` should be `1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in the string `s` needs to be checked.
   - The `cnt` list will be updated based on the value of the next character `c`.
   - If the next character `c` is `0`, the first element of `cnt` will remain `1`, and the second element will be updated to reflect the count of non-zero characters encountered so far.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the next character `c`.
   - `ans` will remain `1` unless the next character `c` is not `0`, in which case `ans` will be updated to `-1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `cnt` will be updated based on the next character `c`.
- `ans` will remain `1` unless the next character `c` is not `0`.

Since we don't know the exact value of the next character `c`, we can only update `cnt` and keep `ans` as `1` until further information is provided.

**Final State:**
State: **`cnt` is [1, 0 if the next character is 0 else 1], `ans` is 1**
