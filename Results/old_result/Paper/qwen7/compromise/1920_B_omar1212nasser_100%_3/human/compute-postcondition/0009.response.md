Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` represents the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` represents the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers between 1 and 1000. It calculates a series of values using the formula `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration, where `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements of `elements`. Finally, it returns the maximum value among these calculated values.**
