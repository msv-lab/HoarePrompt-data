### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It sorts the array, which is crucial for the optimal strategy since Alice will want to remove the smallest elements and Bob will want to negate the largest elements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves.
   - It initializes the total sum `s` of the array and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `s2`.
   - It iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `removals`) and for each iteration, it updates the sums `s` and `s2` accordingly.
   - It calculates the possible sum after each combination of removals and negations and stores these values in the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the optimal sum of the array.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will remove the smallest elements to minimize the negative impact on the sum.
   - Bob will negate the largest elements to minimize the positive impact on the sum.
   - The function correctly simulates all possible combinations of these actions and returns the best possible outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when Alice removes all elements or when Bob negates all elements.
   - It correctly updates the sums in each iteration to ensure the optimal sum is calculated.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the logic implemented in the functions, the original assessment is accurate.
