### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`:
- Reads the number of test cases (`t`).
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
- It then reads the array `a` and sorts it.
- Finally, it calls `func_2` with the sorted array and prints the result.

#### Function `func_2`:
- Takes three parameters: `removals` (number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (the sorted array).
- Initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums after optimal moves.
- Calculates the initial sum of the array (`s`).
- Appends the initial sum minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements to `pos`.
- Iterates from 1 to `removals`:
  - Updates `s` by subtracting the current largest element.
  - Updates `s2` (sum of the last `negatives` elements) by subtracting the current largest element.
  - If the number of elements removed plus the number of elements multiplied by -1 is within bounds, it adds the current largest element back to `s2`.
  - Appends the updated `s` minus twice the updated `s2` to `pos`.
- Returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array is crucial because Alice will want to remove the smallest elements to minimize their impact, and Bob will want to negate the largest elements to minimize the sum.

2. **Calculating Possible Sums**:
   - The function correctly considers all possible combinations of elements removed by Alice and negated by Bob.
   - It ensures that the sum of the array is calculated optimally by considering different scenarios where Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob negates up to `x` elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when Alice removes all elements or when Bob negates all elements.
   - It correctly updates the sum and the sum of the last `negatives` elements in each iteration.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will remove the smallest elements to minimize their contribution to the sum.
   - Bob will negate the largest elements to minimize the overall sum.
   - The function correctly simulates these strategies by iterating through possible removals and negations.

### Verification

- The sorting step ensures that the smallest elements are considered for removal first.
- The loop structure correctly evaluates all possible combinations of removals and negations.
- The calculations inside the loop are accurate and reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves. Therefore, the program is correct.
