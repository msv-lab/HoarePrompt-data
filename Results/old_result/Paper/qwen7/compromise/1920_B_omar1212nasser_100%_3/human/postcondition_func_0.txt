The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads in values for \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers. It then sorts the list of integers and calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` with these parameters. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results of `func_2` for each test case.
