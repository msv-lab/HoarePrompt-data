Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list containing two elements, each element is an input value from the user; `n` is an input integer.

This means after the loop executes, the list `a` will contain two input values provided by the user, while `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
