Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by the array `a` itself. It sorts the array and calculates the count of the middle element (median) in the sorted array. For each test case, it prints the count of the middle element. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the count of the middle element for each test case.**
