Output State: **`i` is 1; `back` is `cities[0]`; `forward` is either `cities[2]` (if `i < n - 1`) or `back` remains `cities[0]` (if `i` is not less than `n - 1`); `prog_cities[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `prog_cities[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to `prog_cities` at the index `i`. Since `i` is 1, `prog_cities[1]` is now 1. The values of `i`, `back`, and `forward` remain unchanged from their initial states.
