Output State: **`i` is 2, `back` is `cities[0]`, `forward` is either `cities[2]` (if `i < n - 1`) or `back` remains `cities[0]` (if `i` is not less than `n - 1`), `prog_cities[1]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
- The value of `forward` is used in the calculation, which is either `cities[2]` if `i < n - 1` or `back` (which is `cities[0]`) if `i` is not less than `n - 1`.
- The value of `prog_cities[1]` is updated to be the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[1]`.
