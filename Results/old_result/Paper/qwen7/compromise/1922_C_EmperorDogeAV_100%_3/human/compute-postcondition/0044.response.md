Postcondition: `back` is either `cities[i - 1]` if `i > 0`, or remains `-99999999999999999999`. `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, or remains `999999999999999999` if `i >= n - 1`. `prog_cities[1]` remains `|cities[2] - cities[1]|`. `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is updated to `abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])` if `i < n - 1`, or remains unchanged if `i >= n - 1`.
