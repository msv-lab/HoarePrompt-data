Postcondition: `i` is 0, `back` is -99999999999999999999, and `forward` is the value of `cities[1]`. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, then `prog_cities[0]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[0]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[0]`.
