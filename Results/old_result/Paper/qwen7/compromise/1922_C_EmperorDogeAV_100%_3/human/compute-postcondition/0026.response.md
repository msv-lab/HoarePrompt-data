Output State: **`i` is 1, `back` is `cities[0]`, `forward` is `cities[2]`.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 1, `back` is `cities[0]`, and `forward` is 999999999999999999. The code updates `forward` to `cities[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2, so `forward` is now `cities[2]`. The values of `i` and `back` remain unchanged.
