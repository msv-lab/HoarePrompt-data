### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program calls `func_1` to generate two lists: `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`. These lists store the distance to the closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - The program then reverses the list of cities and generates another pair of lists: `backward_cities` and `forward_cities` in reverse order.
   - It calculates prefix sums for both `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` to facilitate quick lookups for the minimum cost of travel.
   - Finally, it processes each query to find the minimum cost of travel from one city to another using the prefix sums.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function determines the closest city for each city by comparing the distances to the neighboring cities.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, it sets the corresponding element in `prog_cities` to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the current and next city coordinates.

Given the problem constraints and the example provided, let's validate the logic of `func_1` and the overall program:

- **Closest City Logic:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the neighboring cities. However, it does not explicitly ensure that the closest city is unique for each city. This is a minor issue because the problem statement guarantees that for each city, the closest city is unique.

- **Prefix Sums Calculation:**
  - The program calculates prefix sums for both `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`. The prefix sums are used to quickly determine the minimum cost of travel from one city to another.
  - The logic to compute the prefix sums is correct. For each query, the program uses the prefix sums to find the minimum cost of travel efficiently.

- **Query Processing:**
  - The program processes each query correctly by using the prefix sums to determine the minimum cost of travel. It handles both cases where the starting city is less than the destination city and vice versa.

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct in terms of logic and implementation. The original assessment incorrectly pointed out issues with the closest city logic and the prefix sums calculation, but these issues are not present in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided example.
