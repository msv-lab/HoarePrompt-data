### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Step 1: Understanding the `func_1` Function
The `func_1` function aims to determine the closest city for each city in the list. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks the distance to the next and previous cities and sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the next city is closer, otherwise it sets it to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city. This logic does not guarantee that the closest city is unique for each city.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
- If the next city is closer, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1, which means the closest city is the next city.
- If the next city is not closer, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.

This approach does not ensure that the closest city is unique for each city. For example, consider the cities `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. According to the problem statement, the closest city to each city is:
- City 1: City 2 (distance 8)
- City 2: City 3 (distance 4)
- City 3: City 4 (distance 3)
- City 4: City 3 (distance 3)
- City 5: City 4 (distance 5)

However, the `func_1` function might produce different results because it does not handle the unique closest city condition properly.

#### Step 2: Understanding the Main Program Logic
The main program logic involves computing prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) to determine the minimum cost of travel. The program assumes that the closest city is the one with the smallest absolute difference, but this assumption is not always correct due to the issues in `func_1`.

- The program reverses the `cities` list and calls `func_1` again to compute `backward_cities`.
- It then computes the prefix sums for both `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.
- Finally, it processes each query by comparing the indices and printing the appropriate prefix sum difference.

Given the issues in `func_1`, the prefix sums might not be correctly computed, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

#### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city for each city. The `func_1` function does not ensure that the closest city is unique for each city, and the main program logic relies on this incorrect assumption.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the closest city for each city, leading to potentially incorrect results for the queries.
