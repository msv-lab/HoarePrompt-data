### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities, where the cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of traveling directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates a list `prog_cities` where each element represents the cost of moving to the next closest city.
   - It correctly identifies whether the next closest city is the one immediately before or after the current city and assigns the appropriate value (either 1 or the absolute difference).

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program processes each test case by:
     - Reading the number of cities `n` and their coordinates.
     - Computing `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` using `func_1`.
     - Precomputing prefix sums for both directions.
     - Processing each query to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities using the precomputed prefix sums.

4. **Prefix Sums**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are used to quickly compute the cumulative cost of moving to the closest city up to a certain point.
   - These sums are correctly computed and reversed for the backward direction.

5. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program correctly uses the prefix sums to determine the minimum cost based on the relative positions of the start and end cities.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the start and end cities are in different directions efficiently using the precomputed prefix sums.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. There are no logical errors or misinterpretations in the code.

### Correctness:
**True**
