### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost depends on whether you choose to move to the closest city or any other city.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to compute the distance to the closest city for each city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are lists that store these distances in forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, used to quickly calculate the sum of distances for any subarray.
   - Queries are answered using these prefix sums.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each city and calculates the distance to the closest city by comparing distances to the previous and next cities.
   - This logic seems correct for determining the closest city. However, there is a flaw in the logic. The function should determine the closest city based on the smallest distance, but it incorrectly sets the value to 1 if the forward distance is smaller, which is not always the closest city.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are correctly computed as prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

5. **Query Handling**:
   - The code correctly handles the queries by using the appropriate prefix sum arrays based on the direction of travel (forward or backward).
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is sound, but it relies on the incorrect values generated by `func_1`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the city indices might be reversed in queries, ensuring the correct prefix sum is used.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not correctly determine the closest city. The logic inside `func_1` incorrectly sets the value to 1 when the forward distance is smaller, which is not always the closest city. Therefore, the prefix sums and subsequent query handling are based on incorrect data.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function, which does not correctly determine the closest city for each city.
