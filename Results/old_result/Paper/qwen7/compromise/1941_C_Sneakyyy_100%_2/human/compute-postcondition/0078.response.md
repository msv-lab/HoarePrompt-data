Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `a` is a new string input by the user, `i` is 3, and the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'. If the substring `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `ans` is 0, `a` is a new string input by the user, `i` is 1, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 0 and having a length of 3.
