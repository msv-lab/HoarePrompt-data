Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 3, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3, and the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.
