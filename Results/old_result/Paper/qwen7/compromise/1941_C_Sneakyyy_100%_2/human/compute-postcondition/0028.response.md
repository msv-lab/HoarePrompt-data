Postcondition: `ans` is 3 (or 2 or 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 10, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and ending at index 10 and is equal to `a[7:10]` if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'. Otherwise, `ans` is 2 (or 1 or 0), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 8, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and ending at index 10 and is equal to `a[7:10]`.
