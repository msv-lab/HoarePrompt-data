Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, and `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which is either 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables (`n`, `a`, `i`, and `s`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
