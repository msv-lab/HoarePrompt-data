Output State: `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `a`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the string input by the user, `i` is the final index value where the loop terminates, and `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which is either 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the count of how many times the substrings 'map' and 'pie' appear in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be set to the index just beyond the last matched substring, and `s` will be the last matched substring of length 3, or it will not exist if no matches were found.
