Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to count the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the given string `s`. However, the logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for overlapping occurrences of these substrings. The program increments the index `i` by 3 every time it finds 'map' or 'pie', which means it skips over potential overlaps. For example, in the string "ppieeppiee", the program would only count one occurrence of 'pie' instead of two.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we correctly handle overlapping substrings. One way to do this is to use a more sophisticated approach such as dynamic programming or a sliding window technique.

Given the current implementation, the program does not meet the requirement of minimizing the number of deletions to make the string beautiful. Instead, it simply counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie'.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
