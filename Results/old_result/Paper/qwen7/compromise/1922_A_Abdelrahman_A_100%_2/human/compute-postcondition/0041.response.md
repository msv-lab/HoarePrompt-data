Postcondition: `no` is False, `tests` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `c` has at least as many characters as the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is the last character in the string `c`, the counter is equal to the length of `c` + 1, and `x` is not in `a[counter-1]` and `x` is not in `b[counter-1]`, causing the loop to break.
