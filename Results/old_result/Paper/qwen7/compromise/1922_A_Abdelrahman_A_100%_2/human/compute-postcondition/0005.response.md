Output State: **`tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0; `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user, `c` is an input string**.

The code assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `c`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0 is still valid.
