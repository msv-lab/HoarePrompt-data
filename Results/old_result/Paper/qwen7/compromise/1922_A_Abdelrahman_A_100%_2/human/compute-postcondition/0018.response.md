Postcondition: `no` is False, `tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0, `c` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `x` is the first character in the string `c`, counter is 0, and either `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, causing us to break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no other case to consider.
