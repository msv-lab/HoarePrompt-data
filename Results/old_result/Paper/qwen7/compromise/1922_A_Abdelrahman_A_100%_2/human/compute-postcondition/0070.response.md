Postcondition: `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the third character of `c`, `counter` is incremented by 1. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is also not in `b[counter]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `x` is in `a[counter]` or `x` is in `b[counter]`, the most internal loop or if statement continues without breaking.
