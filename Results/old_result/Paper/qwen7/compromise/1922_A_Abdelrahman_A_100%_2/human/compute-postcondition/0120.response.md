Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operations and returns different outputs based on the input values.**

Note: The specific operations and outputs are not detailed in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the structure and input nature of the function.
