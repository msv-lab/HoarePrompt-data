Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is a non-empty string.
- `x` is the first character of `c`.
- The character `x` is not in `a[counter]` and not in `b[counter]`.
- `no` is `False`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables (`c`, `x`, `a`, `b`, `counter`, and `no`). 

Output: **YES**
