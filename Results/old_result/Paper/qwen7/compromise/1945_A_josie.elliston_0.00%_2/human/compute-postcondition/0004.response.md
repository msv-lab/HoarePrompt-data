Postcondition: **`extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. If `extroverts` modulo 3 is not equal to 0 and `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` is greater than or equal to 3, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, no change is made to the values of `extroverts` and `universals`.**
