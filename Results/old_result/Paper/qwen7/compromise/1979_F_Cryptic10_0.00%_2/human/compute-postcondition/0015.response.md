Postcondition: `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `d` is n-1, `v` is either removed from `remaining_vertices` if `v` was initially in it, or remains unchanged if `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is no longer in `path` if it was added, and we either break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
