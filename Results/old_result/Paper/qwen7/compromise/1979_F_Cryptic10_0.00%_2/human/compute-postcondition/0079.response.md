Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, `d` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `v` equals 0, and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`; `path` now contains `v`.**

Explanation: The code removes the variable `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `v` was previously in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer there after the removal.
