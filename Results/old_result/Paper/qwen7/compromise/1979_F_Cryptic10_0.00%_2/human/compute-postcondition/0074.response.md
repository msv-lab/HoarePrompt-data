Output State: **`remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is 0, we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
