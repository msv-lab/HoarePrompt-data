Output State: **`d` is `n - 3`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended, and the value of `path` is updated.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is already the first return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, appending `v` to `path` simply adds `v` to the existing list. All other variables (`d`, `v`, `u`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The program continues the loop or iteration as the if condition `v == 0` does not change the postcondition when `v` is not 0.
