Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `d`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `d` is within the range specified by `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `d` starts from `n - 1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `d` is `n - 2`.
   - `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`.
   - `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`.
   - `path` now includes the value of `v` appended.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `d` was `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `d` should be decreased by 1. Therefore, `d` will be `n - 3`.

5. **Other States Remain Unchanged**: The other states (`v`, `remaining_vertices`, `u`, `path`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`d` is `n - 3`, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended**.
