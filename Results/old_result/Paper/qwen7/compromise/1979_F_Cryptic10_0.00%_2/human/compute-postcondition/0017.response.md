Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `d` is n-2, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is assigned by `func_1(d)`, and we either break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` assigns the return values of `func_1(d)` to `v` and `u`. Since `func_1(d)` is called with `d` which is `n-2`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` if it was initially in it, and `v` is no longer in `path` if it was added. The value of `d` remains `n-2`, and `u` is the second return value from `func_1(d)`. We also either break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
