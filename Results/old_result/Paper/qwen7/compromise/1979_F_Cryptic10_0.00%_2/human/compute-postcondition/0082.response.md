Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`.
- `d` remains 0.
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `v` equals 0.
- Either `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` or `path` now contains `v` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### For Loop:
```python
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head defines the variable `d` which iterates over the range from `n - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `d` is set to `0` (the last value it took in the previous iteration).

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `d` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `d` starts from `0` and decreases by `1` each iteration, the next value `d` can take is `-1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than `0`.
   - `v` remains `0`.
   - The condition for `remaining_vertices` and `path` remains the same as they are not directly affected by the loop.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`.
- `d` is `-1`.
- `n` is still greater than `0`.
- `v` equals `0`.
- Either `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` or `path` now contains `v` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Final Answer:
State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, `d` is `-1`, `n` is still greater than `0`, `v` equals `0`, and either `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` or `path` now contains `v` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
