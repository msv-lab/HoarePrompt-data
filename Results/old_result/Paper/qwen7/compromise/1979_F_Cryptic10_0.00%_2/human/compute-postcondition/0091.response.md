Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `d` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `d` in the range from `n-1` to `-1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore.
   - `d` is -1.
   - `n` is still greater than 0.
   - `path` now includes the value of `v`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - Since `d` is currently -1, the loop will not execute again because the loop starts from `n-1` and decrements down to 0. Once `d` reaches -1, it stops.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, there is no need to change the values of `d` or `n`.
   - The other variables (`remaining_vertices`, `path`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop has already completed its iterations.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, `d` is -1, `n` is still greater than 0, and `path` now includes the value of `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
