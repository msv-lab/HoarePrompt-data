Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, `d` is -1, `n` is still greater than 0, and `path` now includes the value of `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program breaks out of the current loop or conditional block.
