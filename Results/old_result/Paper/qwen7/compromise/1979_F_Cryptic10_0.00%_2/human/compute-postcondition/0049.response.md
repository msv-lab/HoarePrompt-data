Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `d`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `d` in the range from `n - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `d` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is `n - 1`.
   - `v` is either removed from `remaining_vertices` or remains unchanged.
   - `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`.
   - `path` either includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence or remains unchanged.
   - We either break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `d` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `d` will be `n - 2`.
   - The other variables (`v`, `u`, `path`) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified within the loop head.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop (if statement) remains the same unless the loop body modifies these conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`d` is `n - 2`, `v` is either removed from `remaining_vertices` or remains unchanged, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, and `path` either includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence or remains unchanged, and we either break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
