Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, `d` is -1, `v` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `u` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `n` is still greater than 0, and `path` now includes the value of `v`; `path` is updated by appending `v` to itself.**

Explanation: The line `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is already included in `path`, appending it again does not change the set of elements in `path`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
