The loop condition is `while remaining_vertices:`. This means the loop continues as long as there are elements in the `remaining_vertices` set.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to n that were never added to `path`.
- The variable `d` is now `-1`.
- The variable `path` contains a sequence of vertices added during each iteration where the condition `v in remaining_vertices` was met.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `remaining_vertices` is empty. If `remaining_vertices` is not empty, the loop can execute again. Since the loop has already executed for all possible iterations (from `d=n-1` down to `d=0`), `remaining_vertices` should be empty at this point.

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. Given that `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to n that were never added to `path`, we need to ensure that this set is non-empty.

State: **`remaining_vertices` must not be empty**
