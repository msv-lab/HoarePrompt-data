You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Kostyanych has chosen a complete undirected graph^{\dagger} with n vertices,
and then removed exactly (n - 2) edges from it. You can ask queries of the
following type:

  * "? d " — Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d . Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then "0\ 0 " is reported. 

Find a Hamiltonian path^{\ddagger} in the original graph in at most n queries.
It can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always
exists.

^{\dagger} A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly
one undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete
undirected graph with n vertices contains \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.

^{\ddagger} A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each
vertex exactly once.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Interaction

Interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer n .

Then you can make no more than n queries.

To make a query, output a line in the format "? d " (without quotes) (0 \le d
\le n - 1 ). After each query, read two integers — the answer to your query.

When you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format "! v_1\
v_2 \ldots v_n " (without quotes) — the vertices in the order of their
occurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as
one of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should
immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program
should be terminated immediately.

If your program makes more than n queries for one test case or makes an
incorrect query, then the response to the query will be -1 , and after
receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to
receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.

After outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the
output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit
exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

The interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the
interaction.

Hacks

To hack, use the following format:

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

Each of the following (n - 2) lines should contains two integers u and v (1
\le u, v \le n , u \ne v ) — ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.
Each edge must not occur more than once.

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^5 .

Note

In the first test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75d8c5328ccca8f82b69ba8300140bed4d40ce80.png)

Consider the queries:

  * There are no vertices with a degree of at least 3 in the graph, so "0\ 0 " is reported.
  * There are four vertices with a degree of at least 2 , and all of them have a degree of exactly 2 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Vertex 1 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 4 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 1 . After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * There are three vertices with a degree of at least 1 , among them vertices 2 and 3 have a minimum degree of 1 (vertex 4 has a degree of 2 ). Vertex 2 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 3 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 2 . After this, vertex 2 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the second test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/44d26c229eaff752c0a00c7160792daef41c7502.png)

Consider the queries:

  * Vertex 1 has a degree of at least 3 , but it is connected to all vertices, so "1\ 0 " is reported. After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * The remaining vertices 2 , 3 , and 4 have a degree of at least 0 , but among them vertex 4 has the minimum degree of 0 (vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1 ). Vertex 4 is not connected to both vertices 2 and 3 , so vertex 2 is reported (as it has the minimum number). After this, vertex 4 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the third test case, the graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge.

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    func_2(n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.

    v, u = map(int, input().split())
    return v, u
    #The program returns v and u, where v and u are input integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `d` within the range 0 to n-1 and reads two integers `v` and `u` from user input. It then returns these two integers `v` and `u`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
def func_2(n):
    path = []

    #State: Output State: `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, `d` is -1, `n` is less than or equal to 0, and `path` contains a sequence of vertices from the loop, ending with the last `u` value encountered before the loop terminates.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `remaining_vertices` will be empty because all possible vertices have been processed and added to `path`. The variable `d` will be -1 because the loop decrements `d` from `n-1` to 0 and then continues until `d` reaches -1. The variable `n` will still be less than or equal to 0 as per the given conditions, even though it might have been greater initially. The `path` will contain all the vertices that satisfied the condition `v in remaining_vertices` during the loop's execution, forming a sequence of vertices that were added to `path` before the loop terminated.
    print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
    #This is printed: !
    sys.stdout.flush()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \). It constructs a path by iterating through possible values and adding vertices to the path based on certain conditions. After processing all possible vertices, it prints the path as a sequence of vertices. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the path and ensures that all vertices are included in the path before terminating.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sends a query to the judge and returns the results.
   - It prints a query `? d` and waits for the judge to respond with two integers `(v, u)` representing the vertex with the minimum degree and the vertex it is not connected to, respectively.
   - If `v` is `0`, it means no such vertex exists, and the loop continues.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from `1` to `n`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until all vertices are processed (`remaining_vertices` is empty).
   - Inside the loop, it iterates over degrees `d` from `n-1` down to `0` to find the vertex with the minimum degree and the smallest number among those with the minimum degree.
   - If a suitable vertex `v` is found (i.e., `v` is in `remaining_vertices`), it adds `v` to the path and removes it from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Finally, it prints the path as a sequence of vertices.

### Correctness Check

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the interaction with the judge by printing the query and flushing the output buffer.
   - It correctly processes the response from the judge and returns the values `v` and `u`.

2. **Finding Hamiltonian Path**:
   - The function `func_2` uses a greedy approach to find the Hamiltonian path.
   - It starts from the highest degree and works downwards, ensuring that the vertex selected has the minimum degree and the smallest number among those with the minimum degree.
   - This approach ensures that we always pick the vertex with the lowest degree first, which helps in constructing a path that visits all vertices exactly once.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no suitable vertex is found by continuing the loop.
   - It ensures that the path is constructed by removing vertices and their edges, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should work correctly under the given constraints. The approach used in `func_2` is sound and should be able to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph within the allowed number of queries.
