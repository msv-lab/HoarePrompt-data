### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly prints a query in the format `? d`, where `d` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`.
   - It then flushes the output buffer to ensure the query is sent immediately.
   - It reads the response from the standard input and splits it into two integers `v` and `u`.
   - The function returns these two integers, which are the results of the query.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the queries defined in `func_1`.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path.
   - It uses a set `remaining_vertices` to keep track of the vertices that have not yet been included in the path.
   - The function iterates over possible degrees `d` from `n-1` down to 0.
     - For each degree `d`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` and its non-adjacent vertex `u`.
     - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
     - The loop continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty, ensuring all vertices are included in the path.
   - After the loop, the function prints the Hamiltonian path in the required format.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is sound. It correctly uses the queries to determine the structure of the graph and constructs a Hamiltonian path.
   - The loop in `func_2` ensures that all vertices are included in the path, and the use of `remaining_vertices` helps manage the vertices that need to be processed.
   - The flushing of the output buffer in both functions ensures that the queries and responses are handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the provided solution appears to be correct. The program correctly uses the queries to determine the structure of the graph and constructs a Hamiltonian path as required.

### Correctness:
**True**
