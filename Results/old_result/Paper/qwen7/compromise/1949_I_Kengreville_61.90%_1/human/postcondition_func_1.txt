The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from disk `i`. It marks all disks as visited and updates the `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` values for each disk `j` that is within the radius of disk `i` and has not been visited yet. After the function concludes, all disks will have been visited, and the `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` values will reflect the conditions under which they were updated during the DFS traversal.
