You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` and `dfs` functions do not properly handle the conditions necessary to determine if the radii can be adjusted as described.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `YES`. This happens because the program does not correctly check if the sum of the new radii can strictly decrease while maintaining tangency between disks.

Here's why the current implementation fails:
1. The `dfs` function only checks for tangency and updates coefficients based on the tangency condition. It does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases.
2. The logic to check if the sum of the new radii can decrease is missing. The program should calculate the new radii and verify if their sum is strictly less than the original sum while maintaining tangency.

A correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the new radii for each disk based on the tangency condition.
- Ensuring that the sum of the new radii is strictly less than the original sum.
- Verifying that no two disks overlap after the adjustment.

Since the current implementation does not handle these conditions correctly, it fails to produce the correct output for certain inputs, making the program incorrect.
