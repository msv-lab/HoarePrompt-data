Output State: **`j` is 1, `dx` is `y[i] - y[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`, `visited[j]` is False**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dx` to `x[i] - x[j]`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `dx` becomes `x[i] - x[1]`. However, since `dx` was initially defined as `x[i] - x[0]`, and `dy` was also defined as `y[i] - y[0]`, the new value of `dx` is updated to match the new expression, while `dy` remains unchanged. The values of `j` and `visited[j]` remain the same as the initial state.
