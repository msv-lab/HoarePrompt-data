Postcondition: **`j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` remains True, and either `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, or `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]` after the function `dfs(j)` is called if `visited[j]` is False and the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied, `visited[j]` remains False and no other changes occur.**
