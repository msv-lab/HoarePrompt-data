Output State: **`nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code `c1 += coef1[j]` iterates over each element `j` in the list `nodes` and adds the value of `coef1[j]` to `c1`. The initial state tells us that `c0` was increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`, but this does not affect the value of `c1`. The only change is that `c1` is now increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`. The list `nodes` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `c1` reflects the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.
