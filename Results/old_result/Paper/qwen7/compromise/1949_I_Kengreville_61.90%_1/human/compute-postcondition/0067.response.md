Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the object `nodes`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `j`: This variable will be assigned values from the `nodes` list during each iteration.
   - `nodes`: This is a list that will be iterated over.

3. **Analyze the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the `nodes` list must contain at least one element. If `nodes` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop requirements**:
   - Since the loop requires `nodes` to be non-empty, we need to ensure that `nodes` has at least one element.
   - The value of `j` will change with each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value because it will be assigned from `nodes`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `nodes` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`nodes` is an empty list (needs to have at least one element)**
