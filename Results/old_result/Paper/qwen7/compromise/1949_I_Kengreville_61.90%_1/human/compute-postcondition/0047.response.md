Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, but must contain at least one element; `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`.**

Explanation: The code `c0 += coef0[j]` increments the value of `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`. Since `nodes` is an empty list but must contain at least one element, its state remains unchanged. The value of `c0` is updated by adding `coef0[j]` to its current value.
