Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `ok` is True, `coef0[1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `c1 = 0` assigns the value 0 to `c1`. Since `c1` was previously defined as the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in the original `nodes` plus 1, and now it is explicitly set to 0, its new value is 0. The conditions for `ok` remain unchanged because `c1` is now 0, which does not affect the truth value of `ok` since `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
