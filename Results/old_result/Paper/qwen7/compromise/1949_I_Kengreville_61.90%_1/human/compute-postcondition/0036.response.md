Output State: **`nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ok = ok or c1 != 0` checks if `c1` is not equal to 0. If `c1` is not 0, then `ok` is set to True. If `c1` is 0, then `ok` remains unchanged. Since `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, the value of `ok` depends on whether this sum is 0 or not. The values of `nodes`, `c0`, and `c1` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
