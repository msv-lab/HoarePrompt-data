Output State: **`j` is 0; `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y[i] - y[j]` to the variable `dy`. Given the initial state where `j` is 0, `j` remains unchanged. The value of `dx` is also not affected by this line of code. Since `j` is 0, `dy` becomes `y[i] - y[0]`. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as stated above.
