Output State: **`j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is True, and either `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, or `visited[j]` remains False.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dx` to `x[i] - x[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
