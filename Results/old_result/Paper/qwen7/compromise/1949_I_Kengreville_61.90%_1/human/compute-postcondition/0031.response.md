Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter i, which is an integer. It returns nothing (None).**

This means the function `dfs(i)` accepts an integer `i` and does not return any value; it likely performs some operation related to the disks based on the index `i` provided, considering the constraints and lists provided for the disks' properties.
