Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `nodes` is an empty list. The code snippet updates `c0` by adding `coef0[j]` to it. Since no other variables are affected, the only change is that `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`.
