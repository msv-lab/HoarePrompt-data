Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be equal to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `nodes` will be an empty list since no nodes are visited.
- `c0` will be the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`. Since `nodes` is empty, `c0` will be 0.
- `c1` will be the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`. Since `nodes` is empty, `c1` will be 0.
- `ok` will be True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` will remain unchanged. Since `c1` is 0, `ok` will remain unchanged, meaning it will be True.

The print statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
