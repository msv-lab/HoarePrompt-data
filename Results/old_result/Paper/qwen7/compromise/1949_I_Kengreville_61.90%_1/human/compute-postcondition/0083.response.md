Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `nodes` will be a list that may contain elements based on the DFS calls but will be empty if no nodes are visited, `c0` will be the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` will be the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` will be True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` will remain unchanged. The condition `(ok)` is true.**
