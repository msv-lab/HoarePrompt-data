Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in the original `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in the original `nodes` plus 1, and `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged; `coef0[1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function is called with `i` as the argument. However, since the `dfs` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact changes it would make to the variables. Given the initial state, the only thing we can infer is that the value of `i` remains unchanged (still 1) because the `dfs` function does not modify `i`. All other variables remain in their initial states unless the `dfs` function explicitly modifies them, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the output state remains as described above.
