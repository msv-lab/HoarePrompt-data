Output State: **`j` is 1, `dx` is `y[i] - y[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is False**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dy` to `y[i] - y[j]`. Initially, `dy` was set to `y[i] - y[0]`. Now, since `j` is 1, `dy` becomes `y[i] - y[1]`. The values of `j`, `dx`, and `visited[j]` remain unchanged.
