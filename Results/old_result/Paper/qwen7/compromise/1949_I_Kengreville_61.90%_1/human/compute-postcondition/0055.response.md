Output State: `nodes` is a list containing at least three elements; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c0` and `c1` retain their values after all iterations of the loop, `ok` remains `True`, and `coef0[1]` remains `0`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `nodes` will contain at least as many elements as the number of times the loop ran (which is determined by the length of `nodes` initially and how many times it was appended during the loop). Both `c0` and `c1` will have accumulated the sum of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` respectively for each `j` in `nodes`. The conditions for `ok` and the value of `coef0[1]` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
