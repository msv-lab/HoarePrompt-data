Postcondition: **`stack` is either `[(1, 1), (new_node, 1), (node, x), (node, x)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, x), (node, x)]`, `x` is one of the neighbors of `1`, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices (must contain at least one element for key 1), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n - 1\), `visited` is a set containing `1`, `d` is a dictionary with key `(1)` and value `1`, `r` is 0, `node` is the next neighbor of `x`, and the stack does not change if `node` is not equal to `p`.**
