Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and inefficiencies:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `num`**: The variable `num` is intended to count the number of positions where either a rook can be placed directly or mirrored. However, the logic to calculate `num` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if c == r:` should only increment `num` by 1, not 2, because if `c == r`, the computer cannot mirror the move, and thus, only one rook can be placed in that position.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming approach used in the `dp` array is incorrect. The logic for updating the `dp` array assumes a linear sequence of moves, but the problem involves a more complex combinatorial scenario due to the mirroring and non-attacking constraints.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While the modulo operation is correctly applied to the final result, the intermediate calculations might still produce incorrect results due to the flawed logic in counting and updating the `dp` array.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Counting Valid Positions**: Calculate the number of valid positions left after the initial moves.
2. **Combinatorial Counting**: Use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the mirroring constraint.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            r, c = map(int, input().split())
            if r != c:
                num += 2
            else:
                num += 1
        m = n - num
        
        # Calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0] * (m + 1)
            dp[0] = 1
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % MOD
            print(dp[m])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the logic for counting valid positions and using dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations is accurate.
