Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the positions of the rooks placed so far. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Mirroring Logic**: For each rook placed, the program correctly checks if the rook is placed on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`). If it is, the number of non-mirrored rooks (`num`) is incremented by 1. Otherwise, it is incremented by 2. This logic is correct.

3. **Calculation of Remaining Spaces**: The number of remaining spaces `m` is calculated as `n - num`. This calculation is correct as it accounts for the spaces not occupied by any rooks, considering both mirrored and non-mirrored rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The base cases for dynamic programming are set correctly: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.

5. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transition formula used in the DP array is correct. It calculates the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining spaces, considering the constraints of the problem. Specifically, `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` correctly handles the placement of rooks in the remaining spaces.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case correctly, using the precomputed DP values.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
