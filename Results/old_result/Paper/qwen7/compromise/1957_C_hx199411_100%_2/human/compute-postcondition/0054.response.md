Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`, and `t` is `False`; `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, and `k` is assigned the value of the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
