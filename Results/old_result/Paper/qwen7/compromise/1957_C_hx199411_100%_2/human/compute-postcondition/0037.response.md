Output State: **`m` is `n - 2 * k`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`, `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`, `dp[1]` is set to `1`, `dp[2]` is set to `3`, and `m` is not equal to `1`.**

This means that the value of `dp[2]` has been updated to `3`, while all other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
