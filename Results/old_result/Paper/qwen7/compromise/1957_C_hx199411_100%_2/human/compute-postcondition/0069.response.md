Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `num` is 3, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2, making its new value 3 (since it was initially either 1 or 2). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
