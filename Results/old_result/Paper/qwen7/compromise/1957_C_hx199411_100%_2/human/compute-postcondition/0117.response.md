Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is equal to `num` + 1, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `i` is less than `k`.**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `m` remains as `n - num`, `i` remains as `k + 1`, and `num` becomes `num + 1`. The conditions and relationships involving `i` being less than `k` and `c` and `r` being the split integers from the input remain valid as well.
