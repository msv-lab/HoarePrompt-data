Postcondition: **`m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, and `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`. If `m` is 0, then `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times plus the additional value added during each iteration. Otherwise, if `m` is 1 and `i` equals `k`, or `m` is greater than or equal to `k - 2` and `i` is `k + 2`, `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements where `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and for each index `i` from `3` to `m`, `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7).**
