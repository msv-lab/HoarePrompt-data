Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `num` is either 1 or 2, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `c` and `r` respectively. The values of `m`, `i`, `k`, `num`, `t`, `i` (which is equal to `k`), `c` (first integer from the input), and `r` (second integer from the input) are updated. The conditions that `k` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0 remain unchanged.
