Postcondition: `m` is `n - 2 * k`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, and `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`. Moreover, `m` is not equal to `1`.
