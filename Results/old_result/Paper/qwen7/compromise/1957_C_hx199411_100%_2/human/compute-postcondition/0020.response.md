Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `num` is `c` + 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is `c` + 2**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `c` and `r` respectively. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `num` is determined based on the condition: if `c` equals `r`, then `num` is `c` + 1, otherwise `num` is `c` + 2.
