Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `c` is equal to `r`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and were not affected by the code snippet.
