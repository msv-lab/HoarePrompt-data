Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is 0.
- `i` is equal to `k`, where `k` is an input integer.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration.
- `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
