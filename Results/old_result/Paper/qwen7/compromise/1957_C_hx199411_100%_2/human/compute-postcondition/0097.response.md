Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length `m + 1` where each element `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for all `i` from 3 to `m`. The initial conditions are `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and all other elements are initially set to 0. After executing the loop for all iterations, the `dp` list will contain the computed values for each index from 1 to `m`.

This means that the `dp` list will have been updated according to the given recurrence relation for all indices from 3 up to and including `m`, with all calculations performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
