Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered as input, `r` is the second integer entered as input, `num` is 0, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts using space as the delimiter, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `c` and `r`. The values of `m`, `i`, `k`, `num`, `t`, `k` (must be greater than 0), and `i` (must be 0) remain unchanged from their initial states.
