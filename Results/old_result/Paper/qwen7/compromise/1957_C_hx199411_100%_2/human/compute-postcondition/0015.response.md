Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is `c` + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1. Since `c` was an integer from the input, `num` now holds the value of `c + 1`. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged.
