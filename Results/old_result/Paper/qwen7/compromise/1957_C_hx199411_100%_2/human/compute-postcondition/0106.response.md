State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is 0, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `i` must be less than `k`**

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `i`.
- The loop condition `i in range(k)` means that the loop will execute as long as `i < k`.
- Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be less than `k`.

All other variables (`m`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `t`, `n`, `k`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
