Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4; n and k retain their original values, and r_i and c_i remain undefined.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `r_i` and `c_i` are not defined in the given code snippet. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is now updated to reflect the new value of `t` as input from the user.
