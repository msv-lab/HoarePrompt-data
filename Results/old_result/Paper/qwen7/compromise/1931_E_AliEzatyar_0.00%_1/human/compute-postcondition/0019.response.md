Output State: The value of `counter` will be equal to the number of consecutive '0's from the end of the list `num`. If `num` does not contain any '0' from the end, `counter` will be 0. If `num` ends with multiple '0's, `counter` will count all of them.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `counter` will hold the total count of '0's starting from the last element of `num` and moving backwards until a non-'0' element is encountered or the entire list is traversed.
