Output State: **`counter` is 0, `num` has at least one element, `i` is len(num) - 1, and num[i] is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `counter`, `num`, `i`, and the condition on `num[i]`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in.
