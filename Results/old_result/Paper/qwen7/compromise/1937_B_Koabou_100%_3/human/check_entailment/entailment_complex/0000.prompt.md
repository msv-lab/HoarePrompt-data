Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are given, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1; list `a` contains two elements which are the inputs provided by the user; `n` is an input integer.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes, `s` will contain either `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` if the first condition is met for any `i`, or `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` if neither condition is met for any `i`. The variable `x` will be set to `i` if the first condition is met, otherwise it will be set to `n - 1`. The variable `y` will be set to `i` if the second condition is met, otherwise it will remain 0.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `y` to `x`. During each iteration, it checks if a substring of `a[1]` matches a corresponding substring of `s`. If a match is found, it sets `t` to the length of the matching substring and breaks out of the loop. Since the initial states of `t`, `n`, `s`, `x`, and `y` are not changed outside the loop, their final values will be determined by the loop's execution. However, without specific values for `a`, `x`, and `y`, we can only say that `t` will be set to the length of the matching substring if a match is found, otherwise it will retain its initial value of 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1 or the length of the matching substring (depending on whether a match is found during the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `s` based on certain conditions involving characters from `a_1` and `a_2`. It then determines the length of the longest matching substring between `s` and a portion of `a_2`, starting from index `y` to `x`. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the length of the matching substring (which could be 1 or the length of the matching substring if one is found).
