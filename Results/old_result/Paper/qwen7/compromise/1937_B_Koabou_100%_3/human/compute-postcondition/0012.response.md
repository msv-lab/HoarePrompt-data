Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(y, x)`.
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The range function is defined by two parameters: `y` (start) and `x` (stop).

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the range function `range(y, x)` must produce at least one value. This means `y` must be less than `x`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `y` is less than `x` for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `y` and `x` such that `y < x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `y` must be less than `x`**
