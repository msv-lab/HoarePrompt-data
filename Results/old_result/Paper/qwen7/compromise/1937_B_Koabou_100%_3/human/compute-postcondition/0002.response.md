State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1, list `a` is an empty list, `_` is not used in the loop, and the loop will run exactly 2 times.**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable in the for loop is `_`, which is a placeholder typically used when the loop variable is not needed inside the loop body. This means the value of `_` itself does not change within the loop, but the loop will still execute twice as specified by `range(2)`.

2. The loop body is omitted, so no internal state changes are considered here.

3. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and the binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are already given and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

4. The list `a` is initially empty and remains unchanged during the loop execution based on the given information.

5. The loop will run exactly 2 times because of `range(2)`, so no additional state adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute correctly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be explicitly mentioned is that the loop will run exactly 2 times.
