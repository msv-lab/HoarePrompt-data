Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer.**

Explanation: The given code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `t`. No other changes are made to the other variables (`n`, `s`, `x`, `y`). Therefore, the values of `n`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
