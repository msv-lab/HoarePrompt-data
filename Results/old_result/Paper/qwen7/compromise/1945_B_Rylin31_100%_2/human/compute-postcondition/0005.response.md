Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the value of \(m // a + m // b + 2\) and prints the result. The function reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input first, then iterates through each test case, performing the calculation and outputting the result. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the specified output state.**
