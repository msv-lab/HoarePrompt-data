Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. This means the loop will execute as long as the user inputs a non-zero integer.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). However, the loop itself does not depend directly on `t`. Instead, the loop relies on the input from the user.

4. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute, the user must provide a non-zero integer as input. Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input will trigger the loop.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be read by `int(input())`. Specifically, the input should be a non-zero integer.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- The input provided to `int(input())` must be a non-zero integer

Since the loop condition depends on the input, and not on `t`, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), the input provided to `int(input())` must be a non-zero integer**
