Output State: `pergunta` is a string, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n`, the length of `pergunta` is `n`; `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` in the range from `n-1` to `n-m`, and `pergunta` is updated in each iteration to be the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[i]` for `i` in the range from `n-1` to `m-1`.
