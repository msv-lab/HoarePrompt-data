Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed version of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`**

The code assigns the first character of the string `num` to the variable `symb1`. Since `num` is a string, `num[0]` refers to its first character. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
