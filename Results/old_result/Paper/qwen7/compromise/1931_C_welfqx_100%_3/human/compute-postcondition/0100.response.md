Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` remains 1, `onum` is a copy of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum = num.copy()` creates a copy of the variable `num` and assigns it to `onum`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `j` and `f` remain unchanged, and `onum` now holds the same value as `num`.
