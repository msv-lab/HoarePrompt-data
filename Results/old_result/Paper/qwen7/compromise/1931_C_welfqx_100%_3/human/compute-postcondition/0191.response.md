Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `n-2`
   - `f` is 1
   - `onum` is the reverse of `num`
   - `ck` is 1
   - `symb1` is `num[0]`
   - `symb2` is `onum[0]`
   - If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive).

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the value it had during the last execution of the loop.
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `j` is set to `n-2` initially and does not change within the loop.
   - `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` are not modified within the loop based on the given information.

6. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n-1`.

Given these points, let's determine the new state for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if the previous value of `i` was `k`, the next value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
- All other variables (`j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) remain unchanged.

Since the exact previous value of `i` is not specified, we can denote it as `k`. Thus, the next value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `j` remains `n-2`
- `f` remains 1
- `onum` remains the reverse of `num`
- `ck` remains 1
- `symb1` remains `num[0]`
- `symb2` remains `onum[0]`
- `i` will be `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

However, since the exact previous value of `i` is not provided, we can generalize the state as follows:

**State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `i` is `i + 1` where `i` was `n-2` at the end of the previous iteration.**
