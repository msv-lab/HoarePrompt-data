Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`).

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num[j]` and `num[j + 1]` are elements of the list `num`.
   - If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, the loop breaks.
   - If `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`, the loop continues.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`, we need to determine the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`num[j + 1]` and `num[j + 2]` are elements of the list `num`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`**.
