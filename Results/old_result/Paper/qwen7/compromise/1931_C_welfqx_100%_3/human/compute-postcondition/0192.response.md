Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `cn` is `cn + 1`.**

The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Since `cn` was not specified with an initial value in the initial state, we assume it is incremented by 1 from whatever its previous value was. All other variables remain unchanged.
