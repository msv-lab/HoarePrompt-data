Output State: **`cn` is 1, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `cn` is incremented by 1, starting from an implied initial value of 0 (since it's not specified otherwise). The value of `i` remains 3, and the condition for `n` to remain the same unless the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal does not apply here because the index `i + 1` (which is 4) is not mentioned in the initial state and no list or array context is given. Therefore, `n` remains greater than 0.
