Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `r` and the variable `t`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `r` is less than `t`. Therefore, the initial value of `r` should be 0 (since it starts from 0) and `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and we know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` is within this range and `r` starts at 0.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `r` is 0

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0**
