Output State: **`j` is `n-2` and `f` is 1, `onum` is a copy of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum = num.copy()` creates a copy of the variable `num` and assigns it to `onum`. The values of `j` and `f` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `j` is still `n-2` and `f` is still 1. The initial state's conditions about `j` and `f` are still valid, and now `onum` holds a copy of the original `num`.
