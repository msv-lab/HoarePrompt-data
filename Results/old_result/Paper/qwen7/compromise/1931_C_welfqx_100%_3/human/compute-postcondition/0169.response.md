Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `n-2`, `f` is 0, and `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be set to `n-2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive). The condition `if num[j] != num[j + 1]: f = 0; break` ensures that once this condition is met, the loop breaks, setting `f` to `0`. Since the loop iterates through the entire list `num` until it finds a pair of consecutive elements that are not equal or reaches the end of the list, `f` will be `0` by the end of the loop. All other variables' states remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
