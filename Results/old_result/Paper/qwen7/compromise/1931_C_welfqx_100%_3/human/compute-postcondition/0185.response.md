Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `cn` is increased by 1.**

The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `j` remains `n-2`, `f` remains 1, `onum` remains the reverse of `num`, `ck` remains 1, `symb1` remains `num[0]`, and `symb2` remains `onum[0]`. The only change is that `cn` has been incremented by 1.
