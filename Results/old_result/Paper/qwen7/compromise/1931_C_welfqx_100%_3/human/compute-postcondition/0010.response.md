Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is 0, and if the elements at indices `j` and `j+1` in the list `num` are not equal, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
