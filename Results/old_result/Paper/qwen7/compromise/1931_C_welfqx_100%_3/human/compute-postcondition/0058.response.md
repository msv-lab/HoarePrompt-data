Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ii` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times.
   - `cn` is 0.
   - `num` is a list.
   - If `onum[0]` is equal to `onum[1]`, then `ck` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `ii = 0` to `ii < n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, making it `ii = 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ii` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `cn` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `num` remains a list as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The condition for `ck` remains the same since it is determined based on the values of `onum[0]` and `onum[1]`, which are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `ii` is 1, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times, `cn` is 0, and `num` is a list.**
