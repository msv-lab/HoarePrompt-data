Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (since `range(n - 1)` starts from 0).
   - `n` is the length of the range, which is `n - 1`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n - 1)` will not generate any values if `n - 1` is less than 0.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
