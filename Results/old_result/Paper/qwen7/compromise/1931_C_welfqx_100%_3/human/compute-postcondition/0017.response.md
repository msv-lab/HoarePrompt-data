Output State: **`f` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement that `j` was involved in. The values of `f`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `j + 1` still holds true.
