Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is `n - 1`, and `n` is the original length of the list `num`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `f` will be 0 if any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different (causing the loop to break), otherwise `f` remains 1. The variable `j` will be `n - 1` because the loop runs from `j` in the range `0` to `n - 2`. The other variables (`t`, `r`, and `num`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
