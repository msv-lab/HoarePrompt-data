Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `ii` and the value `n - 1`. Therefore, the variables that need to be adjusted are `ii` and `n`.

2. **Determine the New Value of `ii`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 1. Since the loop increments `ii` by 1 each time it runs, the new value of `ii` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `ii` is less than `n - 1`. Given that `ii` is now 2, the condition `ii < n - 1` will be true only if `n - 1 > 2`, which means `n > 3`.

4. **Adjust the Other States**: The other states (`cn`, `num`, and the postcondition related to `onum[ii]` and `onum[ii + 1]`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times and `n > 3`, `cn` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, and `num` is a list.**
