### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   
2. **Conditions Check**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is met, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c`. This is done using the condition `max(a, b, c) == b`. However, this condition alone is not sufficient because it does not account for the possibility that `a` could be equal to `b` or `c` while still forming a peak.
   - **Equal Digits**: The program correctly handles the case where all three digits are equal (`a == b == c`) and prints 'NONE'.
   - **Other Cases**: For any other combination, the program prints 'NONE'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program fails to handle the case where `a > b < c` which should also be considered a peak.
   - The current implementation incorrectly classifies `a > b < c` as 'NONE' instead of 'PEAK'.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis above, the program does not fully cover all conditions for a peak. Specifically, it misses the case where `a > b < c`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you need to adjust the peak condition check to properly handle the case where `a > b < c`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a > b < c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This will ensure that all conditions for a peak are correctly identified.
