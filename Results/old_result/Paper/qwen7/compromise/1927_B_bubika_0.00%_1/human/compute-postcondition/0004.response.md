Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 â‰¤ a_i < n, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `s`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
