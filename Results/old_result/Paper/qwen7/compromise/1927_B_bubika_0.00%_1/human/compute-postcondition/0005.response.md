Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 â‰¤ a_i < n, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `r` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `r` as an empty string. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
