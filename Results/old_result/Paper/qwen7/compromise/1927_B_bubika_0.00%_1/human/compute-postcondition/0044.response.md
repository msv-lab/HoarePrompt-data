Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list of integers; `x` is the index of `i` in list `s`.**

The code `x = s.index(i)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of `i` in the list `s` to the variable `x`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify a numerical value for `x`. However, we know that `x` will be an integer representing the position of `i` in the list `s`. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged.
