Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s`. The only object involved here is `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `i` is the variable that will take each element from the list `s` one by one during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `s` must contain at least one element. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, we need to ensure that `s` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will change during each iteration of the loop but initially, it doesn't matter what its value is because the loop will start with the first element of `s`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the list `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers that must have at least one element**
