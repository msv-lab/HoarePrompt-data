Output State: **`r` is increased by the value at index `x` in list `s`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the index of `i` in list `s`.**

This means that the value of `r` has been incremented by the element in the list `s` at the index specified by `x`. The list `s` and the index `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
