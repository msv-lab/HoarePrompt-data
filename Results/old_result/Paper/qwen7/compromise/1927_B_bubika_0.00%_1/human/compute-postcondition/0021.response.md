Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `r` will be the sum of the elements in list `a` at the indices specified by the elements in list `s`, `b` will contain the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s`, `t` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `r`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is now an input integer, while `r`, `b`, and `t` retain their original descriptions.
