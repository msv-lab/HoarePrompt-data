Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i`: This is the variable that will take on each value from the list `s` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `s`: This is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `s` must contain at least one element. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `s` is a list of integers, we need to ensure that `s` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will change during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its exact value initially because the loop will assign values to `i` as it iterates through `s`.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - The other variables (`t`, `r`, `a`, `b`, and `n`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty list of integers**.
