Output State: **`cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the value `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since the initial values of `cnt` and `a[i]` are not specified, we can only say that the count of `a[i]` in `cnt` has been incremented by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
