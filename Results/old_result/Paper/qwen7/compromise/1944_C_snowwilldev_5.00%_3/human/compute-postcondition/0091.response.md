Output State: The value of `t` remains \(N + 3\), the value of `i` becomes \(6 + N + N\), `a` remains as the original list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key (an element from the list `a`) has its corresponding value incremented by 1 for each occurrence of that key in the list `a` up to the \(N\)th element.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` stays the same, `i` is now \(6 + 2N\), and `cnt` contains the count of each element in the list `a` up to the \(N\)th element.
