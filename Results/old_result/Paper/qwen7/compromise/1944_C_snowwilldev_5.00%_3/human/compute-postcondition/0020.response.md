Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `N` is greater than 0, and the condition `t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` is true. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `i`, or `N`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. The condition `t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` remains unchanged.
