Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 8, `N` must be greater than 7, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, `cnt[a[6]]` is 3**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Given that `i` is 8, the code becomes `cnt[a[8]] += 1`. Since `cnt[a[6]]` was previously 2, and assuming no other modifications to `a[8]` before this line, the new value of `cnt[a[8]]` (or `cnt[a[6]]` if `a[8] == a[6]`) would be 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
