Output State: **`t` is 4, `i` is 6 + N, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, and the current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`i`, `N`, `a`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
