Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 2
- `i` is 4
- `N` is greater than 0
- If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` would change to 1, `i` would change to 4, and `N` would remain greater than 0. However, since no information about `cnt[i]` is given, we assume it does not equal 1 (as no changes to `t`, `i`, or `N` are mentioned).

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is 4, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **4**
