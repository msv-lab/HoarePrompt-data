Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `N` is `N`, `cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1, and `t` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, the values of `i`, `N`, `cnt[i]`, and `t` remain unchanged.
