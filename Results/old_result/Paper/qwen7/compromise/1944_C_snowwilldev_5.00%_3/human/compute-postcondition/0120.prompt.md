Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The value of `t` remains \(N + 3\), the value of `i` is \(9 + N\), `a` remains as the original list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key (an element from the list `a`) has its corresponding value incremented by 3, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cnt[i]` is either 0 or equal to 1, and `t` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1, and `t` is increased by 1, making it `t + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `N` remains unchanged, `cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1, and `t` is 1. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
