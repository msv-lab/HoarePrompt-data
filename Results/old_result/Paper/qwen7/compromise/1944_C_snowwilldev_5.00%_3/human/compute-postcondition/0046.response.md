Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is 3
   - `i` is 6
   - `N` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0
   - `cnt[a[6]]` is 1

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 6, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 7 (assuming `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).
   - `N` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains 3.
   - `i` changes to 7.
   - `N` remains greater than 0.
   - `a` remains the same list of integers.
   - `cnt` remains the same defaultdict with all values initialized to 0.
   - `cnt[a[6]]` remains 1 because the value of `a[6]` does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 7, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, `cnt[a[6]]` is 1**
