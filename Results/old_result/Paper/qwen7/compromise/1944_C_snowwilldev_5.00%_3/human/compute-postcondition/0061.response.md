Output: **6 + N (where N is a positive integer)**

Explanation:
- `t` is explicitly given as 4, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is defined as `6 + N`, where `N` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- Since `N` is greater than 0, `i` will be a number greater than 6.
- The print statement `print(i)` will output the value of `i`, which is `6 + N`.

Therefore, the output will be `6 + N`, where `N` is a positive integer.
