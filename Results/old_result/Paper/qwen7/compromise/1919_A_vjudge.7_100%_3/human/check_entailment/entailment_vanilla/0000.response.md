### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them, but after any move, they must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If a player has more than one coin, they can always force the opponent into a losing position by swapping wallets and removing a coin, ensuring the opponent is left with a smaller number of coins.
   - The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner:
     - If `a + b` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he wins.
     - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have respectively.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `if a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the sum of coins is even or odd and assigns the winner based on this condition.
   - This matches the optimal strategy explained above.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
