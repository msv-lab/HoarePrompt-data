Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `test` is an input integer.**

The code `test = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `test`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
