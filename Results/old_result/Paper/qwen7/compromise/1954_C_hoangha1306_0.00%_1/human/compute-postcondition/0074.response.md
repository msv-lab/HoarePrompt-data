Output State: **`a` is an input string, `kq1` is '', `kq2` is a string containing the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `a` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and for the cases where `a[i] != b[i]`, `kq2` will contain the string representation of the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` if `vt == 0` and `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise it will contain the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is set to 1 or will not be equal to 0, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `q` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `b` is an input string**.

Explanation: The line `kq1 = ''` sets the variable `kq1` to an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
