Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is updated based on the comparison of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` (either concatenating the string representation of the maximum value to the original `kq1` or setting it to 'None+x'), `kq2` is updated similarly (concatenating the string representation of the minimum value to the original `kq2` or setting it to an empty string plus the string representation of `y`), `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.
