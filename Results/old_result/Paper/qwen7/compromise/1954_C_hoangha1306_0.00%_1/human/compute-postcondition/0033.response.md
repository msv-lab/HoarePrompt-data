Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `x` and `y` based on the comparison of elements at each index, `kq2` is a string that either contains the value of `x` or is concatenated with the string representation of `x` and `y` based on the comparison of elements at each index, and `vt` is either set to 1 or is not equal to 0.
