Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of `kq1` and `str(y)`, and `kq2` is a string that either contains the concatenation of `kq2` and `str(x)` (if `a[i] <= b[i]` for all indices `i`) or contains the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x` plus the string representation of `y` (if `a[i] > b[i]` for some index `i`). Additionally, `vt` is either 1 or not equal to 0.
