Output State: **`vt` is 1, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with `str(x)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` concatenates the string representation of `x` to the existing value of `kq2`. The initial state of `vt` and `kq1` remains unchanged, while `kq2` gets updated by appending `str(x)` to its current value.
