Output State: **`x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `x`, `a`, or `kq2` within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The `kq2` expression remains as it was before, indicating that the addition operation was intended but not executed due to the `continue`.
