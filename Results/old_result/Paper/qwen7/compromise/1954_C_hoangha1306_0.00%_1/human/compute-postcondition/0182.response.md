Output State: **`vt` is 1, `kq1` is 'None+x'**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `vt` is 1. The code snippet attempts to add `str(x)` to `kq1`. However, `kq1` is not defined before this line of code, which would normally raise a `NameError`. Assuming `kq1` was intended to be initialized to `None` (a common practice when a variable is to be built up through concatenation), the operation `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)` would result in `kq1` being set to `'None+x'`. Since `x` is not specified, it remains as part of the string. The value of `vt` remains unchanged.
