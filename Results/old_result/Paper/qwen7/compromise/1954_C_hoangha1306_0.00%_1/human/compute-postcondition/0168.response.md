Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
