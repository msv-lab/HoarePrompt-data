Output State: **`vt` is 1, `kq1` is 'None' + str(x)**

Explanation: The initial state of `vt` is 1. The line of code `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)` attempts to concatenate `str(x)` to `kq1`. However, `kq1` is not defined before this line, so it defaults to `None`. Therefore, `kq1` becomes `'None' + str(x)`. The value of `vt` remains unchanged.
