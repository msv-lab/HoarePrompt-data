Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `a[i]` and the previous value of `kq1`, `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representation of `a[i]` with its previous value if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise it is updated by appending the string representation of `y` (which is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`) to its current value, `vt` is either set to 1 or is not equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1` where `n` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
