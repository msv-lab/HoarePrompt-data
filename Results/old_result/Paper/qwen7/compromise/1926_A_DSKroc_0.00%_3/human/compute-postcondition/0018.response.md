Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second character in the string `s`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is now the second character, the next character in the string `s` will be accessed in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be set to the third character in the string `s`.

4. **Maintain other relevant states**:
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `q` must still be 0.
   - `ac` remains 1.
   - `bc` remains either 1 or 2.
   - `s` remains the same non-empty input string.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` must be 0, `ac` is 1, `bc` is either 1 or 2, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the third character in the string `s`**
