Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string.
3. After counting, it prints the character ('A' or 'B') that appears more frequently in the current test case.
4. The logic inside the loop is correct: it increments `ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B'.
5. The if-else statement correctly determines which character appears more frequently and prints it.
6. There are no logical errors in the provided code that would cause incorrect results based on the problem description and the provided example.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
