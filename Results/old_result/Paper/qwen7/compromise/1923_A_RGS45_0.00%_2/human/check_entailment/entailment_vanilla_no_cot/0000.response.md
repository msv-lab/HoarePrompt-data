Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads input as strings and uses `str.find` and `str[::-1].find` to locate the positions of the first and last chips. However, it then constructs a substring `z` and counts the zeros in it, which does not reflect the correct logic needed to solve the problem.

2. **Logic Error**: The goal is to move chips to form a single block with no free cells between them. Counting zeros in a substring does not help achieve this. Instead, we need to calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program does not account for the fact that chips must be moved to the closest free cell to the left. It also does not handle cases where multiple chips need to be moved to form a single block.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chips = [i for i, x in enumerate(arr) if x == 1]
        min_moves = float('inf')
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of moves to bring all chips together
        for i in range(len(chips)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(chips)):
                moves = max(chips[i] - chips[0], chips[j] - chips[0])
                min_moves = min(min_moves, moves)
        
        print(min_moves)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a single block.
