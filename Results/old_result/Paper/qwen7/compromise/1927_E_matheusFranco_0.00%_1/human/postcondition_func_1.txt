The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even), calls another function `func_1()` to perform some operations, and then decrements the counter `t`. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is less than or equal to 0.
