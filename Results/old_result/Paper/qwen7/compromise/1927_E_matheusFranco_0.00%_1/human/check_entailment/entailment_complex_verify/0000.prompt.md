You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1

            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `k * (n // k) * k`, which simplifies to `n * k`, since `n` is the total number of iterations and `k` is the step size. `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will be `curr_v + (n // k)`, where `n // k` is the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will retain its initial value of `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to `n`, the total number of iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `n * k`, which is the product of the total number of iterations and the step size `k`. The value stored in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `curr_v` plus the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will still be `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to the total number of iterations `n`.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: n + (n // k) [followed by the rest of the elements in the permutation list from index n * k to the end]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input, where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even. It then constructs a list `permutation` of length \( n \) and fills it according to a specific pattern. Specifically, for each iteration from \( 0 \) to \( k-1 \), it places values starting from \( 1 \) up to \( n \) in the list at positions that are multiples of \( k \) plus the current iteration index. After completing these iterations, it prints the contents of the `permutation` list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is less than or equal to 0.
    #
    #This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be less than or equal to 0. This is because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Once `t` becomes 0 or less, the condition `t > 0` in the loop head will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even), calls another function `func_1()` to perform some operations, and then decrements the counter `t`. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is less than or equal to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a k-level permutation for all possible inputs. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, a valid k-level permutation should satisfy the condition that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` is at most 1.

The current implementation generates the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4]` for `n = 4` and `k = 2`. Let's check the sums of continuous segments of length `k`:

- Sum of the first segment: `1 + 2 = 3`
- Sum of the second segment: `2 + 3 = 5`
- Sum of the third segment: `3 + 4 = 7`

The maximum sum is 7 and the minimum sum is 3, so the difference is `7 - 3 = 4`, which violates the k-level condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for generating a k-level permutation for all potential cases.
