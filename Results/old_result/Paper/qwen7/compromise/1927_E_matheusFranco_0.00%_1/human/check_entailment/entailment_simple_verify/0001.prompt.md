You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `k * (n // k) * k`, which simplifies to `n * k`, since `n` is the total number of iterations and `k` is the step size. `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will be `curr_v + (n // k)`, where `n // k` is the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will retain its initial value of `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to `n`, the total number of iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `n * k`, which is the product of the total number of iterations and the step size `k`. The value stored in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `curr_v` plus the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will still be `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to the total number of iterations `n`.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: n + (n // k) [followed by the rest of the elements in the permutation list from index n * k to the end]

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is less than or equal to 0.
    #
    #This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be less than or equal to 0. This is because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Once `t` becomes 0 or less, the condition `t > 0` in the loop head will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function `func_1()` constructs a permutation of length `n`.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of zeros with length `n`.
   - It uses a variable `idx` to keep track of the current index in the permutation.
   - It uses `idx_v` to keep track of the value to be assigned at the current index.
   - It iterates over the range `k` times, assigning values in a specific pattern:
     - For each `i` in the range `k`, it starts assigning values from index `i` and increments by `k` each time.
     - The value being assigned increases by 1 each time it is placed in the permutation.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

### Verification of Correctness

To verify if this approach generates a k-level permutation, let's consider the construction logic:

- The program assigns values in a way that ensures every `k`-length segment will have unique starting points, but it doesn't ensure that the sums of these segments will differ by no more than 1.

- Specifically, the assignment pattern:
  - Assigns values in blocks of size `k` starting from different indices.
  - Ensures that each block has a unique starting point but does not control the sum differences directly.

- To check if the constructed permutation is k-level, we need to ensure that the sums of any two consecutive segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. However, the given implementation does not inherently guarantee this property.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's manually construct and check a few examples to see if the program works as intended:

#### Example 1: \( n = 2, k = 2 \)
- Permutation: `[1, 2]`
- Sums: \( [1+2] = [3] \)
- Difference: \( \max(3) - \min(3) = 0 \leq 1 \) (Correct)

#### Example 2: \( n = 3, k = 2 \)
- Permutation: `[1, 3, 2]`
- Sums: \( [1+3], [3+2] = [4, 5] \)
- Difference: \( \max(5) - \min(4) = 1 \leq 1 \) (Correct)

#### Example 3: \( n = 10, k = 4 \)
- Permutation: `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`
- Sums: \( [1+8+4+10], [8+4+10+2], [4+10+2+7], [10+2+7+5], [2+7+5+9], [7+5+9+3], [5+9+3+6] \)
- Sums: \( [23], [25], [23], [24], [24], [24], [26] \)
- Differences: \( \max(26) - \min(23) = 3 \) (Incorrect)

From the above analysis, we can see that the program does not always generate a k-level permutation because it does not control the sums of the segments effectively.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
