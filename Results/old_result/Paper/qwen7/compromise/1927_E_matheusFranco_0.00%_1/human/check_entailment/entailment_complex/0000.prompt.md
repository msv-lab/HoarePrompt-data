Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0

    curr_v = 1

            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `k * (n // k) * k`, which simplifies to `n * k`, since `n` is the total number of iterations and `k` is the step size. `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will be `curr_v + (n // k)`, where `n // k` is the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will retain its initial value of `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to `n`, the total number of iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `n * k`, which is the product of the total number of iterations and the step size `k`. The value stored in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `curr_v` plus the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will still be `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to the total number of iterations `n`.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: n + (n // k) [followed by the rest of the elements in the permutation list from index n * k to the end]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input, where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even. It then constructs a list `permutation` of length \( n \) and fills it according to a specific pattern. Specifically, for each iteration from \( 0 \) to \( k-1 \), it places values starting from \( 1 \) up to \( n \) in the list at positions that are multiples of \( k \) plus the current iteration index. After completing these iterations, it prints the contents of the `permutation` list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is less than or equal to 0.
    #
    #This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be less than or equal to 0. This is because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Once `t` becomes 0 or less, the condition `t > 0` in the loop head will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even), calls another function `func_1()` to perform some operations, and then decrements the counter `t`. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is less than or equal to 0.
