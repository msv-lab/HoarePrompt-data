Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 2`, and `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given that initially `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was equal to `i`, after executing this line, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `i + k`. The values of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`, `curr_v`, and `i` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
