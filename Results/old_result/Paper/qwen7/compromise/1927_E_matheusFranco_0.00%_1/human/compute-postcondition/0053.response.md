Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `k * (n // k) * k`, which simplifies to `n * k`, since `n` is the total number of iterations and `k` is the step size. `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will be `curr_v + (n // k)`, where `n // k` is the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will retain its initial value of `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to `n`, the total number of iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `n * k`, which is the product of the total number of iterations and the step size `k`. The value stored in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `curr_v` plus the total number of iterations divided by `k`. The variable `i` will still be `0`, and `curr_v` will be equal to the total number of iterations `n`.
