Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 3k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3` plus 1, and `i` is incremented by 1 and less than `len(permutation)`**.

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Initially, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was `i + 2k`. After adding `k`, it becomes `i + 3k`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
