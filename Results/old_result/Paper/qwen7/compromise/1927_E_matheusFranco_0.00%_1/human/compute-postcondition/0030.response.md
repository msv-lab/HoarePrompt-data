Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`.
  - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1 + 1`.
  - `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`.
  - `i` is less than `len(permutation)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 2`.
   - `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + (i + 3)`.
   - `i` is less than `len(permutation)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` must still hold true.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and it must remain less than `len(permutation)`, we need to ensure that `i + 2k < len(permutation)`.
   - The current value of `i` is less than `len(permutation)`, so to ensure the loop executes again, `i` should be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body increments `i` by 1).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is incremented by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains valid.

### Final State:
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 2`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`, and `i` is less than `len(permutation)` but incremented by 1**.

However, since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 2`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`, and `i` is less than `len(permutation)` but incremented by 1**.

In a more concise form:

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 2`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`, and `i` is incremented by 1 and less than `len(permutation)`**.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 2`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`, and `i` is incremented by 1 and less than `len(permutation)`**.
