Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `k * (n // k) * k`, which simplifies to `n * k`. This is because the loop runs `n // k` times, and in each iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k` starting from `i`. Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop runs `n // k` times, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will reach `n * k`.

`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will be `curr_v + (n // k)`, where `n // k` is the total number of iterations the loop ran.

The variable `i` will retain its initial value of 0 after the loop completes, as it is not modified within the loop.

The variable `curr_v` will be equal to the length of `permutation` plus the initial value of `i + (n // k)`, which simplifies to `n + 1` since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs `n // k` times, adding `1` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `n * k`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will be `n + 1`, `i` will be `0`, and `curr_v` will be `n + 1`.
