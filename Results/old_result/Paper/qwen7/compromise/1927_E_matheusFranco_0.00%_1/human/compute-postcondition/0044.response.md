Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k` and must be less than `len(permutation)' and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`, `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still `i + k` and must be less than `len(permutation)'`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is still set to `curr_v`, but now `curr_v` has been updated to `curr_v + 1`.
