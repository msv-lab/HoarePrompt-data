Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was originally `i`, so after executing the line of code, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `i + k`. The values of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` and `i` relative to `len(permutation)` remain unchanged.
