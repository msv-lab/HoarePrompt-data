Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`.
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`.
   - `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 1`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(permutation)`.

5. **Check the current value of `i`**:
   - Since `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 1`, we can infer that `curr_v = len(permutation) + (i + 1) - 1 = len(permutation) + i`.
   - Therefore, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `len(permutation) + i + 1`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`**.
