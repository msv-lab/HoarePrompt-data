Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is equal to its original value plus `k`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is still equal to `curr_v + 1`.
