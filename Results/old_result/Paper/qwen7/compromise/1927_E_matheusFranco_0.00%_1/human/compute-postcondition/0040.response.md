Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` changes to `curr_v + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
