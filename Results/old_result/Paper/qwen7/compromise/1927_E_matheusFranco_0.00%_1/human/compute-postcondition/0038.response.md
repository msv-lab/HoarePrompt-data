Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`.
3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`.
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially set to `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(permutation)`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is directly dependent on `i`, and `i` is `i + 1` at the start of the loop, `i` itself must be less than `len(permutation)` minus 1 (because `i` will increment by 1 at the start of the loop).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being less than `len(permutation)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`, `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
