Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop, which are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < m`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - `a` is an input integer (not modified by the loop)
   - `b` is an input integer (not modified by the loop)
   - `sum_f` is `f` (not modified by the loop)
   - `f` is an input integer (not modified by the loop)

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, after the previous iteration where `j` was 1, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. Given that `j` is now 2, `m` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

**Final State**:
- `j` is 2
- `m` must be greater than 2
- `a` remains an input integer (unchanged)
- `b` remains an input integer (unchanged)
- `sum_f` remains `f` (unchanged)
- `f` remains an input integer (unchanged)

State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2**
