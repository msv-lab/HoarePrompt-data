You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, for each of the m lines describing pairs of friends, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        sum_f = 0
        
        for j in range(m):
            a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
        
        q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
        
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        
        p = p // gcd
        
        q = q // gcd
        
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` ranges from `0` to `t-1`. For each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, and `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`. After processing all iterations, `cn2` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, and `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`. The final output is the result of `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the output state will reflect the cumulative effect of all inputs processed within the loop. The variables `cn2`, `p`, and `q` will be updated based on the total sums and counts from all iterations, and the final printed value will be the result of the modular multiplicative inverse calculation applied to the simplified fraction `p/q` modulo `M`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t, followed by t sets of integers n, m, and k. For each set, it also processes m pairs of integers a_i and b_i along with an integer f_i.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
