Output State: **`j` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` updates `sum_f` by adding the value of `f` to it. Since `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` will now hold the value of `f`. The other variables (`j`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
