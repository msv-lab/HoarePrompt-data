Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `-1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus (m-1) times the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the last input integer.**

Explanation: The given code does not contain any operations that would change the values of the variables `cn2`, `j`, `sum_f`, `a`, `b`, or `f`. The value of `cn2` remains as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is decremented to `-1` after the loop finishes, `sum_f` accumulates the sum of all `f` values provided as input, `a` holds the value of the first `f` input, `b` holds the value of the second `f` input, and `f` holds the value of the last `f` input provided.
