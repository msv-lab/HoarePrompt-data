Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop condition is `j < m`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `m` must be greater than 2
   - `a` is an input integer (this variable is not involved in the loop)
   - `b` is an input integer (this variable is not involved in the loop)
   - `f` is an input integer (this variable is not involved in the loop)
   - `sum_f` is increased by `f` (this variable is not directly involved in the loop but might be updated inside the loop)

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. For the next iteration, `j` will be 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < m`. Since `j` is now 3, the loop will continue if `m > 3`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be 3.
   - `m` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `a`, `b`, `f`, and `sum_f` are not directly affected by the loop itself and their values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body. Since no information is provided about modifications to these variables within the loop, they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3**
