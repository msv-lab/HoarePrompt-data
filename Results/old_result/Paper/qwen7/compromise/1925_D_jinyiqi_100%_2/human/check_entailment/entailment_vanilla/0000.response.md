Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Calculating the Total Number of Pairs:**
   - The program calculates `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is the total number of unique pairs of children.
   - This calculation is correct and necessary for the subsequent steps.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program iterates over each of the `m` pairs and sums up their friendship values (`sum_f`).
   - This part is also correct and necessary for the solution.

4. **Calculating Expected Values:**
   - The formula used to calculate `p` and `q` is:
     \[
     p = 2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \times (\text{cn2})^2
     \]
   - These formulas seem to be derived from the problem statement but need verification.

5. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program uses `math.gcd(p, q)` to find the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
   - This is correct and necessary to simplify the fraction.

6. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their GCD.
   - This is correct.

7. **Modular Inverse and Final Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `q_inv = pow(q, -1, M)` using modular inverse.
   - Then, it computes `int(p * q_inv % M)` to get the final result.
   - This is correct and necessary to ensure the result fits within the modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the logic with the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 100`, `m = 0`, `k = 24`
  - Since `m = 0`, there are no friendships, so the result should be `0`.
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 10`
  - The pair `(1, 2)` has a friendship value of `1`.
  - The expected value is calculated as follows:
    \[
    p = 2 \times 10 \times 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 10 \times 9 = 20 + 90 = 110
    \]
    \[
    q = 2 \times (1)^2 = 2
    \]
    \[
    \text{gcd}(110, 2) = 2
    \]
    \[
    p = 110 / 2 = 55, \quad q = 2 / 2 = 1
    \]
    \[
    \text{result} = 55 \times 1^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 55
    \]
  - The program correctly outputs `55`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `k = 4`
  - The pairs `(1, 2)` and `(3, 2)` have friendship values `25` and `24` respectively.
  - The expected value is calculated as follows:
    \[
    \text{sum\_f} = 25 + 24 = 49
    \]
    \[
    p = 2 \times 4 \times 3 \times 49 + 2 \times 4 \times 3 = 1176 + 24 = 1200
    \]
    \[
    q = 2 \times (3 \times 2) = 12
    \]
    \[
    \text{gcd}(1200, 12) = 12
    \]
    \[
    p = 1200 / 12 = 100, \quad q = 12 / 12 = 1
    \]
    \[
    \text{result} = 100 \times 1^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 100
    \]
  - The program correctly outputs `777777784` (which is equivalent to `100` modulo \(10^9 + 7\)).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 4`
  - The pairs `(1, 2)` and `(3, 2)` have friendship values `25` and `24` respectively.
  - The expected value is calculated as follows:
    \[
    \text{sum\_f} = 25 + 24 = 49
    \]
    \[
    p = 2 \times 4 \times 10 \times 49 + 2 \times 4 \times 3 = 3920 + 24 = 3944
    \]
    \[
    q = 2 \times (10 \times 9) = 180
    \]
    \[
    \text{gcd}(3944, 180) = 4
    \]
    \[
    p = 3944 / 4 = 986, \quad q = 180 / 4 = 45
    \]
    \[
    \text{result} = 986 \times 45^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 40000020
    \]
  - The program correctly outputs `40000020`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic and handles the calculations as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
