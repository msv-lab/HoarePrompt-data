### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `sum` to 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n`, adding a value to `sum` using the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`.
   - This formula is not related to the problem's requirements. The formula seems to be calculating a sum of squares, which is unrelated to the matrix operations needed to maximize the sum.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated `sum` and `2n` (the number of operations).
   - It then prints `2n` operations, each of which is a permutation of the entire row or column, but these permutations are not meaningful in the context of maximizing the matrix sum.

4. **Permutations**:
   - The permutations printed are simply `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row and column, which does not change the sum of the matrix since the elements are just being reordered.

Given the above analysis, the program does not perform any meaningful operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. The sum calculated and the operations performed are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the problem description and does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements.

**Final: False**
