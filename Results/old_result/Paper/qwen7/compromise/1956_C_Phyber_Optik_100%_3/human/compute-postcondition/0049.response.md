Output State: **`sum` is increased by `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. This expression simplifies to `2 * i * i - i`. The value of `i` is also increased by 1 after the operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
