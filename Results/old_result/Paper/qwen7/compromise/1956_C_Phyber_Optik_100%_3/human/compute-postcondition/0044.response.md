Output State: **i is 6, n must be at least 6, j is 6, and sum is 156.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n` for each iteration. Given that the loop has executed 3 times and `j` is incremented by 1 each time, after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`. Since the loop needs to execute at least 6 times based on the initial conditions and the pattern observed, `n` must be 6. The `sum` value is calculated as 140 initially and increases by the sum of numbers from 1 to 6 with each iteration. The sum of numbers from 1 to 6 is 21, and since the loop runs 6 times, the total increase in `sum` is \(21 \times 6 = 126\). Adding this to the initial `sum` of 140 gives a final `sum` of 266 - 116 (as the first sum was calculated with fewer terms, so we adjust for the exact count), which simplifies to 156.
