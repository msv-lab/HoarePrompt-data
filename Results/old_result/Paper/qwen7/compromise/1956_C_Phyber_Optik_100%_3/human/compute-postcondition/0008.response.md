Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the range for `i` as `range(2, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values of the variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3 (because if `n` were 3 or less, `i` would not be less than `n + 1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 4**
