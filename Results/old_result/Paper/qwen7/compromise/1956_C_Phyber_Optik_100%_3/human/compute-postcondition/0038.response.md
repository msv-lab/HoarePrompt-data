Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`, and it ranges from 1 to `n + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 6
   - `n` must be at least 6
   - `j` is 1
   - `sum` is 140

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body and must still be at least 6.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - The value of `sum` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, `j` is 2, and `sum` is 140**
