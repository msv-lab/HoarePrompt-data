Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the given states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 6
   - `n` must be at least 6
   - `j` is 6
   - `sum` is 156

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
   - The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `sum` do not change based on the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (since it was not specified what `t` is, we assume it needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute).

State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, `j` is 6, `sum` is 156, `t` must be greater than 0**
