Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 6.
   - `n` must be at least 6.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `sum` is 140.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

   - The first argument to `print` is `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given `n` is at least 6 and `j` is 2, the minimum value of `n - j + 1` is `6 - 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given that `n` must be at least 6, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to determine the range. If `n` is 6, then `range(1, n + 1)` would be `range(1, 7)`, which expands to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `1`
- `5` (since `n - j + 1` is `6 - 2 + 1 = 5`)
- The sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (which is 6 in this case).

Output: **1 5 1 2 3 4 5 6**
