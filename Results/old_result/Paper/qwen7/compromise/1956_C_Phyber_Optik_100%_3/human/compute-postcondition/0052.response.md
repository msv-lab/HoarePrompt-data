Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is increased by `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`.
   - `i` is increased by 1.
   - `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i <= n`, so `i` must still satisfy this condition.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `sum` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `i` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sum` is increased by `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`.
- `i` is increased by 1.
- `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

For the next iteration:
- `sum` remains the same.
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `i` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`sum` is increased by `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, `i` is increased by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `n`**.

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the values at the end of the previous iteration were:
- `sum` is 10.
- `i` is 3.
- `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Then, for the next iteration:
- `sum` remains 10.
- `i` becomes 4.
- `i` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`sum` is 10, `i` is 4, and `i` must be less than or equal to `n`**.
