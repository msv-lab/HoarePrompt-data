Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 6.
- `n` must be at least 6.
- `sum` is 140.

The `print(sum, n + n)` statement will print the value of `sum` followed by the value of `n + n`.

Given that `sum` is explicitly stated as 140, and `n` must be at least 6, the value of `n + n` will be `2 * n`. Since `n` is at least 6, let's denote `n` as 6 for the minimum case to illustrate the calculation:

- `sum` = 140
- `n + n` = 2 * 6 = 12

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **140, 12**
