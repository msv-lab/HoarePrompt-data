The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, but since it is a placeholder and does not hold any state, and there are no other variables mentioned in the loop head, we do not need to adjust any states based on the loop head alone.

However, we should consider the context of the problem. The loop is iterating `t` times, and we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot infer any changes to the state inside the loop. Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **The loop has executed from \( j = 1 \) to \( j = n \), updating the sum according to the formula \( \text{sum} += 2i^2 - i \) for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n + 1 \). The final value of `sum` is the result of this summation. The loop will now execute one more time, with \( t \) incremented by 1.**
