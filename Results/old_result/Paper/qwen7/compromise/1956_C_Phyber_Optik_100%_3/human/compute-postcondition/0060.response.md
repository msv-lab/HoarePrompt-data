Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(1, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is 156 (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `i` is 3 (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `j` is 1 (this is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration)
   - `n` must be at least 6 (this is the condition for the loop to continue)
   - `t` is greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the loop head)

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be at least 6. Since no information is given about changes to `n`, we assume it remains the same or increases, but the minimum value is still 6.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0**
