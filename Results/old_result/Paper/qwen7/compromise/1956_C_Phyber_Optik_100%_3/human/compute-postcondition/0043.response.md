Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 6.
   - `n` must be at least 6.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `sum` is 140 (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

   - The first argument `2` is directly printed.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given `n` must be at least 6 and `j` is 3, the minimum value for `n - j + 1` would be `6 - 3 + 1 = 4`. Since `n` can be any value greater than or equal to 6, the exact value depends on `n`, but it will always be `n - 3 + 1`.
   - The third argument is the unpacked range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means it will print all numbers from 1 up to `n`.

Given these points, let's determine the exact output:

- The first number printed is `2`.
- The second number printed is `n - 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.
- The third part of the print statement is the range from 1 to `n + 1`, which will print all integers from 1 up to `n`.

Since `n` must be at least 6, the smallest possible output for the range part would be `1 2 3 4 5 6` if `n` is 6. If `n` were larger, the range would include more numbers.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2, n - 2, 1 2 3 4 5 6 (if n is 6, otherwise 1 2 3 ... up to n)**
