Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is an input integer, `j` is 6, `sum` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0**

The code `sum = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `sum`. This updates the value of `sum` from its initial value of 156 to 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
