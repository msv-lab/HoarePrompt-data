Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.
2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `i` is 6
   - `n` must be at least 6
   - `j` is 2
   - `sum` is 140
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means `j` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.
4. **Analyze the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
5. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 3.
6. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `j` is 2 and `n` is at least 6, the condition `j <= n + 1` is satisfied.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, `j` is 3, and `sum` is 140**
