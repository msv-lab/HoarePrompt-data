Based on the initial state provided:

- `sum` is explicitly given as 156.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be at least 6 but no explicit value is given, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `t` is greater than 0 but no explicit value is given, so we cannot determine its exact value.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down:

1. `1`: This is a constant value.
2. `n - j + 1`: Given `j` is 3, this expression simplifies to `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` must be at least 6, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to illustrate the output:
- If `n = 6`, then `n - 2 = 4`.

So, the output will be:
- `1` (constant value).
- `4` (value of `n - 2` when `n = 6`).
- The numbers from 1 to 6 (inclusive), which are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 4 1 2 3 4 5 6**
