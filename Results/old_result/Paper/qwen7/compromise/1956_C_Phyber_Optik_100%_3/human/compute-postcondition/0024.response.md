Output State: **`n` is an input integer, the loop will now execute one more time, with `t` incremented by 1.**

The initial state involves a loop that has updated the sum according to the formula \( \text{sum} += 2i^2 - i \) for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n + 1 \). After this, the code takes an input for `n` and does not affect the previously calculated sum or the value of `t`. The only change is that the loop will now execute one more time, with `t` incremented by 1.
