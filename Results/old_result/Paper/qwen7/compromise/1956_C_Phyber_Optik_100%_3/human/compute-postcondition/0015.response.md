To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement:

1. The `print` statement is: `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.

2. The statement uses three arguments:
   - The first argument is `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range object into individual elements.

Given these points, we need to know the values of `n` and `j` to fully determine the output. Since the values of `n` and `j` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Let's describe the output step-by-step:

- The first number printed is `2`.
- The second number printed is `n - j + 1`.
- The third part of the output is the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2, n - j + 1, 1 2 ... n**
