Based on the initial state provided:

- `sum` is 156.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 6.
- `t` is greater than 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(sum, n + n)
```

From the initial state, we know `sum` is 156. However, the value of `n` is not explicitly given. Given that `i` is 3 after 3 iterations and the loop increments `i` by 1, and considering the pattern of the loop, `n` must be at least 6 (since `i` starts from 2 and goes up to 6). 

Since the loop has completed 3 full iterations and `i` is now 4, and the next iteration would make `i` 5, and the following iteration would make `i` 6, it implies that `n` is 6. Therefore, `n + n` is `6 + 6 = 12`.

So, the print statement will output the value of `sum` (which is 156) and `n + n` (which is 12).

Output: **156, 12**
