The function processes three positive integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with two lists \( A \) and \( F \). It calculates the maximum difference (\( \text{max\_diff} \)) between consecutive elements in \( A \) and finds the index where this maximum difference occurs. It then searches through the list \( D \) using binary search to find the optimal value of \( f \) from \( F \) that minimizes the maximum absolute difference between elements in \( A \) and elements in \( D \) adjusted by \( f \). Finally, it prints the maximum of \( \text{max\_diff} \) and the second largest difference (\( \text{next\_max\_diff} \)).
