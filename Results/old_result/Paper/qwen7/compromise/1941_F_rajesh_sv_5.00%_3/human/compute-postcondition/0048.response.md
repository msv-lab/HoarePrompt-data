Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` must be less than `h`; `l` is updated to `mid + 1`**.

This means that the variable `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
