Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is `mid`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

Explanation: The line `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
