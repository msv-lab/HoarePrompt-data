Output State: **`max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is `None`, `i` is `3`, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `next_max_diff = diff` assigns the current value of `diff` to `next_max_diff`. Since `diff` is already defined as `A[1] - A[0]` and is greater than `-inf`, the value of `next_max_diff` becomes `diff`. The other variables (`max_diff`, `index`, `i`) remain unchanged.
