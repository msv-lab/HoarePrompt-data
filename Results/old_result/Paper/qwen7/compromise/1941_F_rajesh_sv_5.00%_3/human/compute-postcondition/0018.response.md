Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is `3`, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` remains `-inf`, `index` is set to `2`, and `i` remains `2`. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is set to `diff`, `index` remains `None`, and `i` is incremented to `3`.
