Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is 7, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`**.

This output state reflects that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1 (from 6 to 7), and `diff` has been calculated as the difference between `A[6]` and `A[5]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
