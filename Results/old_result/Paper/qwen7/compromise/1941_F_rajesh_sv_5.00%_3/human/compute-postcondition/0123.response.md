Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `l` is either `mid + 1` or `h`, `h` is either unchanged or assigned to `mid`, `left` must be less than `right` plus `f`, and `l < h` must be true.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block. If the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `mid` is assigned to `h`. In both cases, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, and the other conditions are preserved.
