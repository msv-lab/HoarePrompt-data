Output State: **`f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`, `l` is the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `mid_sum` the value of `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` the value of `D[mid + 1] + f`. The values of `f`, `l`, `h`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are calculated based on the current values of `D[mid]`, `D[mid + 1]`, and `f`.
