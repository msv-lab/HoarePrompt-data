Output State: The final output state will have `l` being the smallest index such that for all indices `i` from `l` to `h`, the condition `D[i] + f >= left` holds, and `h` being the largest index such that `D[i] + f <= right` for all indices `i` from `l` to `h`. The variables `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` will reflect the last computed values within the loop, but their exact values are not as critical as the bounds `l` and `h`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `l` will point to the smallest index where the adjusted value (`D[index] + f`) meets or exceeds the `left` threshold, and `h` will point to the largest index where the adjusted value (`D[index] + f`) is less than or equal to the `right` threshold. This means the range `[l, h]` contains all elements that satisfy the condition when adjusted by `f`.
