Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is `mid`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `mid`, and `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`**.

Explanation: The code `h = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to `h`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `h` is updated to `mid`, while `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and the condition involving these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
