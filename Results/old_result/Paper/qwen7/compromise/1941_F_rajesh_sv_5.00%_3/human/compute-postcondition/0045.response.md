Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` must be less than `h`**.

This means that `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, and then `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are assigned the values of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. The values of `h`, `l`, and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
