Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is either `mid` or `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `mid` is updated to the midpoint between `l` and `h`. The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
