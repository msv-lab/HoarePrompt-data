Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is either `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` or `mid`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is updated to the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, `l`) retain their previous values as no changes were made to them in the given code snippet.
