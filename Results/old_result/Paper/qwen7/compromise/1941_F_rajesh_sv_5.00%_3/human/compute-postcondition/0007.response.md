Output State: `func_6()` has been called 10^4 times.

Explanation: The loop runs `testcases` times, which is the result of `func_3()`. Since the output states indicate that `func_6()` is called each time the loop iterates, and there are no constraints or conditions within the loop that would alter the number of calls to `func_6()`, we can conclude that `func_6()` will be called exactly `testcases` times, which ranges from 1 to 10^4. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `func_6()` will have been called 10^4 times.
