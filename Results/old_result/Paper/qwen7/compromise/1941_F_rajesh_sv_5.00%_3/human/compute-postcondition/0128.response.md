Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `mid`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`**.

Explanation: The code `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
