Output State: **The program returns a list called 'cases' containing tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer 'n' followed by a string 's', where these values were read from standard input during the iterations of the loop.**

This means that the program reads pairs of values (an integer and a string) from standard input and stores them as tuples within the list `cases`. The `return cases` statement returns this list of tuples.
