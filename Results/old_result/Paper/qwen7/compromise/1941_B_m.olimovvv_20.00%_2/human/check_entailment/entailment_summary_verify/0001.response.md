### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if we can make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying an operation that reduces three specific elements of the array.
2. **Key Observations**:
   - The operation involves reducing `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - For the operation to be effective, the elements involved must be such that they can be reduced to zero through repeated applications.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the first element (`a[0]`) is odd and the second element (`a[1]`) is not `a[0] + 2`, it's impossible to reduce them both to zero.
   - Similarly, if the last element (`a[n-1]`) is odd and the second last element (`a[n-2]`) is not `a[n-1] + 2`, it's also impossible to reduce them both to zero.
4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly checks if the first and last elements meet the criteria mentioned above.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the given code matches the problem requirements.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The conditions checked only for the first and last elements are not sufficient to determine if all elements can be reduced to zero. The given code does not check the entire array to ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero through the described operations.
   - For instance, consider the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. According to the given code, since `a[0]` is odd and `a[1]` is not `a[0] + 2`, it would print 'NO'. But, as shown in the problem note, it is actually possible to make all elements zero by performing the operations as described.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. While it checks the first and last elements, it fails to verify the entire array to ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero through the described operations.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
