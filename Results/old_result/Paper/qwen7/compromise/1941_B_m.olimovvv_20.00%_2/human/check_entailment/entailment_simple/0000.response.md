Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
2. The provided solution checks two specific conditions for the first and last elements of the array:
   - `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`: This condition checks if the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2.
   - `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`: This condition checks if the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.
3. If either of these conditions is true, the function prints 'NO', indicating it's not possible to make all elements zero. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
4. However, the logic in the provided solution is flawed. The conditions only check the first and last elements, but they do not account for the entire array and the operations allowed. The operations allow reducing three consecutive elements, which means the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the array should be considered.
5. A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the array is divisible by 3, as each operation reduces the sum by 3. Additionally, the array should not have any elements that prevent achieving zero for all elements through the allowed operations.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
