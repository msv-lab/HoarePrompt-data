Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and an array `a` consisting of `n` integers (where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints on `t`, `n`, and the values in array `a`.
