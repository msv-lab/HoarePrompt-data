Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from the user, where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it checks the relationship between these integers and prints one of three possible outputs: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but prints the results directly. The initial values of \(t\) and \(q\) remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.**
