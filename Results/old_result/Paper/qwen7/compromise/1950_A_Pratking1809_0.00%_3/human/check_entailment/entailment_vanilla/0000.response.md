### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func()` is defined but not called. This means that the function will not execute unless it is invoked. Since the problem statement does not mention any specific function call, we assume the function should be executed directly.

2. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input. It then iterates over these test cases using a loop.

3. **Reading Test Cases**: Inside the loop, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`.

4. **Stair Condition Check**: The code checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met. This part is correct.

5. **Peak Condition Check**: The code checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. However, there is an issue with this check:
   - The condition `a < b > c` can be simplified to `a < b and b > c`.
   - The current implementation does not handle the case where `a >= b` properly. It will print 'PEAK' even if `a >= b`, which is incorrect.

6. **Else Block**: If neither condition is met, the code prints 'NONE'. This part is correct.

### Corrected Code:

To fix the issue with the peak condition, the code should be modified to ensure that both conditions are checked properly. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the original code, the peak condition check is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where `a >= b`. Therefore, the original program is not fully correct.

**Correctness: **False**
