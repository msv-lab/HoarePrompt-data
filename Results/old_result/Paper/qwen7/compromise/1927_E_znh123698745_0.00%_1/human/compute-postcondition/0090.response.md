Postcondition: `k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `i` is 3 or 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the numbers 1 and 2 followed by either the element at index `-1` of list `a` (decreased by 1) or the element from `array` indexed by `a[0]` (which is now `a[0] + 1`), `a` is a list containing either [2, -2], [3, -1], [3, -2], or [4, -1] depending on the condition `-1`.
