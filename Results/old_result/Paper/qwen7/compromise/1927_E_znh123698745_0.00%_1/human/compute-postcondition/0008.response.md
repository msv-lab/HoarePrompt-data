Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `answer` contains the element at index `a[-1]` of `array`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `a[-1]` of `array` to the list `answer`. Since `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `answer` now includes the element at the specified index.
