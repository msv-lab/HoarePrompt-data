Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1; `answer` now contains the element `array[a[0]]`, `a[0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. Given that `a[0]` initially contained the element `array[a[0]]`, and since `a[0]` was initially 0 (implied from the context), after the increment, `a[0]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
