Output State: **`answer` appends the value of `array[a[-1]-1]`, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Since the initial state had `answer` appending the value of `array[a[-1]]`, after decrementing, `answer` will now append the value of `array[a[-1]-1]`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
