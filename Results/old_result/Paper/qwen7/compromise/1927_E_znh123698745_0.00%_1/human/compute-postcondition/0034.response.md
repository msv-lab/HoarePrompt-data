Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.**

Explanation: The code creates a list named `array` using the `range` function, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
