Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `array[a[-1]]` is appended to `answer`**

Explanation: The code appends `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. However, the values of `array` and `a` are not provided, so they remain unchanged. The values of `i` and `n` are also unchanged. Therefore, the only updated information is that `array[a[-1]]` has been appended to `answer`.
