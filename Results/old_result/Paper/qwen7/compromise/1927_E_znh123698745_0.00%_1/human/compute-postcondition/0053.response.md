Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is at least 2

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `n` is at least 2, and `i` is now 3, the condition `i < n` will be `3 < n`.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to update the state to reflect the new value of `i`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 2**
