Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1.**

The code initializes a new list `a` with the values `[1, -1]`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `array`, or `answer`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
