Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input for `n`. This input replaces the value of `t` in the initial state since the initial state only mentions `t` and does not specify its exact value. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged but is no longer relevant as `n` has taken its place in the context of the current execution.
