### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the corrected approach:

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly limits the frequency of any card to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem. We need to keep the actual counts of each card.

2. **Finding Minimum Cards:**
   - The logic of checking if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary and printing `k - 1` is flawed. This approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to calculate the frequency of each card number.
   - Determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
   - Calculate the remaining cards after performing the maximum possible exchanges.

The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses these issues correctly. Here is a detailed breakdown of the corrected program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the frequency of each card number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # Calculate the number of full groups of k cards
        full_groups = count // k
        # Each full group can be reduced to k-1 cards
        min_cards += full_groups * (k - 1)
        # Add the remaining cards that cannot form a complete group of k
        min_cards += count % k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This program correctly handles the frequency calculation and determines the minimum number of cards left after performing the maximum possible exchanges.

### Final Evaluation

Given the corrected program and the analysis, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues and providing the correct solution.

Final: **True**
