Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards remaining after performing a series of operations where you can exchange up to `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards.
2. **Key Insight**: The critical insight here is that after each operation, the total number of cards decreases by 1. Therefore, the minimum number of cards left is determined by how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed and exchanged.
3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards (`n`) and the value of `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers (`nums`).
   - The program checks if `k > n`. If true, it prints `n` because no exchanges can be made.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the frequency table of card numbers, ensuring each count does not exceed `k`.
   - It then checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency table. If true, it prints `k - 1` because this means we can perform exchanges until only `k - 1` cards remain.
   - If `k` is not in the values, it prints `n` because no exchanges can reduce the count below `n`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly counts the frequency of each card number and ensures the count does not exceed `k`.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The steps are logically sound and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
