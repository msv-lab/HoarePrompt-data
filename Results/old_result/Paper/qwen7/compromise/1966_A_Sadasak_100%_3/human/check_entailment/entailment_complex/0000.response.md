Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations any number of times.
2. The annotated program correctly handles the input and calls a helper function `func_1` to process the card counts.
3. The helper function `func_1` correctly creates a frequency table where each number's count is capped at `k`.
4. After processing the frequency table, the main program logic checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency table:
   - If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1` because we can always reduce the count of a number to `k - 1` by performing the operation.
   - If `k` is not present, it prints `n` because no further reduction is possible.
5. The logic in the main program matches the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
