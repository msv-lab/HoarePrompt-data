Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from `arr`, and its value is capped at `k`. If any number in `arr` appears more than `k` times, its value in `frequency_table` will be set to `k`; otherwise, it will be the actual count of that number in `arr`.**
