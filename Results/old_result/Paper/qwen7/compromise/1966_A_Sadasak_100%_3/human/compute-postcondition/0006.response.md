Functionality: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It processes this input to create a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from `arr`, and its corresponding value is the minimum of the number's actual frequency in `arr` and `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its value in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. The function then returns this `frequency_table`.
