Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12 correctly. According to the problem description, when the hour is 12 in 24-hour format, it should be represented as "12:xx PM" in 12-hour format. However, the program incorrectly prints "00:xx PM" for the hour 12. For example, if the input is "12:14", the program outputs "12:14 PM" instead of the correct "12:14 PM". This can be seen in the test case "12:14" in the example input, where the output is "12:14 PM" but should be "12:14 PM".

To fix this, the condition for checking if the hour is 12 should be handled separately:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '12':
            print('12', end='')
        elif h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

This updated version correctly handles the special case for 12 o'clock.
