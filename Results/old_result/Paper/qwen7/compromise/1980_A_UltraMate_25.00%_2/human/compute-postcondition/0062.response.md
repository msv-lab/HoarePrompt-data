Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is derived from `hmp`.
   - The loop variable `i` is used to iterate through each element in `hmp`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions:**
   - `hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF'.
   - The first element of `hmp` is 'A'.
   - `m` is equal to the character following 'A' in the alphabet, which is 'B'.
   - `ans` is the value of `m` minus 'A', which is `ord('B') - ord('A') = 1`.

3. **Determine the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.
   - After the first iteration, `hmp[i]` (which is 'A') is compared to `m` ('B'). Since 'A' is less than 'B', the loop continues.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `hmp`, which is 'B'.
   - We need to check if `'B'` is less than `m` ('B'). Since it is not, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - Therefore, `ans` will still be 1.

5. **Update the state:**
   - `hmp` remains the same: 'ABCDEF'.
   - `i` will be 'B'.
   - `m` remains 'B'.
   - `ans` remains 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'B', `m` is equal to the character following 'B' in the alphabet, and `ans` is the value of `m` minus 'A'.** 

Since `m` is the next character in the alphabet after 'B', `m` is 'C', and `ans` is `ord('C') - ord('A') = 2`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'B', `m` is 'C', and `ans` is 2.**
