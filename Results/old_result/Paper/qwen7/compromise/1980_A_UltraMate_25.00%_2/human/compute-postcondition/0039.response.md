Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `ans`, which was defined as the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. Since `ans` is now explicitly set to 0, the previous calculation is no longer valid. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
