Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `hmp` must contain at least one element.
- The loop condition is `for i in hmp`, which means `i` is an element from the dictionary `hmp`.

### Loop Body
- The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head `for i in hmp` involves the variable `i` and the dictionary `hmp`.

2. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is an element from `hmp`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.
   - The dictionary `hmp` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - `hmp` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.

### Conclusion
At the start of the next iteration, `hmp` must still contain at least one element, and `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.

### Final State
State: **`hmp` must contain at least one element, and `i` will be the next key in `hmp`**.
