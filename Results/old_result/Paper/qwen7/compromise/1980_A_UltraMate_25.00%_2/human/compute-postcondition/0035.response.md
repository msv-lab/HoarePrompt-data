Based on the initial state provided:

- `hmp` is a dictionary that has been iterated over.
- `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

When the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum described above.

To break it down further:
- For each key `i` in `hmp`, if `hmp[i] < m`, then `m - hmp[i]` is added to `ans`.
- The final value of `ans` is the sum of all such differences.

Therefore, the output will be the computed sum based on the given formula.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m - hmp[i] for all keys i in hmp where hmp[i] is less than m)**
