Output State: **`i` is the next element in `p` after 'B', `ans` is increased by `m`, `hmp` and `m` remain unchanged**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. The other variables (`i`, `hmp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `ans` being increased by `m`, while `i`, `hmp`, and `m` retain their original values.
