Postcondition: `hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'A', `m` is equal to the character following 'A' in the alphabet, and `ans` is the value of `m` minus 'A'. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is set to the value of `m` minus 'A'. If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, then `ans` remains unchanged.
