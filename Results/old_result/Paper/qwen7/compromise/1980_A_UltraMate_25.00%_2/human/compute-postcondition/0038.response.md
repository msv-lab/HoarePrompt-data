Output State: **`s` is the input string, `ans` is equal to the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, and `m`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
