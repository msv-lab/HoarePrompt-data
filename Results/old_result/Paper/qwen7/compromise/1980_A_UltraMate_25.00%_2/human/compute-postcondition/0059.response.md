Output State: **`hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'A', `m` is equal to the character following 'A' in the alphabet, `ans` is the value of `m` minus 'A'.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m - hmp[i]` increments `ans` by the difference between `m` and the i-th element of `hmp`. Given that `hmp` starts with 'A' and `m` is greater than 'A', `m` must be the next character in the alphabet, which is 'B'. Since `i` is 0 (as the first element is 'A'), `hmp[i]` is 'A'. Thus, `ans` is updated to `ans + ('B' - 'A')`, which simplifies to `ans + 1` if we consider ASCII values. However, since `ans` was not initialized before, it is assumed to be 0 initially, so `ans` becomes 1.
