Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All elements in 'ABCDEF' have been iterated over. The variable `ans` is increased by `m` for each iteration where the current character `i` is not in `hmp`. Variables `hmp` and `m` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'A', `m` is equal to the character following 'A' in the alphabet, and `ans` is the value of `m` minus 'A'. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is set to the value of `m` minus 'A'. If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'B', `m` is 'C', and `ans` is 4. If the element at index `i` in `hmp` is less than 'C', `ans` is set to 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'A', `m` is 'C', and `ans` is 8 if `hmp[i]` is less than 'C'. Otherwise, `hmp`, `m`, and `ans` remain as they were initially.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
