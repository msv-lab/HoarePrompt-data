Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in p`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the Given State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 'B'
   - `ans` is increased by `m`
   - `hmp` and `m` remain unchanged

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The variable `i` is set to the next element in the iterable `p`.
   - Since `i` was 'B' in the previous iteration, it will now be the next element in `p`.
   - `ans` is increased by `m` in each iteration, so it will be increased again in the next iteration.
   - `hmp` and `m` remain unchanged.

Given these points, let's update the state for the next iteration of the loop:

- `i` will be the next element in `p` after 'B'.
- `ans` will be increased by `m` again.
- `hmp` and `m` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is the next element in `p` after 'B', `ans` is increased by `m`, `hmp` and `m` remain unchanged**
