Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`**.

This means that `t` remains within its original range, `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and a new variable `mid` is introduced, which is the integer division of `n` by 2.
