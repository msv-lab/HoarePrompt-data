State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Given the constraint `1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4`, `t` must be within this range.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself, ensuring it is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4.

Hence, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4.
