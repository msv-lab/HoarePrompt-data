Postcondition: `max` is the maximum value between `temp[1]` and the original `max`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and containing the next three elements sorted, and if `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.
