Postcondition: `max` is the maximum value between `temp[1]` and the original `max`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` and containing the next three elements sorted. If `temp[1] > max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.
