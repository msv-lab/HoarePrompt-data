Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` equals 2.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

The `print(min(a))` statement will print the minimum value among the integers in the list `a`.

Since the exact input string to split and convert into integers is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `min(a)`. However, we know that `a` is a list of integers derived from splitting a string, and `min(a)` will be the smallest integer in this list.

Output: **min(a) (where min(a) is the smallest integer in the list a obtained by splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer)**
