Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is now sorted version of `[a[n - 1], a[n], a[n + 1]]`, and `max` is either `temp[1]` if `temp[1] > max` initially, or `max` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `temp` which contains three elements: `a[n-1]`, `a[n]`, and `a[n+1]`. After sorting, `temp` becomes a sorted version of these three elements. The value of `i` and `max` remain unchanged from their initial states unless `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, in which case `max` would be updated to `temp[1]`.
