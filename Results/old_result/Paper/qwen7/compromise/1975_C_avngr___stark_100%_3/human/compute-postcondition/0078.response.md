Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `max` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the sublist `temp`. Since `temp` was originally a sublist of `a` from index `n - 2` to `n - 1`, after sorting, it becomes a sorted sublist from index `i` (which is `n - 2`) to `i + 2` (which is `n - 1`). The value of `i` and `max` remain unchanged.
