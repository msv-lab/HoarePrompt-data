Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value of the second largest element in any consecutive subarray of length 3 within `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n-4` and ending at index `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `max`, `i`, or `temp`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
