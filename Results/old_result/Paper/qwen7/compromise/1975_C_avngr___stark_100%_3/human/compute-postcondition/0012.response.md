Output State: **`max` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` and containing the next two elements sorted.**

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the sublist `temp` in ascending order. The values of `max`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The sublist `temp` now contains the next two elements from the list `a` starting from index `i`, and these elements are sorted.
