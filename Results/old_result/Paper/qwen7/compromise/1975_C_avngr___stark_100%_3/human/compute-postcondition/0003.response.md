Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
