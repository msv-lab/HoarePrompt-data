Output State: **`max` is equal to `temp[1]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` and containing the next three elements sorted.**

Explanation: The line `max = temp[1]` updates the value of `max` to be equal to `temp[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
