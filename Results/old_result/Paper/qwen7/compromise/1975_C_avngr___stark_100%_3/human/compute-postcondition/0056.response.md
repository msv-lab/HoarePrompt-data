Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 5, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is equal to `temp[1]`, and `i` is 5; `temp` is now a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index 5 and ending at index 7. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
