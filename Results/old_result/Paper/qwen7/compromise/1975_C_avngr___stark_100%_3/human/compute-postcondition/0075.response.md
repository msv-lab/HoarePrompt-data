Postcondition: `i` is `n - 3`, `temp` is a sorted list consisting of elements from index `i` to `i + 2` in the original list `a`. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is equal to the second element of `temp`. There is no change in `max` if the second element of `temp` is not greater than `max`.
