Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is equal to `temp[1]`, and `i` is 5; `temp` is now a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index 5 and ending at index 7.**

Explanation: The line `max = temp[1]` updates the value of `max` to be the second element of the list `temp`. Since `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index 5 and ending at index 7, `temp[1]` refers to the second element within this range. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
