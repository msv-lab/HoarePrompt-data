Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the values of `n` and `k` have been updated by the function `func_1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_1()` calls the function `func_1()`, which presumably returns two values: `n` and `k`. These values replace the existing values of `n` and `k` in the current scope. Since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact new values of `n` and `k`, but we know they have been updated by the function call. The initial conditions about `n` and `k` remain valid, just with potentially new values.
