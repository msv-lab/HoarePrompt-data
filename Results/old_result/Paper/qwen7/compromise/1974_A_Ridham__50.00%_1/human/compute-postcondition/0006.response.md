Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two non-negative integers x and y, and a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation on x and y and returns the result of these operations for all test cases.**

Note: The exact operations on x and y are not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the structure and nature of the input and output without detailing the internal operations.
