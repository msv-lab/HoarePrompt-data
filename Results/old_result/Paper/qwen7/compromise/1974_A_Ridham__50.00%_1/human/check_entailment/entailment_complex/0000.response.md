Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - The total space required for the 2x2 icons is correctly calculated as `space_y = y * 4`.

3. **Screen Requirement Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. If `y` is even, it uses `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, it uses `y // 2 + 1`. This is correct because each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and we need to account for the fractional screen requirement when `y` is odd.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`). This is correct because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

5. **Space Requirement for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if the remaining space is sufficient to fit all 1x1 icons (`if space_x <= remaining_cells`). If so, it directly uses the previously calculated number of screens for the 2x2 icons.
   - If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons (`extra_screen = space_x // 15 + 1` if there's any remainder). This is correct because each screen can hold up to 15 icons.

6. **Output**:
   - The program appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list and prints these values at the end.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the example provided. Therefore, the program should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
