Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the conditions provided. If \( n \) is odd, it prints \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \) depending on whether \( 2a < b \) holds. If \( n \) is even, it prints \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \) depending on the same condition. The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated values for each test case.**
