Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a flaw in how it handles the case when `n` is even. Specifically, the logic for even `n` does not always yield the minimum cost. The issue arises because the solution does not consider the possibility of buying an optimal mix of single and double promotions when `2 * a >= b`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we calculate the minimum cost by considering all possible ways to group the yogurts into sets of one and two, and then choosing the combination that minimizes the total cost.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost without any promotion
        cost_no_promotion = n * a
        # Calculate the cost with all promotions
        cost_all_promotion = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost with a mix of promotions and single purchases
        if n % 2 == 1:
            cost_mixed_promotion = (n // 2) * b + a
        else:
            cost_mixed_promotion = (n // 2 - 1) * b + 2 * a
        
        # Determine the minimum cost
        min_cost = min(cost_no_promotion, cost_all_promotion, cost_mixed_promotion)
        print(min_cost)
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible combinations are considered and the minimum cost is calculated accurately.
