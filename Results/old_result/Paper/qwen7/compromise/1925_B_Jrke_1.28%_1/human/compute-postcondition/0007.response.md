Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. If `k` equals 1, we continue the loop with the current values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if `k` does not equal 1.
