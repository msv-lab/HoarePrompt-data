Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This means that `int(input())` will read an integer from the input, and this integer should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

3. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute, the input value must be within the specified range. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the input value must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
