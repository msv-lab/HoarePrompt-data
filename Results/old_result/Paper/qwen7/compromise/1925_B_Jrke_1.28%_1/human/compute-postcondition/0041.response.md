Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans, i + 2]`, `i` is incremented by 2, `x \% 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to `int(x)`, and the list `l` is updated to `[ans, i + 2]` with `l.append(x // i)` added to it if `x // i <= k`.
