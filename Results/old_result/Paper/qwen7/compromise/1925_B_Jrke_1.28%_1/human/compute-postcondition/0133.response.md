Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three variables t, x, and n, where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. It returns a result based on these variables for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it uses `x` and `n` to determine the result, which is not specified in the given information.
