Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2; `l` is updated to `[ans, ans, i]`; `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `l` was initially `[ans, ans]`, after appending `i`, `l` becomes `[ans, ans, i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 2, and `ans` remains unchanged.
