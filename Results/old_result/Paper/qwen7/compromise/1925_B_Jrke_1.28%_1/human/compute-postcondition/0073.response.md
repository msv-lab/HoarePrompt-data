Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `l` is `[ans, i + 2]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains `[ans]`. After appending `i`, `l` becomes `[ans, i]`. Since `i` is defined as `i + 2`, the updated value of `i` is used in the append operation. The value of `ans` remains unchanged.
