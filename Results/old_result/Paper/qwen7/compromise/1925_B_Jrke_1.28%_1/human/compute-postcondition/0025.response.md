Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is \(i + 2\), `x \% 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the element `ans`.**

Explanation: 
- The line `l = [ans]` creates a list `l` that contains the single element `ans`. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, or `x % 2 == 0`. The loop condition `int(x)` remains unchanged.
