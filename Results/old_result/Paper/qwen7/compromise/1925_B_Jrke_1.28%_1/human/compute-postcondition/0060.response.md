Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer such that the remainder of `x` divided by `i` is 0, `l` is a list containing two elements which are 'ans' and `i`, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains one element 'ans'. After appending `i`, `l` now contains two elements: 'ans' and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
