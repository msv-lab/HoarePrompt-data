Output State: **`ans` is 1, `x` is the new input integer, `n` is the new input integer divided by the old `x`, `k` is `x // n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. The values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state as described in the precondition. The only change is the assignment of `ans` to 1.
