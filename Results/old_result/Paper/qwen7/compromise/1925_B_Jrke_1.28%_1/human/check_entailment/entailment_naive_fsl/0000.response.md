Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than `x // 2`. In such cases, the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties cannot be greater than 1 because the only divisors of a prime number are 1 and itself. However, the program might incorrectly output a value greater than 1 in these scenarios.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 4
```
The expected output is `1` because the maximum balance is achieved when the difficulties are `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, resulting in a GCD of `1`. However, the program might output a value greater than `1` due to its current logic.

To fix this, the program needs to check if `x` is a prime number and adjust the output accordingly when `n > x // 2`.
