Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0. If `lit[3]` is greater than `x` and `x` is infinity (indicating `a` is empty), then `a` gets appended with `lit[3]`, and `x` becomes the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` remains infinity. If `lit[3]` is not greater than `x` or `x` is not infinity (indicating `a` is not empty), then `x` remains unchanged, and if `b` is not empty, `x` becomes the last element of `b`; otherwise, `x` remains infinity.
