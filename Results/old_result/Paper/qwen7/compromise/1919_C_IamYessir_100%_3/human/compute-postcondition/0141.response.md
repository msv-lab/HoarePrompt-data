Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0. If `x` is infinity, it remains unchanged. If `x` is not infinity, then `x` is updated to `lit[3]` if `a` is not empty and `lit[3]` is greater than or equal to `x` and `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, `x` remains the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity.
