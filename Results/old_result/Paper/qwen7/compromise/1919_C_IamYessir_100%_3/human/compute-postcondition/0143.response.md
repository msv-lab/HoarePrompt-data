Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `cp` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `t` also remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop. The list `lit` remains the same as it is not modified during the loop. The lists `a` and `b` will contain elements based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, `a` will contain elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to the maximum value of `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty), and `b` will contain elements from `lit` that are greater than the maximum value of `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty).

In summary, `a` and `b` will be populated according to the comparison logic inside the loop, with `a` containing elements less than or equal to the maximum of `b` and `b` containing elements greater than the maximum of `a`. The final states of `a` and `b` will depend on the specific values in `lit` and how they compare to each other during the iterations.
