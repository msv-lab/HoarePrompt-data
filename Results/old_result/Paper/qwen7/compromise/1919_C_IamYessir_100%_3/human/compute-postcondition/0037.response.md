Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty). If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[i]`.
