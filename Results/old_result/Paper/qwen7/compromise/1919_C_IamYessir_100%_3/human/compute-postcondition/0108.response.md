Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, depending on whether the list `a` is empty or not, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether list `b` is empty or not; if `x > y`, then `b` now contains the element from `a` at index `i-1` if `y >= lit[i]`, or the element from list `a` at index `i-1` if `lit[i] > x`; otherwise, if `x <= y`, then `a` is modified to contain the last element of `a` appended with the element at index `i-1` of the original list `a` if `x == y`, or `a` contains the last element of `a` appended with the element at index `i-1` of the original `a` if `x < y`, and `b` remains unchanged if `x >= y`.
