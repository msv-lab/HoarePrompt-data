Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. The last element of list `b` is less than or equal to the value of `lit[i]`, and the current value of `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`. Additionally, the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`. The list `a` now has one more element which is equal to `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is already set to the length of list `b` minus 1, appending an element to `a` does not change the value of `i`. The conditions involving `n`, `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` remain unchanged. The only new information is that `a` now contains an additional element, which is `lit[i]`.
