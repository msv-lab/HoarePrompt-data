Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 2, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged. This is because the if condition `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x` is not met, leading to the execution of the else part which does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit`.
