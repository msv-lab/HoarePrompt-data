Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is 0, `i` will be equal to the length of list `b` plus 1 or 2, depending on the final comparison within the loop, `n` will be the total number of iterations executed, `x` will be set to infinity (`float('inf')`) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` will be unchanged (still `float('inf')`) or set to the last element of list `b`, lists `a` and `b` will contain elements based on the comparisons made during the loop execution, specifically `a` will accumulate elements based on conditions involving `x` and `lit[i]`, and `b` will accumulate elements based on conditions involving `y` and `lit[i]`, the list `lit` will remain unchanged from its initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(a)` is at least 1, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, the value of `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `s` is `s` + 1 if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`; `s` remains unchanged if `a[2]` is not greater than `a[1]`, and `len(a)` is at least 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `s` is incremented by 1 if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`, and `len(a)` is at least 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
