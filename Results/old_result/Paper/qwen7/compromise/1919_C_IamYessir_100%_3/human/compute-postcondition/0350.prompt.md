Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, `s` will be the count of elements in `a` where each element is greater than its predecessor, `n` will be the total number of iterations executed, `x` will be reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` will still be `float('inf')`, and lists `a` and `b` will contain elements based on the conditions involving `x` and `lit[i]` for list `a`, and `y` and `lit[i]` for list `b`. The list `lit` will remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `b` is a list such that the length of `b` is greater than 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is set to 1. There is no change in `s` if `b[i]` is not greater than `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `b` is a list with a length greater than 1, and `s` is 1. If `b[2]` is greater than `b[1]`, then `s` remains 1. If `b[2]` is not greater than `b[1]`, `s` remains unchanged at 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `b` is a list with a length greater than or equal to 4, and `s` is 2 if `b[3]` is greater than `b[2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
