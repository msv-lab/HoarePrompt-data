Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is an empty list except its last element which is now assigned to `x`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, the length of `a` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `a` will have one element (its last element), which is now stored in `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
