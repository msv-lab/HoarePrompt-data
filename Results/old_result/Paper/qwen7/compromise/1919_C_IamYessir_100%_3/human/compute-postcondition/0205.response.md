Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1; `n` must be at least 1; `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`; the last element of list `b` is now equal to `lit[i]`; the current value of `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` was previously equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, after appending, `i` remains equal to the new length of list `b` minus 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
