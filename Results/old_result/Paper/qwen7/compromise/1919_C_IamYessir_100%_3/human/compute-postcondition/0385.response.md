Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list with one more element than before, `b` is a list with at least zero elements, `cp` is 0, `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and the value of `x` is greater than or equal to the current value of `y`. This condition holds if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.
