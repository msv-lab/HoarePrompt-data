Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list where `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty); `b` now contains the element `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, `lit[i]` is `lit[0]`. The condition that `lit[i]` is greater than `x` is still valid, and all other conditions remain unchanged.
