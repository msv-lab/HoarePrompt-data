Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `x` is greater than `y` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to `x`. Since `a` was previously defined based on the conditions involving `x`, `y`, and elements of `lit`, the new value of `x` is now the last element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
