Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 2, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, and `b` now has one more element which is equal to the element at index `i-1` of list `lit`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `lit` to list `b`. Since `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1 before the append operation, after appending, `i` will be updated to the length of list `b` + 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
