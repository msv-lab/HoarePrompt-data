Output State: **`n` is an input integer decremented by 1, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `lit`. The value of `n` is an input integer that was decremented by 1 before this code was executed, so it remains unchanged in terms of its initial state description.
