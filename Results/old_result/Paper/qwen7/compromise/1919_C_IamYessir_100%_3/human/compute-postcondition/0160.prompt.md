Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. At this point, `a` and `b` will contain elements based on the comparison logic within the loop. Specifically, `a` will contain elements from `lit` where the conditions `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` or `x == y` are met. `b` will contain elements from `lit` where the conditions `y >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > x` are met. The values of `x` and `y` will be updated according to the last iteration's conditions. If `a` is not empty, `x` will be the last element of `a`. If `b` is not empty, `y` will be the last element of `b`. If both `a` and `b` are empty, `x` and `y` will remain as `float('inf')`. The variable `s` is now set to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `s` is 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then the postcondition remains as is. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition being true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `s` is 2, if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`. Otherwise, `i`, `len(a)`, and `s` remain as initially defined (i.e., `i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `s` is 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `s` is 1. If `a[3]` is greater than `a[2]`, the condition holds true. If `a[3]` is not greater than `a[2]`, the condition does not change from the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
