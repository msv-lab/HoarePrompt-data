Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b`, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` is set to infinity and `y` is infinity. If `lit[i] > y`, then `a` is updated by appending `b[i]` to it. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it.
