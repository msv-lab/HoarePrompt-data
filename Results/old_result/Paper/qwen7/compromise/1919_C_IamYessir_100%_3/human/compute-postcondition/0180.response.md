Output State: **`cp` is 0, `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `s` is the count of consecutive elements in list `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `cp = 0` initializes the variable `cp` to 0. None of the other variables (`i`, `s`, `lit`, `a`, `b`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
