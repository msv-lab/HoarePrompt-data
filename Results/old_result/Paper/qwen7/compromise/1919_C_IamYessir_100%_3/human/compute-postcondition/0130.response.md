Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, the list `b` now contains the element `lit[3]`, `x` is the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[3]` (since `i` is 3) to the list `b`. This changes the state of `b` but does not affect `i`, `n`, or `x`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and the conditions for `x` remain unchanged.
