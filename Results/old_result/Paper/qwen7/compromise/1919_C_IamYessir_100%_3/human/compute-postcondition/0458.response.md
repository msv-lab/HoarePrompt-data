Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+2]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity, `b` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the integer value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial postconditions. The new element in `b` is the integer value of `lit[i]` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, the value of `b` remains unchanged.
