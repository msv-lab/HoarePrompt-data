Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, `a` has its last element appended with the value of `lit[i]`, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the end of list `a`. Since `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `lit[i]` refers to the element at the index that is one more than the length of `lit`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged, and lists `b` and `lit` also remain unchanged.
