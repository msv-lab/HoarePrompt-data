Output State: **`n` is an input integer decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. For the next iteration of the loop, the input value will be decremented by 1. Therefore, the updated state is that `n` is the input integer decremented by 1.
