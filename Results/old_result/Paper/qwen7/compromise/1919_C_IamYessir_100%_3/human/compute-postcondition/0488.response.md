Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` (since `range(1, len(a))` generates numbers from 1 to `len(a) - 1`). Therefore, `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is a list with at least one element.
   - `s` is set based on the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0, and the condition checks `a[1] > a[0]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will become 2.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `a` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged unless the new condition `a[2] > a[1]` changes its value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `s` remains unchanged.**
