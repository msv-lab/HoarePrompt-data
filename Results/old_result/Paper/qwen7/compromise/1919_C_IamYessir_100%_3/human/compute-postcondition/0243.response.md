Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `x` is appended to list `a`, and `y` is strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`, and `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, if the last element of list `a` is appended to list `a` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` is the last element of list `b`. If `y` is less than or equal to the last element of list `b`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`, `lit[i]` is set to the last element of list `b`, and the last element of list `b` is appended to list `b`.
