Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer decremented by 1, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i]` relative to `x` and `y`. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` has an additional element `lit[i]` and `y` becomes the last element of `b`. Otherwise, `a` gains an additional element, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` while `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. `cp` remains 0, and `x` is greater than `y` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to an element in `lit`, `a` has one additional element and `b` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than an element in `lit`, `a` may have one more element depending on the relationship between `y`, `lit[i]`, and `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity, and `b` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]`, otherwise `b`'s state depends on whether `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]` or `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `a` is a list with one more element than before (the last element is `lit[i]`), and `b`'s state depends on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, `b` now contains an additional element which is equal to `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+2]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity, `b` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i+1]` if `y >= lit[i+1]` or `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
