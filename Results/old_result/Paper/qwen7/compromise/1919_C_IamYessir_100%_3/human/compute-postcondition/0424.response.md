Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, `x` is set to positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code sets `x` to `float('inf')`, which is equivalent to positive infinity. Since the initial state did not specify the value of `y`, it is assumed to be positive infinity. The conditions regarding `a`, `b`, and the comparison between `x` and `y` remain unchanged because no operations were performed on these lists or their elements.
