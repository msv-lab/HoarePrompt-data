Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list with one more element than before (specifically, `a` now contains `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y`) or a list with one element (if the condition `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x` is true), `b` is a list with at least one element (the appended element is `lit[i]` if the condition `lit[i] > y` is true or if `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x` is true), `cp` is 0, and `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `x` is less than or equal to `y`.
