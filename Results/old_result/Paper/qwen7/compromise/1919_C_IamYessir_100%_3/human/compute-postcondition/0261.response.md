Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` is set to infinity and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`, and list `b` has an additional element which is the same as `lit[i]`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is equal to the length of list `b`.
- After executing `b.append(lit[i])`, the length of list `b` increases by 1, so `i` is now one more than its original value (i.e., the length of the updated list `b`).
- The value of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
- The value of `y` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `lit[i]` is appended to list `b`.
