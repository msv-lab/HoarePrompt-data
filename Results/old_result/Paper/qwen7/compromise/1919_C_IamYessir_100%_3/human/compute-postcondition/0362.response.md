Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is either an empty list or a list with one element, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, and if `a` has one element, it is the last element of the original `a` list assigned to `x`, where `x` is positive infinity if `a` is empty.**
