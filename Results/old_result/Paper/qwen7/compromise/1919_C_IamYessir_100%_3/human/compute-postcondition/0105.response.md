Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, depending on whether the list `a` is empty or not, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether list `b` is empty or not; if `x == y`, then `a` is modified to contain the last element of `a` appended with the element at index `i-1` of the original list `a`. If `x != y`, then `a` or `b` is modified such that if `x < y`, `a` contains the last element of `a` appended with the element at index `i-1` of the original `a`; otherwise, `b` contains the element from list `a` at index `0`.
