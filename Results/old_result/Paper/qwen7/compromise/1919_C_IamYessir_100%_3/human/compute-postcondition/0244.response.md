Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `x` is appended to list `a`, and `y` is strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`, and `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, if appending `x` to list `a` and `lit[i]` being greater than `y` results in `y` being strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` not being greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` being the last element of list `b`, then `y` remains strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` becomes the last element of list `b`. If not, `y` is less than or equal to the last element of list `b`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `y` equals the last element of list `b`, `lit[i]` is set to the last element of list `b`, and the last element of list `b` is appended to list `b`.
