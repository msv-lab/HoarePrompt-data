Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1; `n` must be at least 1; and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`.**

The code assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. The length of list `b` remains unchanged, so `i` is still equal to the length of list `b` minus 1. The condition that `n` must be at least 1 is also unchanged. The length of list `a` is not equal to 0, and now `x` holds the value of the last element of list `a`.
