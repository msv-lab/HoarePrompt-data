Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. The last element of list `b` is less than or equal to the value of `lit[i]`, and the current value of `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`. Additionally, if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`, then the list `a` now has one more element which is equal to `lit[i]`.
