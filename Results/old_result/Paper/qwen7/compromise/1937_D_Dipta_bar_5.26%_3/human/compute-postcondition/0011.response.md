Output State: **`l` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '<' and '>', `A` remains the same as initially, `idx_A` remains the same as initially, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative distances from each '<' character to the nearest '>' character, calculated in reverse order.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, and `B` remain unchanged from their initial states.
