Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` correctly read and process the input data. `func_2` reads a line from standard input, `func_3` converts the read line into an integer, and `func_4` splits and converts a line into a list of integers. These functions handle the input reading and processing as required.

2. **Data Structures**: The `FenwickTree` class and `SortedList` class are used efficiently to manage and query the complexities of the problems. The `FenwickTree` class is a binary indexed tree (BIT) implementation, which is suitable for efficient range sum queries and updates. The `SortedList` class uses a combination of macro and micro lists along with a Fenwick Tree to maintain a sorted list and perform efficient operations like insertion, deletion, and querying.

3. **Main Logic**: The function `func_6` correctly calculates the initial maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the second maximum difference (`next_max_diff`). It then iterates through the functions to find the optimal way to reduce the imbalance by adding a new problem. The logic to find the best position to insert a new problem using binary search and the `SortedList` is implemented correctly.

4. **Output**: The function `func_7` processes each test case by calling `func_6` and prints the result. This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case as required.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum imbalance that can be achieved by adding at most one problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
