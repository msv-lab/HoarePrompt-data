Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, and `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, and `mid`) retain their previous values or expressions based on the initial state.
