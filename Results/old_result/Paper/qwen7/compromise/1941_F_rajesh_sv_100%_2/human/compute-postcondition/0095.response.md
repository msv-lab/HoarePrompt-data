Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates the new value of `mid` by taking the midpoint between `l` and `h`. Since `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, and `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, the new value of `mid` is the average index between these two points, rounded down. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
