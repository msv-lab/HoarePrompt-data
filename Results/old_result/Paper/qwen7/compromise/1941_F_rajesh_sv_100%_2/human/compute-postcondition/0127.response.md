To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head, specifically `l < h`.

Let's break down the given information:

- The loop condition is `l < h`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were updated:
  - `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`
  - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
  - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
- The update rules inside the loop are:
  - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` remains unchanged.
  - Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` and `l < h` must still hold true.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l < h` must remain true. Let's analyze the possible updates:

1. **If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`:**
   - `l` is updated to `mid + 1`
   - `h` remains unchanged
   - For the loop to continue, `l < h` must still hold true, which means `mid + 1 < h` must be true.

2. **Otherwise (`mid_sum - left â‰¥ right - mid_next_sum`):**
   - `h` is updated to `mid`
   - `l < h` must still hold true, which means `l < mid` must be true.

In both cases, the condition `l < h` must be maintained. Therefore, we need to ensure that either `l + 1 < h` or `l < mid` holds true.

Given that `mid = l + (h - l) // 2`, we know that `mid` is between `l` and `h`. Thus, ensuring `l < h` is sufficient to guarantee the loop continues.

Therefore, no specific adjustments are needed beyond ensuring the loop condition `l < h` remains true.

State: **`mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `l < h` must still hold true.**
