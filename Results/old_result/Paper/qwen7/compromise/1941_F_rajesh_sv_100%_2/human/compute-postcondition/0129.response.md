Output State: **`mid_sum` remains `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` remains `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `l < h` still holds true.**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`; it simply reassigns them to the same expressions they already held. The condition `l < h` also remains unchanged.
