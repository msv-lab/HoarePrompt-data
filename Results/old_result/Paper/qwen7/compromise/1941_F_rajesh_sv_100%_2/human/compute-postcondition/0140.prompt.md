Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_diff` holds the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second maximum difference found, `index` holds the index of the element where `max_diff` was found (or `None` if no valid `max_diff` was found), `i` is equal to `n`, `diff` is not defined, `left` is equal to `A[index - 1]`, `right` is equal to `A[index], `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will continue to execute until `l` is no longer less than `h`. At the end of all iterations, `l` will be equal to `h`, and both will point to the index in `D` where the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is no longer satisfied. The value of `mid` will be the last computed midpoint during the loop's execution, which will be equal to `l` (or `h`) when the loop terminates. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be `D[l] + f` and `D[l + 1] + f`, respectively, indicating the sums of the elements at these indices plus `f`. The variable `f` will retain its value from the last iteration of the loop, and the values of `D`, `left`, and `right` will remain unchanged from their initial or previous states within the loop. Additionally, if `l == h` is true, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `l` is the smallest index such that `D[l] + f >= right`, and `h` is the largest index such that `D[h] + f <= left`. If `l` equals `h`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of (`D[l] + f - left`, `right - D[l] - f`). Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when `l` does not equal `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. `l` is equal to `h`, and `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` retain their original values as they do not change in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
