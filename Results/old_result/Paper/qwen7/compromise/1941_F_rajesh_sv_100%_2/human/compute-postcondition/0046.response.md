Output State: **`h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`**.

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. The function `bisect_left` returns the index of the leftmost occurrence of the specified value in the sorted list `D`. Subtracting 1 from this index gives us the new value of `h`. The variable `l` remains unchanged as it was defined before the execution of the code snippet.
