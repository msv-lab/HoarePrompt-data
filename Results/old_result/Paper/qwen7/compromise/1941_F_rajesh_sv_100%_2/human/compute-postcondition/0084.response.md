Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is equal to `mid`, `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mid` to `h`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `h` is now `mid`, while `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and the inequality condition remain the same as the initial state.
