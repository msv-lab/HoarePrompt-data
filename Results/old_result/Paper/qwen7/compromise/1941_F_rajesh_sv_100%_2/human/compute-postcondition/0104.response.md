Postcondition: `l` is the smallest index such that `D[l] + f >= right`, and `h` is the largest index such that `D[h] + f <= left`. If `l` equals `h`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of (`D[l] + f - left`, `right - D[l] - f`). Since there is no else part, the values of `l` and `h` remain as determined by the loop, and `ans` is updated only when `l` equals `h`.
