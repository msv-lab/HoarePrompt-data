Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the length of the longest subarray where adjacent elements are equal, which is not the same as finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. 

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation where we can set a subarray to a single value. The cost of such an operation is the length of the subarray.

Here's why the provided program is incorrect:
- It calculates the length of the longest subarray with equal adjacent elements.
- This does not take into account the cost of setting the entire array to a single value using a subarray operation.
- It does not consider the possibility of setting the entire array to a single value without any operation if all elements are already the same.
- It does not handle the scenario where the optimal solution involves setting a non-contiguous subarray.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
