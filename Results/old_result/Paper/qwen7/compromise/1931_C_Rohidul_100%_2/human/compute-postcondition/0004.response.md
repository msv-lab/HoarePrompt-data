Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `l` and `r`. `l` is assigned the value 0, and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The values of `le`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
