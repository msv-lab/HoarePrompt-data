Output State: `end` is 4, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `r - 3`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[r - 1]` must be equal to `a[r - 2]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `end` will be incremented by 1 for each successful iteration. Since we know the loop executed 3 times based on the provided states, `end` will be 4 after all iterations. The variable `r` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, it will be `r - 3`. The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must hold true for the loop to continue, so `a[r - 1]` must be equal to `a[r - 2]` at the end of the loop. The other variables (`le`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `st`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
