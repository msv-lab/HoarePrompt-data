Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `end` is 3 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `le` is the length of list `a` (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
   - `a` is a list of integers (not directly relevant to the loop condition, but its content might change inside the loop)
   - `l` is equal to `r - 1`
   - `r` is now `r - 1`
   - `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
   - `a[n - 3]` must be equal to `a[n - 4]` (not directly relevant to the loop condition)

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves two variables: `r` and `l`.
   - We need to ensure that `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` are true for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `r` is now `r - 1`, and `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `l` is now `r - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than `l`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

5. **Final state**:
   - `r` must be greater than `l`, which means `r` must be greater than `r - 2`.
   - `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `r` and `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`.

**State:**
- `r` must be greater than `r - 2`
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`

In summary:
State: **`r` must be greater than `r - 2` and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**
