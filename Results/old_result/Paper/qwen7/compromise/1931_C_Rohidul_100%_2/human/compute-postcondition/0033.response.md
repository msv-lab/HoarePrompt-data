To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression for `ans`.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `le` is the length of list `a`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `l` is equal to `r - 1`.
   - `r` is now `n - 4`, so `l = n - 5`.
   - `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0.
   - `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.

2. **Expression for `ans`:**
   - `ans` is defined as `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
   - We need to know the value of `end`, but it is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Given the context, we assume `end` is a variable that needs to be determined or is already defined elsewhere in the code.

Since `end` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can still describe the expression for `ans` in terms of the known variables.

- `le` is the length of list `a`.
- `st` is the count of consecutive elements starting from the first element that are equal.
- `end` is some other value that is not specified in the initial state.

Given these, the expression for `ans` is:
\[ ans = \max(0, \text{length of } a - (\text{count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0} + \text{value of } end)) \]

Since `end` is not specified, we can only express `ans` in terms of the known variables and the unspecified `end`.

Output: **max(0, le - (st + end)) (where le is the length of list a, st is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0, and end is an unspecified value)**
