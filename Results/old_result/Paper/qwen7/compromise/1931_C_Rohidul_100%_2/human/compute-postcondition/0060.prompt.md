Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` is equal to `n - 4`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, `a[l + 1]` must be equal to `a[l + 2]` until the end of the list.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1 and `st` is also incremented by 1. This process repeats until no more consecutive equal elements are found between `l` and `r`. At the end, `l` will be one less than `r`, meaning `l = r - 1`. Since `r` is initially set to `n - 4`, it remains unchanged unless modified elsewhere in the code, which is not indicated here. The condition `a[0] == a[r - 1]` ensures that the first and last elements of the sublist defined by `l` and `r` are equal, as they were at the start. The value of `st` reflects the number of consecutive equal elements encountered, which is twice the number of steps taken because each step increments both `l` and `st`.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end + 1))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` is equal to `n - 5`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, `end` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `r` is equal to `n - 6`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, `end` is increased by 1 to `end + 1`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` must be decreased by 1 (so `l = r - 4`), and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end + 1))`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `r` is equal to `n - 7`, `l` is equal to `n - 10`, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `end` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
