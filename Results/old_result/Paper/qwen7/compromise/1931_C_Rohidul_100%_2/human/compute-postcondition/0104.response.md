Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the length of the longest subarray where adjacent elements are equal, adjusting the result if the first and last elements of the list are also equal. If all elements in the list are equal, the result is `1` if the first and last elements are the same, otherwise `0`.**
