Output State: **`r` is equal to `n - 6`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, `end` is increased by 1, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` must be decreased by 1 (so `l = r - 4`), and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end + 1))`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decreased by 1, so `r` is now equal to `n - 5 - 1 = n - 6`.
- The value of `st` remains dependent on `r` and `l`, so it is updated to `2 * (r - l - 1)`.
- The value of `end` is increased by 1.
- The values of `le`, `t`, `n`, `a[0] == a[r - 1]`, `l`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
