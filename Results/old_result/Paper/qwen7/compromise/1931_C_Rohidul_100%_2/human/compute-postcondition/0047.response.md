Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + 1 + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `st` is `st + 1`, `a[l + 1]` must be equal to `a[l + 2]`, `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
