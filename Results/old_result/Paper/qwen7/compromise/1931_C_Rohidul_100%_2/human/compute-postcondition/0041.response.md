Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`; `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `l`, we only know that it has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
