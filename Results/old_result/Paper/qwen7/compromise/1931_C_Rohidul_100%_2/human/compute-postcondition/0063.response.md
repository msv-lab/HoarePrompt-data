Postcondition: `ans` is `le - max(2 * (n - l - 1), end + 3)`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `l` is equal to `r - 5`, `r` is equal to `n - 7`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, the current value of `end` is increased by 3.
