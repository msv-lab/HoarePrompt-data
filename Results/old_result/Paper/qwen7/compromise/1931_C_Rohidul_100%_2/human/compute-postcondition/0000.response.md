Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python to indicate that the value of the loop variable is not needed. It is typically used when you want to iterate over a sequence but don't care about the index or value.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the input from `input()` provides a valid integer. The condition for the loop to continue is that the input should be a positive integer.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the input provided to `input()` results in a positive integer. Given that `t` is already a positive integer within the specified range, we can assume that the first input will be valid.

5. **Final State**: Since the loop depends on the input from `input()`, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this condition.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- The next input from `input()` must be a positive integer

Thus, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the next input from `input()` must be a positive integer**
