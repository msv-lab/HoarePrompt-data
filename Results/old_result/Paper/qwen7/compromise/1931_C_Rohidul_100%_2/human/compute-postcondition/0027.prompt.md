Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `end` is 1, `a[0] == a[1]` holds until `l` reaches `r`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1 and `st` (which counts the number of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0) is also incremented. This process repeats until `l` is no longer less than `r` or the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` is no longer true. At the end, `l` will be equal to `r` because the loop exits when the condition fails, meaning there are no more consecutive equal elements starting from index 0 up to `l`. The variable `st` will hold the count of these consecutive equal elements.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `end` is 2, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 3`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[0] == a[1]` holds until `l` reaches `r - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `end` is 3, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `r - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[n - 3]` must be equal to `a[n - 4]`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `r` is `r - 1` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`; `end` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
