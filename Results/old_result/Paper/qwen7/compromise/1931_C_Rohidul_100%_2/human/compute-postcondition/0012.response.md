Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `le` is the length of list `a`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `l` is 2.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `st` is 3.
   - `end` is 1.
   - `a[0] == a[1]`.
   - `a[1] == a[2]`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `l` is currently 2.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `a[2] == a[3]` (since `a[1] == a[2]` implies `a[2] == a[3]`).

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - To satisfy `l < r`, `r` must be greater than `l`. Since `l` is 2, `r` must be greater than 2.
   - To satisfy `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`, which is already given as true.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `r` to ensure `l < r`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is 2, `r` must be greater than 2, `st` is 3, `end` is 1, `a[0] == a[1]`, and `a[1] == a[2]`**.
