Postcondition: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 4`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, and `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`**.

This postcondition states that after the execution of the if-else block, `ans` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the length of list `a` minus the sum of `st` and `end`. Additionally, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `l` is `r - 1` where `r` is `n - 4`, `st` represents the count of consecutive elements starting from index 0 that are equal, and `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.
