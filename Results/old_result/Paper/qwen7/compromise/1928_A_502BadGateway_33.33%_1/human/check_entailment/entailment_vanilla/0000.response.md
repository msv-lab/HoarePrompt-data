Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is called for each test case.
   - The function checks if `b` (one of the dimensions of the rectangle) is even.
   - If `b` is even, the function returns `'yes'`.
   - If `b` is odd, the function returns `'no'`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify if the logic in `func_1` matches the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle.
- The key observation here is that if `b` (one of the dimensions) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with at least one dimension being even, allowing him to form a new rectangle by rearranging these pieces.
- If `b` is odd, no matter how Bob cuts the rectangle, the resulting smaller rectangles will have an odd dimension, and thus, he cannot form a new rectangle with a different area.

#### Verification:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns `'yes'` if `b` is even and `'no'` if `b` is odd.
- This aligns perfectly with the problem statement's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions.

**Correctness: True**
