State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate from `0` to `t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from `0` to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. The variables `start` and `end` are not directly involved in the loop's condition but are mentioned in the initial state. They do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
4. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function when the loop starts.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0.
