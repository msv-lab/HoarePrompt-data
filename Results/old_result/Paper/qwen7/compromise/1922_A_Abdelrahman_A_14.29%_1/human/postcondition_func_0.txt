The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of equal length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)). It checks if \(c\) contains any character not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) matches either \(a\) or \(b\), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if \(c\) contains only characters present in \(a\) and \(b\), it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, it prints 'NO' for each remaining test case.
