You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of equal length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)). It checks if \(c\) contains any character not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) matches either \(a\) or \(b\), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if \(c\) contains only characters present in \(a\) and \(b\), it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, it prints 'NO' for each remaining test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if `c` contains any character that is not present in either `a` or `b`. If such a character is found, it prints "YES", which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
10
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
3
acc
abd
abc
```

- In the first test case, the program will incorrectly print "YES" because it only checks if `c` has any character not in `a` or `b`, but it should check if `a` and `b` match a template while `c` does not.
- The correct approach would be to generate a template based on the characters in `a` and `b` and then check if `c` violates this template.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
- The program should generate a template based on the characters in `a` and `b`.
- For each character in `a` and `b`, if it is lowercase, it must be the same in the template.
- If it is uppercase, it must be different in the template.
- Then, it should check if `c` violates this template.

The provided solution does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results.
