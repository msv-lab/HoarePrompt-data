Reasoning:
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the lengths of the strings and the strings themselves.
- The function then checks if the string `c` matches either `a` or `b`. If it does, it immediately prints "NO" and moves to the next test case.
- If `c` does not match either `a` or `b`, it checks if `c` contains any character that is not present in either `a` or `b`. If such a character is found, it prints "NO".
- If `c` does not contain any character not present in `a` or `b`, it prints "YES".
- The function correctly handles the logic for determining if a template exists based on the given constraints.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function appears to correctly implement the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
