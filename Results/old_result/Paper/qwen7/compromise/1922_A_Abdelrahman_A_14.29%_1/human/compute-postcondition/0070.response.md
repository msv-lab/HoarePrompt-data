Output State: **`no` remains False and `c` is an empty string, `i` is `tests`, `slength` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `slength = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, storing it in the variable `slength`. The values of `no`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
