Output State: **`x` is the last character in the string `c` that was checked, `c` is a non-empty string, and the character `x` is not in the set `a` and not in the set `b`; `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no other operations are performed on the variables `x`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `no`, their values remain unchanged.
