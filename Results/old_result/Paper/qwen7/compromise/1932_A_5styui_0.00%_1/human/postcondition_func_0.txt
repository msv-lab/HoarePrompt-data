The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it counts the number of '@' characters in a string of length up to 50, which consists of '.', '@', and '*' characters. It prints the count for each case and maintains a total count of '@' characters across all cases. After processing all cases, it outputs the total count of '@' characters. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
