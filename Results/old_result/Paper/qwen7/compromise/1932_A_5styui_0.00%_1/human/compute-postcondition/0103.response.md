Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `range(len(b))`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over the indices of the string `b`. The variable `j` will take on values from `0` to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The problem statement mentions that `j` is the last index where `b[j]` equals '@'. However, this information is not directly relevant to the loop's execution because the loop will start from `0` and increment `j` until it reaches `len(b)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: The loop will start with `j = 0` and continue as long as `j < len(b)`. Therefore, the initial value of `j` should be `0` for the loop to start executing.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `s`, `b`, `i`, `a`, and `d` are not directly involved in the loop's execution. The loop's behavior depends solely on `j` and the length of `b`.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: `j` is 0, `b` is an input string, `s` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is the same as the initial value, `d` is an input integer**

However, since the loop's execution only depends on `j` and the length of `b`, the final state to adjust is:

**State: `j` is 0, `b` is an input string**
