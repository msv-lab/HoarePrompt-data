Output State: **`s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@' or `j` is 1 if `s` is 0, `d` is an input integer and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `b`, `j`, and `d`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no changes were made to the variables, their initial states remain the same.
