Output State: **The loop will continue to iterate as long as `b` is a non-empty string and the character at index `j` is neither '@' nor '*'. After all iterations, `j` will be equal to the length of `b`, `s` will be the count of '@' characters in `b`, and the loop will terminate without breaking prematurely due to encountering '*' characters.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have the value equal to the length of the string `b`, the variable `s` will contain the total count of '@' characters found in `b`, and the loop will have completed all its iterations without encountering any '*' characters that would cause it to break prematurely.
