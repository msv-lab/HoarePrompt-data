Output State: **`s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value (an index where `b[j]` equals '@'), `d` is the input integer and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variable `s` retains its value of 1, `b` remains a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value (specifically, to the index where `b[j]` equals '@'), `d` remains the input integer, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
