Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < len(b)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `b` is a non-empty string.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be 2.
   - `b` remains the same non-empty string.

5. **Check the conditions inside the loop**:
   - If the character at index `j` (which will be index 2 now) is '@', `s` is incremented by 1.
   - If the character at index `j` is '*', the loop breaks.
   - If the character at index `j` is neither '@' nor '*', no changes occur.

Since we are only asked to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, and the loop will continue as long as `j < len(b)`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `b` is a non-empty string**
