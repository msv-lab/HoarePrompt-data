Postcondition: `j` is 1 and `b` is a non-empty string. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', `s` is an integer which is 1 more than the original value of `s`. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `j` in `b` is neither '@' nor '*', the same conditions hold without any change.
