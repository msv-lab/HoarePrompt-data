Postcondition: `j` is 2 and `b` is a non-empty string. If `b[2]` equals '@', then `s` is 3 (1 more than its initial value). If `b[2]` is '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[2]` is neither '@' nor '*', the function also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
