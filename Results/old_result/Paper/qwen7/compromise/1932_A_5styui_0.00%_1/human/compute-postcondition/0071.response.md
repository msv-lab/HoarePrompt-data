Postcondition: `s` is 1 if the character at index `j` of `b` is '@'; otherwise, `s` remains 0. `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is an index within the string `b` such that if `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `b[j]` is not '*', `j` remains 0 and no other changes are made to the variables.
