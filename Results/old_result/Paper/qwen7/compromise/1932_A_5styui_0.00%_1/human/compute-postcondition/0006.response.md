Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `j` is the loop variable that will be initialized to 0 (since `range(len(b))` will start from 0).
   - `b` is a string that was obtained as input from the user.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `b`. Therefore, `j` must be able to iterate through all characters in `b`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` should start at 0 and increment until it reaches the length of `b`.
   - `b` must be a non-empty string to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` starting at 0 and `b` being a non-empty string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string**
