Output State: **`s` is 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` remains the same as the initial value, and `d` remains the same as before.**

Explanation: The variable `s` was initially set to 1 if the character at index `j + 2` in `b` is either `@` or `*`, and otherwise it is 0. After executing `s = s + 1`, the value of `s` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `j` and `i` are updated as per their respective increments, while `b`, `a`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states.
