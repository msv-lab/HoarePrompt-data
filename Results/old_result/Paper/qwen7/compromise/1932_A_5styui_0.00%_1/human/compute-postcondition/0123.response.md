Output State: **`s` is 1 more than its initial value, which was 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is `@`; otherwise, it is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is the same as before, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the same as the initial value, and `d` is the same as before.**

In natural language: The value of `s` is incremented by 1. If the initial value of `s` was 1 (when the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is `@`), it becomes 2. Otherwise, if the initial value of `s` was 0, it becomes 1. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and the values of `a` and `d` remain unchanged. The string `b` remains the same as before.
