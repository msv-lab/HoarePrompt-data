Output State: **`s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 1, and `d` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `d` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The values of `s`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
