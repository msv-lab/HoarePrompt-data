Based on the initial state provided, the variable `s` is set to the total count of '@' characters in the string `b`. The print statement will simply output this count.

Since the exact content of the string `b` is not specified, we cannot provide a numerical value for `s`. However, we know that `s` represents the number of '@' characters in `b`.

Output: **s (where s is the total count of '@' characters in the string b)**
