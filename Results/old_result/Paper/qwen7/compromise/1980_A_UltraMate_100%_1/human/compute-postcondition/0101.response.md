Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`**.

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `m` and the value of `hmp[i]`. The variable `i` remains as the next key in the dictionary `hmp`. The state of `m` and the dictionary `hmp` is not specified to change, so they remain as they are.
