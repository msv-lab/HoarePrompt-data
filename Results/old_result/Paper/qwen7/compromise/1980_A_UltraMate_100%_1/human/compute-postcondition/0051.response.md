The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the string `p`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 'B' and `p` is 'ABCDEFG'. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be a character in the string `p`. The next character in `p` after 'B' is 'C'.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 'C' and `p` will still be 'ABCDEFG'.

State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**
