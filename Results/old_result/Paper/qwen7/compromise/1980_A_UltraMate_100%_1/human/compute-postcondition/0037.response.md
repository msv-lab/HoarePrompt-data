Output State: **`t` is reduced by 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The initial state had `t` reduced by 1. After executing the code, `t` is further reduced by 1 due to the subtraction implied by the decrement. The variables `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`. Therefore, `n` and `m` are now input integers.
