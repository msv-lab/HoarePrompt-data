Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the set `hmp`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Initially, `i` is set to 'F'.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `hmp`**: Since `i` is currently 'F' and the loop iterates over all characters in `p` ('ABCDEFG') where `i` is not in `hmp`, we need to determine what `hmp` should be initially.

4. **Initial Value of `ans`**: The initial value of `ans` is given as `2*m`, which means `ans` is already initialized to `2*m`.

5. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in `hmp`. For each character `i` not in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` is initially 'F'.
- `p` is 'ABCDEFG'.
- `hmp` must contain all characters from `p` except 'F' (since 'F' is the initial value of `i` and the loop will check if `i` is not in `hmp`).
- `ans` is already initialized to `2*m`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `hmp` contains all characters from `p` except 'F', and `i` is 'F'.

**State:**
**`i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a set containing {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'G'}, `ans` is equal to `2*m`**
