Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split by space, `m` is another integer from the same input split by space.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the user input separated by a space and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially described to be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The variable `_` is not used and remains irrelevant.
