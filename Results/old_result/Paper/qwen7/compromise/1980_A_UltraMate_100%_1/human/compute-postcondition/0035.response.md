Based on the initial state described:

- `hmp` is a dictionary where each key's value is adjusted such that for every key `i` in `hmp`, `hmp[i]` is at least `m`.
- For any key `i` in `hmp` that was initially less than `m`, its value was incremented by `m - hmp[i]`.
- The variable `ans` is the sum of all increments made during the loop iterations.

When the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print the total sum of all these increments.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of all increments made during the loop iterations)**
