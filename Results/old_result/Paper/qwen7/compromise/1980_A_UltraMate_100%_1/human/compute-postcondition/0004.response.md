Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer from the input split by space, `m` is another integer from the same input split by space, `s` is the next line of input from the user, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
