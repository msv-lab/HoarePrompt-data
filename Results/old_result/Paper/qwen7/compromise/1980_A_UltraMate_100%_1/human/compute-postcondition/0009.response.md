Output State: **`i` is an integer that is not in the dictionary `hmp`; `ans` is increased by the value of `m`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. The initial state of `i` and `hmp` remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still an integer that is not in the dictionary `hmp`, and `ans` is updated to be its original value plus `m`.
