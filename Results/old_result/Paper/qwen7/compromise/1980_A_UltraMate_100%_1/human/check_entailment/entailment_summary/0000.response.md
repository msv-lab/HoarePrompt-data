Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\), and the string \(a\) representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string \(a\).

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - For each difficulty level that is not present in the input string, it assumes \(m\) additional problems are needed.
   - For each difficulty level present but with fewer than \(m\) occurrences, it calculates the difference \(m - \text{occurrences}\) and adds this to the total count.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Given the detailed execution summary and the provided example, the program accurately computes the required number of additional problems for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
