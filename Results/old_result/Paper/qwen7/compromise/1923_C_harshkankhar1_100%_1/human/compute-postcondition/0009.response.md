Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer. For each test case, it accepts parameters n and q, both positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. It also accepts an array c, which is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, for each query, it accepts parameters l_i and r_i, which are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the queries, ensuring that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.**
