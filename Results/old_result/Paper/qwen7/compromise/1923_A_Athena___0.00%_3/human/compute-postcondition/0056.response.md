Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with the last element being -1, `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Initially, the last element of `a` is 0. After executing `a.pop()`, the last element of `a` becomes -1 (assuming the list had at least one element). The values of `res`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
