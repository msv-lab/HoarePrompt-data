Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 0, `i` is the index of the last remaining element in the list `a` after all leading zeros have been removed, `len(a)` is the length of the list `a` with all leading zeros removed, and `t` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the start of the list `a` as long as they are zeros. After executing the loop until it can no longer remove any leading zeros, the value of `res` remains unchanged at 0, `i` will be the index of the last element in the modified list `a`, `len(a)` will be the length of the list after all leading zeros have been removed, and `t` remains at 0 since it is not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is 0, `i` is the index of the last remaining element in the list `a` after all leading zeros have been removed, `len(a)` is the length of the list `a` with all leading zeros removed minus one, and `t` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `res` is 0, `i` is the index of the last remaining element in the list `a` after all leading zeros have been removed, `len(a)` is the length of the list `a` with all leading zeros removed minus one, and `t` is 0, with the last element of `a` being removed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `res` is 0, `i` is the index of the last remaining element in the list `a` after all leading zeros have been removed, and the length of `a` is decreased by 1, and `a[-1]` is now 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
