Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with its first element being 2, `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Initially, `a` has its first element as 1. After popping the first element, the first element of `a` becomes the second element, which is 2. All other variables (`res`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
