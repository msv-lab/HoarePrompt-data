Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with its last element being a value other than 0, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0 before the pop operation, after executing `a.pop()`, the last element of `a` will be a value other than 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
