Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`.
2. **Analyze the Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the first element of `a` is `0` (`a[0] == 0`).
3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `res` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers formed from the input split.
   - `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop.

4. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `a` and `a[0]`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `a` must not be empty and `a[0]` must be `0`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `a` is a list, it must not be empty.
   - The first element of `a` must be `0`.

Given these points, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and the first element of `a` must be 0, `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop**
