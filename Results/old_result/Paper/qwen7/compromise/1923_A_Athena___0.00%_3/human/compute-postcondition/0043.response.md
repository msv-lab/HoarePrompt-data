Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with its first element removed, `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` was 0, it is no longer in the list. All other variables (`res`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
