Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers formed from the input split, `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop**.

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
