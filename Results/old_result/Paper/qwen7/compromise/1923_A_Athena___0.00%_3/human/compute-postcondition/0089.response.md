Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is the index of the last remaining element in the list `a` after all leading zeros have been removed, `len(a)` is the length of the list `a` with all leading zeros removed minus one, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was guaranteed to be zero, removing it does not affect the conditions that `res`, `i`, and `t` must satisfy. The length of the list `a` is reduced by one, but `i` remains the index of the last remaining element in the updated list `a`.
