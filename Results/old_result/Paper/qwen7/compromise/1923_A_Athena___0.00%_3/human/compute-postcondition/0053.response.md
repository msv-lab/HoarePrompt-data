Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with the last element being a value other than 0, `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Initially, the last element of `a` was 0, but after executing `a.pop()`, the last element is no longer 0. All other variables (`res`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
