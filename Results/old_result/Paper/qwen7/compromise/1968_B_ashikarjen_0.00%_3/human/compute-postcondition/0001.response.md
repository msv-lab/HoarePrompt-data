Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string obtained from the input.**

The code `a = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since `t` and `m` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The value of `a` is a string representation of the input provided by the user, which could be converted to an integer if needed later in the program.
