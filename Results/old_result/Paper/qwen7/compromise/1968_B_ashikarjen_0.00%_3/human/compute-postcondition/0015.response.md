Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[2]`) must not be equal to `a[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a string input by the user, `k` is 1, and the condition `j < m` is true.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions and values.
