Output State: **`j` is `j + 5`, `b[m-1]` (which is `b[j-2]`) does not equal `a[i]`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `j` is `j + 4`. The code `j += 1` increments `j` by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes `j + 5`. The condition `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `b` or `a`. Thus, the updated state is that `j` is now `j + 5` and the condition about `b[m-1]` (which is `b[j-2]`) not being equal to `a[i]` still holds.
