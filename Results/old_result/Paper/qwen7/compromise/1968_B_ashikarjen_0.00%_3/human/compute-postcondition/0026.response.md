Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `m` is greater than `j`, `b[j]` (which is `b[m-1]`) must not equal `a[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The condition that `j` must be less than `m` is still valid, so `m` must be greater than the new value of `j`. Additionally, the condition that `b[j]` (which is `b[m-1]`) must not equal `a[i]` remains unchanged.
