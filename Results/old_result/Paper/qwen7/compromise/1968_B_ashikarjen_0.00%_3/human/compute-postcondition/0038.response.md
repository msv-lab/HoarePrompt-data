Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.

2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `j < m`: This checks if `j` is less than `m`.
   - `b[j] != a[i]`: This checks if the character at index `j` in the string `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in the string `a`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `j` is equal to `m`.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a string obtained from the input.
   - `b` is a user input string.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - For `j < m` to be true, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` is currently equal to `m`, we need to decrement `j` by 1 so that `j` is less than `m`.
   - For `b[j] != a[i]` to be true, `b[j]` must not equal `a[i]`. Since `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, this condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` being equal to `m`. We need to change `j` to be less than `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, and `i` is `i + 1`**
