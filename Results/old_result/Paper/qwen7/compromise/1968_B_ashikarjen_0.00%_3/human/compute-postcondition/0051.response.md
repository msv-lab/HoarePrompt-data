Postcondition: `j` is equal to `m`, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, `i` is `i + 1`, and either `k` is increased by 1 or the most internal loop or if statement is broken, depending on whether the condition `j < m` is true or false.
