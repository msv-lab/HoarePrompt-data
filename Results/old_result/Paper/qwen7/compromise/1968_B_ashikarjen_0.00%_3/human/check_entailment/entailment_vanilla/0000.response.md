### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Loop Through String `a`**: The function iterates through each character of string `a` using a `for` loop. For each character in `a`, it tries to find a matching character in `b`.

3. **Finding Matching Characters**: Inside the loop, there is a `while` loop that searches for the current character of `a` in `b`. If found, it increments the counter `k` and moves to the next character in both `a` and `b`.

4. **Handling Mismatch**: If the character of `a` is not found in `b` within the bounds of `b`, the loop breaks, and the function prints the value of `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all characters of `a` are found in `b` in order, `k` will be equal to the length of `a`.
   - If no characters of `a` are found in `b`, `k` will be 0.
   - The function handles the case where `j` exceeds the length of `b` by breaking the loop.

6. **Output**: The function correctly outputs the value of `k` for each test case.

Given the logic and the handling of edge cases, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
