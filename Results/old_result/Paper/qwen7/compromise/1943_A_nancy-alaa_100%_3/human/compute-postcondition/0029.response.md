Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
