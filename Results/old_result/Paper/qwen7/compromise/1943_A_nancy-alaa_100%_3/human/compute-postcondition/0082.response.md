Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, then `i` remains the same and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the only outcome is that `i` remains unchanged and the condition of breaking out of the loop or if statement is met if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`.
