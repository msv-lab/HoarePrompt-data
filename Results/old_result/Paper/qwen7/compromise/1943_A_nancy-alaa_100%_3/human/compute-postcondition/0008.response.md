Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no variables are updated or reassigned by the `break` statement, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
