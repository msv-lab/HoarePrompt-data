Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables.
