Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and if the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, the program continues as normal without any changes to `first`, `i`, or `n`.
