Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` must remain the same since it is not modified within the loop body (no information given that it would change).

Given these points, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted for `i` to be 2 and `n` to remain greater than or equal to 0.

**State: **`first` remains False, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
