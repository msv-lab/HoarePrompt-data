Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n`, `first` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
