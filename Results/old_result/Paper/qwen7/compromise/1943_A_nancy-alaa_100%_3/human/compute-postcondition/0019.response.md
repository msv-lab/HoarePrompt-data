Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `first` remains False
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(n + 1)`.
   - This means the loop will run as long as `i < n + 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if mpp[i] == 1:` will be checked.
   - Since `i` is now 1, we need to check if `mpp[1]` is equal to 1.
   - If `mpp[1]` is equal to 1, then `first` will remain False (as per the given condition).

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `first` will remain False unless `mpp[1]` is 1, but since no change is mentioned, it remains False.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`first` remains False, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
