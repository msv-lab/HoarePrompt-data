Output State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` remains the same, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of `first`, `i`, or `n`. It simply indicates that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional structure.
