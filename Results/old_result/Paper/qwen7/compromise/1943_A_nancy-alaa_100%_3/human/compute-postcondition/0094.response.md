Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by mapping the `int` function to each element of the input split by spaces. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, it remains unchanged. The new list `arr` contains integers that were input by the user.
