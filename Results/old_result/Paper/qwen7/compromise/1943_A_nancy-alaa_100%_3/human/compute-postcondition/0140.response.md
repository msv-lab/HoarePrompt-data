Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of an integer t, followed by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. It returns information based on the input test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer t, which indicates the number of test cases, followed by the details of each test case including n and an array a. However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters, the description focuses on the nature of the input and expected output without detailing the internal processing steps.
