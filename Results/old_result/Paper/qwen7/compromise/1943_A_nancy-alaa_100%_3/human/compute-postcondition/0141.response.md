Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it prints the first missing positive integer in the array or the first integer \( i \) for which there is exactly one occurrence in the array and the flag `first` has already been set to `True`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything but prints the results directly.**
