Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the field dimensions `n` and `m`, and it correctly identifies players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle.
2. **Player Movements and Actions**: The program handles player movements and actions (catching and throwing the Quaffle) correctly. It updates the positions of players and the Quaffle appropriately.
3. **Elimination Logic**: When a player is eliminated due to a Bludger, the program correctly prints the elimination event and updates the Quaffle's position if necessary.
4. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly identifies when a player scores and updates the scores accordingly. It also correctly prints the "RED GOAL" or "BLUE GOAL" events.
5. **Final Score**: The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.
6. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the new position of a player given a direction (dx, dy).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly based on the provided annotations and examples.

Correctness: **True**
