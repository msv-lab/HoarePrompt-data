Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1`, `ans` now contains `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contained the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. After appending, `ans` now contains a list with one element, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The value of `j` remains unchanged as `adv - 1`.
