Output State: **`j` is `0`, `ans` now contains a list of elements starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `adv`.
- After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
- Since `adv` is the value of `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` and remains constant throughout the loop's execution, the loop will run exactly `adv` times.
- Each iteration appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans`.
- After `adv` iterations, `j` will be `adv - 1`.
- Therefore, `ans` will contain the sequence of numbers starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - 1`.
