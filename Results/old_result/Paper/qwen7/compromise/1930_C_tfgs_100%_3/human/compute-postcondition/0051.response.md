Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `adv`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `adv`**:
   - The loop starts with `j` being set to `adv - 1`.
   - The value of `adv` is defined as `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is non-negative. Therefore, `j` must be initialized to a non-negative value.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` should be set to `adv - 1`.
   - `adv` should be set to its defined value `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `counter`, `a`, `ans`, `i`, `a[i+1]`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be `adv - 1`.
- `adv` should be `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `j` is `adv - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`**
