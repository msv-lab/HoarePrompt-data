Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(cnt)`. The key variable here is `cnt`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be greater than 0.
   - The state of `ans` does not change based on the loop head; it is affected by the loop body, which is omitted in this context.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt`, which must remain greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.**
