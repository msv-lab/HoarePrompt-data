Output State: **`cur` is equal to `cur` + `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv + 1`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `adv` is equal to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 1`, `ans` now includes all elements from `a[i+1]` up to `a[i-1] - (adv - 1) - 1` appended to it, `j` is `adv - 1`, `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cur += counter[a[i]]` updates the value of `cur` by adding the value of `counter[a[i]]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state, except for `cur` which is updated.
