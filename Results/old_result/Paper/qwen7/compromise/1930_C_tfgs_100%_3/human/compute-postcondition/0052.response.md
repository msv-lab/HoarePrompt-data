Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `adv`. These are the only variables that need to be considered for adjustment.

2. **Determine Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being set to `adv - 1`. Therefore, `j` should be initialized to `adv - 1`.

3. **Determine Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is non-negative. So, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust Other States**: The other states mentioned (like `cur`, `cnt`, `counter`, `a`, `ans`, `i`, etc.) are not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `j` should be `adv - 1`.
- `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`j` is `adv - 1`, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0**
