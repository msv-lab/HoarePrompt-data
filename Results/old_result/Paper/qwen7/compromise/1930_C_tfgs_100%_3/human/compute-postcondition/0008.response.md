Output State: The value of `i` is `n-1`; for every index `j` in the list `a` where `0 â‰¤ j < n`, the value of `a[j]` is `j + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `i` goes from 0 to `n-1`), each element `a[j]` in the list `a` will have been incremented by `j + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `a[j]` will be the initial value of `a[j]` plus `j + 1`. Since the initial values of `a[j]` are not specified, we can only say that `a[j]` becomes `j + 1` after the loop, assuming the initial values were 0 for simplicity or were already set to some other values that get incremented accordingly.
