Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1 - 1`, `ans` contains `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is updated to `adv - 2` (since `j` was originally `adv - 1` and it is decremented by 1). The value of `ans` is updated to include `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `a[i - 1] - adv`. The conditions that `j` must be greater than or equal to 0 remain valid, but since `j` is now `adv - 2`, this condition is only valid if `adv >= 2`. However, the exact value of `adv` is not specified, so we keep it in the form `adv - 2`.
