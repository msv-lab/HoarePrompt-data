Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` has gone through every index of the list `a`. At this point, `cur` will be equal to the sum of `counter[a[i]]` for all remaining elements in `a` after the loop has run. `cnt` will be 0 because it gets reduced by `adv + 1` in each iteration until there are no more elements to process. Each `counter[a[i]]` will be decremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the original list `a`. The list `ans` will contain all the elements that were appended during the loop's execution, which includes the elements specified by the conditions in the loop body and the direct append of `a[i]` in each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `cur` will hold the sum of the decremented counts of all elements in `a`, `cnt` will be 0, `counter` will reflect the decremented counts of each element, and `ans` will be a list containing all the elements specified by the loop's logic.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list where the last element is now equal to the second last element minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list where the last element is now equal to the third last element minus 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
