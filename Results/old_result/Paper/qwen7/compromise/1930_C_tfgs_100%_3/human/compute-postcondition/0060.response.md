Output State: **`j` is 0; `cnt` is `cnt` minus `adv`; `cur` is `cur` minus `adv`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is decremented by the value of `adv`. The initial state of `j` is 0, and `cnt` is `cnt` minus `adv`. Therefore, after executing `cur -= adv`, `cur` is updated to its previous value minus `adv`. The other variables remain unchanged.
