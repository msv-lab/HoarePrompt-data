Postcondition: **`cur` is decreased by `adv`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv + 1`, `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1, `adv` is equal to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 1`, `ans` now includes all elements from `a[i+1]` up to `a[i-1] - (adv - 1) - 1` appended to it, `j` is `adv - 1`, and `ans.append(a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1)` appends the final element to `ans`.**
