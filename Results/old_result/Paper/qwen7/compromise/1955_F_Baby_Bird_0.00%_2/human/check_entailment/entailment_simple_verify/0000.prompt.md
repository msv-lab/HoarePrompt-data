You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, there are four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers, each representing the result of the print statement for each test case. For each test case, the result is either 0 or 1 plus the sum of the elements in the list `p` divided by 2. The value 0 or 1 is determined by whether the first three elements of the list `p` (representing counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s) are all odd, and then adding the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.
    #
    #For example, if the input for a test case is "3" followed by "1 2 3 4", the list `p` would be [1, 2, 3, 4]. The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` evaluates to 0 because not all of the first three elements are odd. Then, `sum(p) // 2` is `10 // 2`, which is 5. So the output for this test case would be `5`.
    #
    #Output State: A series of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 plus the sum of the elements in the list `p` divided by 2 for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the sum of the counts of odd numbers in the first three elements (ones, twos, and threes) and checks if this sum equals 3, which is not relevant to the problem. Additionally, the program incorrectly calculates the division of the sum of all counts by 2.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the counts of ones, twos, and threes. The key observation is that Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero, which happens if the count of ones, twos, and threes is even. Therefore, Eve should remove numbers to make these counts even.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ones, twos, threes, fours = p[0], p[1], p[2], p[3]
        
        # Calculate the total number of moves
        total_moves = ones + twos + threes + fours
        
        # Calculate the number of moves needed to make the counts of ones, twos, and threes even
        moves_to_even = (ones + twos + threes) % 2
        
        # The remaining moves are for Bob to win
        bob_wins = total_moves - moves_to_even
        
        print(bob_wins)


func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring the counts of ones, twos, and threes are even after each move.
