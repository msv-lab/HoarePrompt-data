Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero after each removal by Eve.

2. **Key Logic**: 
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers that keep the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers as close to zero as possible.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then processes these counts using the following logic:
     - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` is unnecessary since the input is already split and converted to integers.
     - The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd.
     - `sum(p) // 2` calculates half the total count of numbers (integer division).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd is incorrect. This does not directly relate to the bitwise XOR condition.
   - The calculation `sum(p) // 2` is also not relevant to the problem's requirement of maximizing Bob's wins based on the bitwise XOR condition.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
   - If the count of 1s, 2s, and 3s is all odd, Bob can win once.
   - Otherwise, Bob cannot win initially.
   - For each subsequent removal, Bob can win if the remaining numbers' XOR is zero.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
