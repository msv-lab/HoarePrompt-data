Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers, each representing the result of the expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` for each test case. Each test case is defined by four non-negative integers \(p_i\) (0 ≤ \(p_i\) ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. The loop processes each test case, and the results are printed for each iteration.
