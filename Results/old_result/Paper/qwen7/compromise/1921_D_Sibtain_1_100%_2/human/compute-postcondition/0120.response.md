Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `k` is less than the length of `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 1
   - `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`
   - `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`
   - `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`
   - `i` is increased by 1 if `t2` is not greater than `t1`, otherwise `j` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `k`, we need to increment `k` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` depend on the values of `i` and `j`, which are determined within the loop body. However, these values are not directly modified in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `k` should be incremented by 1 from its current value of 1 to 2.
   - The values of `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because they are not directly modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`**
