Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input, `c` is sorted in descending order.**

The code `c.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `c` in descending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
