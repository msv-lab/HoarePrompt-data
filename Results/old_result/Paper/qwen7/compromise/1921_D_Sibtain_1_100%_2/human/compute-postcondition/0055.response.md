Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input, and if the lengths of sets `a` and `c` are both 1 and their only elements are equal, the function continues with the current values of `ans`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`. If the condition is not met, the function also continues with the same values of `ans`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`.
