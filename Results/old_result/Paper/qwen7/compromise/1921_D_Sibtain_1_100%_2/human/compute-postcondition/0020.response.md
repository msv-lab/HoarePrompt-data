Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`**

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `c`. The indices used are `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, where `j` is initially 1. Therefore, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
