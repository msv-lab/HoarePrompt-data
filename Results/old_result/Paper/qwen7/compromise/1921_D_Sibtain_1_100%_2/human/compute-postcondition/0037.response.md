Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for k in range(len(a))`. The only variable in the loop head is `k`.

2. **Determine the current state of `k`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `len(a)`. Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `k` would be 2.

4. **Adjust the state of `k`**: To allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be set to 2.

5. **Check if other variables need adjustment**: The variables `i`, `j`, `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop itself. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

Based on this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(`t1`, `t2`) + max(`t1`, `t2`), `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])**
