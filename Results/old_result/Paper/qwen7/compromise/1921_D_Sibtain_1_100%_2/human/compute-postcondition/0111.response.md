Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += max(t1, t2)` adds the maximum value between `t1` and `t2` to `ans`. The values of `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The condition for incrementing `j` or `i` does not affect the current state since the code only updates `ans` and does not modify `j` or `i` directly.
