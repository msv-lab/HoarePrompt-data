Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order, `len(a)` must be at least 4, and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions and relationships between these variables also remain valid as per the initial state.
