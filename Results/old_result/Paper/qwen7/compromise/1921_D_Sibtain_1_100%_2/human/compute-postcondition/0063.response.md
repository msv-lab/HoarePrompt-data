Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `k` is 3; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input; `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order; `len(a)` must be at least 4.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to be the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` are preserved.
