Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input, and if the set of `a` and `c` both contain exactly one unique element and the first elements of `a` and `c` are equal, then the function does not change the values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`.
