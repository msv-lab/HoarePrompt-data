Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input.
- `m` is an integer obtained from the second input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by spaces, and it contains only one unique element.
- `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by spaces, and it contains only one unique element.
- The first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.

The print statement is simply `print(0)`. This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`, the output will always be `0`.

Output: **0**
