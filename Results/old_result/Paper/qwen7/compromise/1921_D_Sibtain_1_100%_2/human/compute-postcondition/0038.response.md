Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(`t1`, `t2`) + max(`t1`, `t2`), `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])**.

Explanation: The code updates `t1` to `abs(a[i] - c[i])`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `t1` becomes `abs(a[1] - c[1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
