Postcondition: `i` is either 0, 1, 1, or 2; `j` is either 1, 2, 2, or 3; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)` + max(`abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`); `k` is 5; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is updated to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input; `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order; and `len(a)` must be at least 4.
