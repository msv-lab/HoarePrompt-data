The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It then constructs a list \( ans \) based on the binary representation of \( k \). The list \( ans \) contains powers of 2 corresponding to the bits set in \( k \), followed by zeros to ensure the list has a total length of \( n \). Finally, it prints the constructed list for each test case.
