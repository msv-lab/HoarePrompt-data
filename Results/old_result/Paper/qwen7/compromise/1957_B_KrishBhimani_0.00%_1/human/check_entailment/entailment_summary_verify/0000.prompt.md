You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It then constructs a list \( ans \) based on the binary representation of \( k \). The list \( ans \) contains powers of 2 corresponding to the bits set in \( k \), followed by zeros to ensure the list has a total length of \( n \). Finally, it prints the constructed list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. In such cases, it is impossible to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` because the minimum possible sum would be 0 (if all elements are 0), which is less than `k` when `k > 0`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 1
```

The program will generate a sequence `[1, 0, 0]`, but the bitwise OR of this sequence is `1 | 0 | 0 = 1`, which does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation since `1` itself can be represented as `(1)` in binary, which has only one 1. However, the optimal solution would be `[1, 0, 0]` with a bitwise OR result of `1`, which already has one 1, and no other sequence of three non-negative integers can achieve more 1s in the bitwise OR result given the constraint `k=1`.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
