The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero (i.e., `k` is True), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is not specified directly, but we know that the loop continued based on the given information. Since no specific value for `k` is mentioned, we cannot assume any particular value for `k` other than it being non-zero.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be non-zero.

State: **`i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` must be non-zero**
