Output State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` is the original value of `k` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, which effectively divides `k` by 2. Since the initial condition was that `k & 1 == 1` (meaning `k` is odd), the right shift operation does not change the fact that `k` must remain non-zero. The other variables (`i`, `arr`, `c`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.
