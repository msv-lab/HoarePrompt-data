Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `l1`. The precondition that `t` must be a positive integer between \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains unchanged, but now `l1` contains the split input as a list of strings.
