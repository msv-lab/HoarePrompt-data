Output State: **`i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is a list containing the value `1`. The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends `0` to `ans` for each missing element needed to make its length equal to `n`. Since `n` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, we infer that `n` is the length of `ans` after the loop, which is 1. Therefore, no elements are appended to `ans` because `(n - len(ans))` equals `0`. As a result, `ans` remains as `[1]`. All other variables (`i`, `arr`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
