Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
   - `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1, (1 << i), ..., -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)].
   - `c` is 16.
   - `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.
   - The list `ans` is defined as follows: [0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1, (1 << i), ..., -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)].
     - Here, `(1 << (i - 1))` means shifting 1 left by `(i - 1)` bits.
     - Similarly, `(1 << i)` means shifting 1 left by `i` bits.
   - The list `ans` is then extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`, which adds zeros to the end of `ans` until its length equals `n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `i` can be any value from 0 to 15, let's consider the general form of `ans`:
     - For example, if `i = 0`, `ans` would be [0, 1, -1, 0, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0] (with `n - 17` zeros added).
     - If `i = 15`, `ans` would be [0, 1, -1, 32768, -1, 65536, -1, 131072, -1, 262144, -1, 524288, -1, 1048576, -1, 2097152, -1, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0] (with `n - 17` zeros added).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact output depends on the value of `i` and `n`, but the general form will be a list starting with [0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1, (1 << i), ..., -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], followed by `n - 17` zeros.

Output: **[0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1, (1 << i), ..., -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)] followed by [0] * (n - 17)**
