Output State: **`i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the value [0], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` is the current value of `k` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, which is equivalent to dividing `k` by 2 and truncating the result to an integer. Since `k` was initially an odd number, after the operation, `k` will be an even number (half of the original value). All other variables remain unchanged.
