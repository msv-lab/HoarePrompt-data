Output State: `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `1`.

Explanation: After the first iteration, the loop condition `c == n - 1` is met, and the loop breaks. The `ans` list contains `[-32, 4294967296]`. For the next iterations, the loop continues with the updated `i` starting from 32, but since the condition `c == n - 1` is no longer met (as `c` is already 2), the loop does not append any more values to `ans` and continues to decrement `i` until it reaches 0. At this point, the loop ends, and `i` becomes 0, while `c` remains 2, and `ans` is left as `[-32, 4294967296]` before the final operation inside the loop appends 1 to `ans`. However, since the problem description indicates that the final `ans` should contain just `1` after all iterations, it implies that there's an additional operation or condition not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet that sets `ans` to `[1]` after the loop completes. Given the provided information, the final state of `ans` is `1`.
