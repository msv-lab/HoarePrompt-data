Output State: **`i` is 5, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (0 - 1)), -1, (1 << 0), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16, `k0` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is right-shifted by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 4, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 5. The values of other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
