Output State: **`i` is 32, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `ans` is a list containing the value `-32`**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` is trying to append a value to the list `ans`. However, the variables `k0` and `ans` are not defined in the given initial state. Assuming `k0` is intended to be `i` (which is 32), and `ans` is initially an empty list, the code calculates `32 - sum([])`, which is `32 - 0` and appends `32` to `ans`. But since the code snippet does not show the definition of `k0`, we cannot determine the exact value appended. Given the typical context, if `k0` was meant to be `i`, then `ans` would be updated to contain `-32`. However, without explicit definition, the most accurate representation based on the given information is that `ans` contains `-32`.
