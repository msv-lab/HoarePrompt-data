Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
