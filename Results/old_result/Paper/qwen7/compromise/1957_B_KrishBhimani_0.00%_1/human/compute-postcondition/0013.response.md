Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is now equal to `k0 // 2`, and `arr` is a list containing the value 0.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
