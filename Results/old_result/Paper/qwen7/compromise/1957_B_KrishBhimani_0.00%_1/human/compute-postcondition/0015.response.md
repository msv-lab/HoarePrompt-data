Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0 and 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. Therefore, `arr` now contains both the original value 0 and the new value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
