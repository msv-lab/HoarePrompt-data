Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is `k // 2`, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0 and 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` shifts the bits of `k` to the right by one position, which is equivalent to dividing `k` by 2 and taking the integer part. Since the initial condition states that `k` is an even number and if `k` is odd, it is updated to `k // 2`, the operation `k = k >> 1` effectively performs the same division by 2 operation, making `k` half of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
