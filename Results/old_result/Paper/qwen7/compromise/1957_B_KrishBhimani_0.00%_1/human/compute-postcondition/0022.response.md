Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer greater than 0 and now equal to `k // 2`, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0 and 1. If `k` is odd, `i` remains 2. There is no change in the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` in the else part since no other operations are specified.
