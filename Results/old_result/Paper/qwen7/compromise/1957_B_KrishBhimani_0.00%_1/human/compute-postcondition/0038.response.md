Output State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, k - 1], `c` is 1**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `ans` is a list containing the values `[0, 1]`.
- The code appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans`. Since `k` is 0 and `sum(ans)` is `0 + 1 = 1`, `k - sum(ans)` is `0 - 1 = -1`.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes `[0, 1, -1]`.

However, the provided code snippet contains a typo (`k0` instead of `k`), which would cause a NameError. Assuming the intention was to append `k - sum(ans)`, the updated `ans` list is `[0, 1, -1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
