Output State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, `ans` is a list containing the value `-sum(ans)`, `c` is 0, and the current value of `c` is equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Since `k` is initially 0 and `ans` is initially an empty list, `sum(ans)` is 0. Therefore, `k - sum(ans)` is `0 - 0`, which is 0. So, `ans` now contains the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
