Output State: `i` is 32, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero. Given that the loop executes up to the 32nd iteration (as indicated by the final state after 3 iterations), `k` must have been initially set to a value such that its binary representation has at least 5 bits (since \(2^5 = 32\)). After 32 iterations, `i` would be 32, and `arr` would contain all integers from 0 to 31 because every odd `k` value appends the corresponding `i` to `arr`. Since `k` is right-shifted each iteration, it eventually becomes 0 after 32 iterations, terminating the loop.
