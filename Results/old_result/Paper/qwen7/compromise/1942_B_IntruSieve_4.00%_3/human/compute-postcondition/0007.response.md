Output State: `minn` is the maximum value in `mex` plus one, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing elements from `minn` or differences between `arr[i]` and `minn`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in `mex`.
