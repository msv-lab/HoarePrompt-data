Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts from 0 and increments until it reaches `n`.

Given the initial states:
- `minn` is 0
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
- `mex` is an empty list
- `maxx` is 0

We need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusted States:

- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
