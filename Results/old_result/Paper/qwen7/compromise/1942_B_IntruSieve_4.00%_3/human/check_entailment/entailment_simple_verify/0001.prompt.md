You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `mex` (to store MEX values), `minn` (to keep track of the smallest unused integer), and `maxx` (to keep track of the largest integer seen).

3. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element in the array `arr`, it checks if the value is positive.
     - If positive, it calculates the MEX as `minn` and increments `minn`.
     - If the current `minn` equals `maxx`, it updates `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
   - If the value is negative, it calculates the MEX as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and updates `maxx` if necessary.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the calculated MEX values for each element.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Example 1:
Given input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 5`
  - `arr = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - `mex` calculation:
    - `i = 0`: `arr[0] = 1` (positive), `mex[0] = 0`, `minn = 1`
    - `i = 1`: `arr[1] = 1` (positive), `mex[1] = 0`, `minn = 2`
    - `i = 2`: `arr[2] = -2` (negative), `mex[2] = 2`, `maxx = 2`
    - `i = 3`: `arr[3] = 1` (positive), `mex[3] = 0`, `minn = 3`
    - `i = 4`: `arr[4] = 2` (positive), `mex[4] = 0`, `minn = 4`
  - Output: `0 0 2 0 0`

This does not match the expected output `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`. The program incorrectly handles the MEX calculation and does not produce the correct permutation.

#### Example 2:
Given input:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```

- **Test Case 2**:
  - `n = 5`
  - `arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `mex` calculation:
    - `i = 0`: `arr[0] = 1` (positive), `mex[0] = 0`, `minn = 1`
    - `i = 1`: `arr[1] = 1` (positive), `mex[1] = 0`, `minn = 2`
    - `i = 2`: `arr[2] = 1` (positive), `mex[2] = 0`, `minn = 3`
    - `i = 3`: `arr[3] = 1` (positive), `mex[3] = 0`, `minn = 4`
    - `i = 4`: `arr[4] = 1` (positive), `mex[4] = 0`, `minn = 5`
  - Output: `0 0 0 0 0`

This also does not match the expected output `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. The program again incorrectly handles the MEX calculation and does not produce the correct permutation.

#### Example 3:
Given input:
```
3
-2 1 2
```

- **Test Case 3**:
  - `n = 3`
  - `arr = [-2, 1, 2]`
  - `mex` calculation:
    - `i = 0`: `arr[0] = -2` (negative), `mex[0] = 2`, `maxx = 2`
    - `i = 1`: `arr[1] = 1` (positive), `mex[1] = 0`, `minn = 1`
    - `i = 2`: `arr[2] = 2` (positive), `mex[2] = 0`, `minn = 2`
  - Output: `2 0 0`

This does not match the expected output `[2, 0, 1]`. The program again incorrectly handles the MEX calculation and does not produce the correct permutation.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the MEX values and thus does not generate the correct permutation `p` for the given array `a`.
