Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1()` is supposed to generate a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` such that the condition \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\) holds for all \(i\). However, the current implementation of `func_1()` does not actually generate such a permutation `p`. Instead, it generates a list `mex` which does not correspond to the required permutation.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The function calculates `mex` based on the positive elements in `arr`, but this does not align with the problem statement. The MEX should be calculated based on the elements of the permutation `p` being constructed, not just the positive elements of `arr`.

2. **No Construction of Permutation `p`**: The function does not construct the permutation `p` at all. It only prints a list `mex` which is not related to the required permutation.

3. **Missing Logic for Constructing `p`**: There is no logic in the function to ensure that the generated `p` satisfies the condition \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\).

Given these points, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
