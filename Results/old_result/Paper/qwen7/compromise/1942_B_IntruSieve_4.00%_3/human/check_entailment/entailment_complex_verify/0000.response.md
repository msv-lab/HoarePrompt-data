### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and verify the original assessment.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function takes an integer `n` and an array `arr` of length `n`.
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and constructs the `mex` list based on the following rules:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn` by 1.
     - If `arr[i]` is negative, it appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `mex`.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The function does not actually construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
   - The logic for calculating the MEX value and constructing the permutation is indeed flawed.

#### Example Walkthrough:

Given the input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

- **Step 1**: Initialize `n = 5` and `arr = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`.
- **Step 2**: Initialize `minn = 0` and `maxx = 0`.
- **Step 3**: Iterate through `arr`:
  - `i = 0`: `arr[0] = 1` (positive), so `mex.append(0)` and `minn = 1`.
  - `i = 1`: `arr[1] = 1` (positive), so `mex.append(1)` and `minn = 2`.
  - `i = 2`: `arr[2] = -2` (negative), so `mex.append(abs(-2 - 2)) = 4` and `maxx = 4`.
  - `i = 3`: `arr[3] = 1` (positive), so `mex.append(3)` and `minn = 4`.
  - `i = 4`: `arr[4] = 2` (positive), so `mex.append(5)` and `minn = 6`.

Thus, the `mex` list becomes `[0, 1, 4, 3, 5]`.

- **Step 4**: Print the elements of `mex`: `0 1 4 3 5`.

#### Verification Against Expected Output:

The expected output should be a permutation `p` such that:
- \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1) - p_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2) - p_2 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3) - p_3 = -2 \)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) - p_4 = 1 \)
- \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5) - p_5 = 2 \)

A valid permutation `p` could be `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which satisfies the conditions:
- \( \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \)
- \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \)
- \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2 \)
- \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1 \)
- \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2 \)

However, the program does not generate this permutation. Instead, it generates `[0, 1, 4, 3, 5]`, which does not satisfy the conditions.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
