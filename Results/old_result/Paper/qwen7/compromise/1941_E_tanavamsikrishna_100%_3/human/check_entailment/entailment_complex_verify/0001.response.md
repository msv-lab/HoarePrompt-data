### Reasoning:

Let's break down the solution step by step to verify its correctness.

#### Understanding `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of 1 and 2 respectively. This is done to ensure that the first and last supports are placed correctly.
   - For example, if `d = 5`, the row will be initialized as `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.

2. **Min-Heap Usage**:
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` from the current position.
   - The heap is updated as the function iterates through the rest of the row, ensuring that the distance condition is met.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each element in the row starting from index `d`, the function pops the smallest element from the heap, checks if the distance condition is met, and updates the cost accordingly.
   - The function then pushes the updated cost back into the heap.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the cost of placing the last support in the row.

#### Understanding `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for a single test case, including the dimensions of the river and the number of bridges to be built.
   - It also reads the depths of the river cells for each row.

2. **Calculating Costs**:
   - For each row, the function calls `func_1` to get the minimum cost of placing supports.
   - These costs are stored in the `costs` list.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
   - It does this by iterating through the `costs` list and summing every `k` consecutive elements.

4. **Finding Minimum Total Cost**:
   - The function finds the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows and prints it.

#### Verification of `func_1`:
- The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements of the row.
- It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` from the current position.
- The logic for updating the cost of placing supports ensures that the distance condition is met.
- The function correctly returns the cost of placing the last support in the row.

#### Verification of `func_2`:
- The function correctly reads the input for a single test case.
- It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports.
- It calculates the total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
- The function correctly prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of placing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work as intended and handle the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
