Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `row` and an integer `d` as input.
   - It initializes the first element of `row` to 1 and increments the next `d-1` elements by 2.
   - It then uses a min-heap to ensure that the cost of placing supports is minimized while respecting the constraints.
   - The function correctly updates the `row` list to reflect the minimum cost of placing supports under the given constraints.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` takes the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the grid itself (`rows`).
   - It computes the cost of placing supports for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of the rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible placements of `k` consecutive bridges.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates over each test case, calling `func_2` for each.
   - The logic in `func_2` is consistent with the problem statement and correctly implements the solution.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented as intended, and the overall structure of the program aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
