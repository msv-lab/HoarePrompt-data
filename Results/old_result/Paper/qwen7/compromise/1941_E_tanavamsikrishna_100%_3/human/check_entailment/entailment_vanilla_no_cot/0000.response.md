To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and correctness of the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Analysis of `func_1`

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting the first element of the row to 1.
2. **Initial Cost Calculation**: For the first `d` elements, it adds 2 to each element's value.
3. **Heap Initialization**: It initializes a min-heap with the first `d` elements of the row.
4. **Heap Processing**: For each subsequent element in the row, it removes the smallest element from the heap that is within the required distance (`d + 2`) and updates the current element's cost accordingly. It then reinserts the updated element into the heap.

This function aims to find the minimum cost to place supports under the constraints given. However, there are a few issues with the logic:
- The initial cost calculation for the first `d` elements should be `a[i] + 1`, not `a[i] + 2`.
- The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):` is incorrect. It should be `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] < i - d:` to ensure the distance constraint is correctly applied.

### Analysis of `func_2`

1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the dimensions and the grid of the river.
2. **Cost Calculation**: It calculates the cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It computes the minimum total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

The logic here is generally correct, but it assumes that `func_1` is correctly implemented. Given the issues identified in `func_1`, the overall correctness of the program is affected.

### Conclusion

Since `func_1` has logical errors that affect its correctness, the entire program cannot be considered correct.

**Correctness: False**
