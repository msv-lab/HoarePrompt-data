Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not designed to handle the constraints and requirements of the problem statement. The function aims to calculate the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row, but it does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Additionally, the function does not account for the requirement that a support must be installed in both the first and last columns of the row.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```

Expected output:
```
4
```

However, the program's output for this case would be incorrect because it does not properly place supports according to the given constraints. The correct placement of supports would be as follows:

- For the first row: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`
- For the second row: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`
- For the third row: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`

The minimum cost for the first row is 4, which matches the expected output. However, the program fails to correctly calculate this cost due to its flawed logic.
