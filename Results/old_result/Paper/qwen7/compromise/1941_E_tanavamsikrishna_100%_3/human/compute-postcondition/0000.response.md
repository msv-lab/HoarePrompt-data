Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 3 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ `d` ≤ `m`; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. These values replace the existing placeholders for these variables, but the constraints and the structure of `rows` remain unchanged.
