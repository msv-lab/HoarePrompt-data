Based on the initial state provided, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every consecutive `k` elements from the `costs` list, starting from the first element and ending at the second-to-last element of the `costs` list. This means that if the `costs` list has `n` elements, `total_costs` will contain `n - (k - 1)` sums, each representing the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the minimum value among these sums. Since the exact `costs` list is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, we know that `min(total_costs)` will be the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum value among the sums of every consecutive `k` elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs contains the sums of every consecutive k elements from the costs list)**
