Output State: `i` is `d-1`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the second element is less than or equal to `-d-2`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Given that `i` starts at `d-1` and remains unchanged throughout the loop, the condition simplifies to checking if the second element of the tuple is less than or equal to `-d-2`. After each iteration, the condition is met with a more negative value, ensuring that the loop will terminate when no such tuple exists in `min_heap` anymore. Therefore, after all iterations, the `min_heap` will only contain tuples where the second element is less than or equal to `-d-2`.
