Output State: **`total_costs` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line of code `total_costs = []` initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. This operation does not affect the values of `rows` or `costs`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `total_costs` list, which is initially empty.
