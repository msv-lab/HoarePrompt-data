The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, which are all integers. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `rows`, which is a list of `n` lists. Each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0. 

The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information. However, based on the constraints, it seems the function might process the `rows` list and perform some operations related to the river cell depths.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` (all integers) and a list `rows` of `n` lists. Each inner list in `rows` contains `m` positive integers representing river cell depths, with the first and last elements being 0. The function processes this data but does not explicitly return a value.**
