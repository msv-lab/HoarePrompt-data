Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` space-separated integers, and assigns these integers to the corresponding positions in the `rows` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the values obtained from the input split by spaces. The conditions on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain valid as they are derived from the input.
