Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row; `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `costs` by applying the function `func_1(row, d)` to each row in the `rows` list. The function `func_1` is applied to each row with the parameter `d`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged from their input values. The `rows` list remains intact, but now there is a new list `costs` that contains the results of applying `func_1` to each row.
