Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if the conditions for a 'STAIR' (`a < b < c`) or a 'PEAK' (`a < b > c`) are met.
4. If both conditions are not met, it prints 'NONE'.
5. The logic in the code is correctly implemented to handle all the given examples and constraints.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function appears to be correctly implemented and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
