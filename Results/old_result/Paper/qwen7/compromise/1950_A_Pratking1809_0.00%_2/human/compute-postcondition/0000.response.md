Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `q` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the input is not related to `t`. Therefore, `t` still holds the same properties as before, i.e., it is an integer between 1 and 1000.
