Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `q`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is an input integer, and `mn` is 100. However, these variables are not part of the loop head.
3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than `q`.

Given this information, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `q`.

- `i` should start from 0.
- `q` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0**
