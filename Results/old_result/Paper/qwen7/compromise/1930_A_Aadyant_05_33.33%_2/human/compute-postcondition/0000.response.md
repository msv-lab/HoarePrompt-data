Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input string, and `n` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `num = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. Since the initial value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, it remains unchanged. The variable `n` is not defined before this line of code and is not assigned any value here, so its state remains undefined.
