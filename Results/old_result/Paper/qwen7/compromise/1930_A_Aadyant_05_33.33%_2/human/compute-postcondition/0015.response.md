Output State: **`i` is 3; `a` must be a positive integer greater than 3; `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[6]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to `list2`. Given that `i` is 3, `2 * i` equals 6. Therefore, `list2` now contains the integer value of `list1[6]`. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged.
