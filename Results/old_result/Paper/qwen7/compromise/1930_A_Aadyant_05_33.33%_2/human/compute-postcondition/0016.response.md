Output State: `i` is equal to the value of `a`; `a` must be a positive integer greater than 3; `list2` contains the integer values of `list1[0]`, `list1[4]`, and `list1[6]`, up to `list1[2*a-2]`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `a`. The variable `a` must have been a positive integer greater than 3. The list `list2` will contain the integer values of every second element starting from `list1[0]` up to `list1[2*a-2]`.
