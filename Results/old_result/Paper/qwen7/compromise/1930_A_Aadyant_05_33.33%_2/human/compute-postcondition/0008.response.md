Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `num` is a positive integer, `out` is an empty list, `list1` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace (or other specified delimiters) and assigns this list to `list1`. The values of `t`, `num`, `out`, `list2`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
