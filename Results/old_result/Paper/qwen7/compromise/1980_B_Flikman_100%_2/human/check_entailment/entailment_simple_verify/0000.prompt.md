You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `removed_count` will be equal to the number of times the `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count` will be equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire list `a`. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, the final output will be 'YES'. If `removed_count` is 0, the final output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the final output will be 'MAYBE'.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, `removed_count` will reflect how many times the `favorite_value` has been removed from the top `k` elements of the sorted list, and `favorite_count` will show the total occurrences of `favorite_value` in the original list. Based on these counts, the final decision ('YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE') will be determined as described.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' when the favorite cube might not be removed in all cases. This happens because the program checks if the number of times the favorite value appears in the first `k` elements of the sorted array is equal to the total count of the favorite value in the sorted array. However, this logic is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
- Expected Output:
```
MAYBE
```
- Actual Output:
```
YES
```

In this case, after sorting, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite value `3` appears twice in the first two positions (`k=2`), but it also appears three times in the entire sorted array. Therefore, the favorite cube might or might not be removed depending on the exact positions of the other cubes. The program incorrectly prints 'YES' in this case, indicating that the favorite cube will always be removed, which is not true.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes in all possible permutations of the sorted array, not just the first `k` elements.
