Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `k-1`, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` was found in `sorted_a` up to index `k-1`, and `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `k`, `favorite_count`, `i`, and `removed_count`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The new list `a` is created based on the input provided.
