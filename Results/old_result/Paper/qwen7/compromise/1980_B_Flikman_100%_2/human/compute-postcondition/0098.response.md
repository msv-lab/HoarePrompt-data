Postcondition: `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k-1` elements of `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`. If `removed_count` is 0, the postcondition remains as initially described. If `removed_count` is greater than 0, the postcondition also remains as initially described.
