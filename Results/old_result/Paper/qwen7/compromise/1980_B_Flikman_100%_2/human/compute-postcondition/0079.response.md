Output State: **`i` is 1; `removed_count` is 2 if `sorted_a[0]` equals `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `sorted_a[0]` equals `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` was initially 1, and now it becomes 2. If `sorted_a[0]` does not equal `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` was initially 0 (or no change from its previous value), and now it remains unchanged. Since the initial value of `removed_count` is specified based on the condition involving `sorted_a[0]` and `favorite_value`, we keep that condition intact. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
