Output State: **`n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers inputted by the user, `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k`, `removed_count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`, and `t` is decremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers inputted by the user.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers input from the user, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged, as well as `favorite_count`, `i`, `removed_count`, and `t`. The variable `sorted_a` is not mentioned in the initial state and is not affected by this code. The list `a` now holds the integers input by the user.
