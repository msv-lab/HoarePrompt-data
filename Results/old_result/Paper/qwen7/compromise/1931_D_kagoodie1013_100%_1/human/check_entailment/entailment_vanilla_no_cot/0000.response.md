Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of beautiful pairs using the `func_1` function. The implementation uses a dictionary to keep track of residues, which efficiently counts the pairs that satisfy the conditions. The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem description accurately.
