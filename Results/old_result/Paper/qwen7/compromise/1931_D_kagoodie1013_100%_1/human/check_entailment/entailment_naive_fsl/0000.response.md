Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It uses a residue map to efficiently count pairs that satisfy both conditions \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The program processes each test case independently and returns the correct count of beautiful pairs for each case. Given the structure and logic of the code, it appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
