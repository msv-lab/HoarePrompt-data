Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code `r_x = -num % x` calculates the remainder of `-num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `r_x`. Since the initial values of `num` and `x` are not specified, `r_x` will be the result of the modulo operation based on those values. The states of `test_cases` and `arr` remain unchanged.
