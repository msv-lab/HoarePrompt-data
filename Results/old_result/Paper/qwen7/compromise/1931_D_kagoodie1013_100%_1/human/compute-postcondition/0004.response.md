Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `num` in `arr`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `num` in `arr`, the loop will execute if `arr` contains at least one element.
   - The initial values of `results` and `residue_map` do not affect whether the loop can execute, but they should be maintained as they are.
   - The variable `count` is not directly used in the loop head, so its value (0) does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `arr` to ensure that it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, results is an empty list, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary, arr must have at least one element**
