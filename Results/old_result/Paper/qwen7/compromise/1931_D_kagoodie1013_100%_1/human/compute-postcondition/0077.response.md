Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). It processes each test case to count the occurrences of each unique pair \((r_x, r_y)\), where \( r_x = -num \mod x \) and \( r_y = num \mod y \) for each element \( num \) in the array. The function accumulates these counts into a list `results`, which it returns. Additionally, it maintains a dictionary `residue_map` that records the frequency of each unique \((r_x, r_y)\) pair. After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list and the `residue_map` dictionary. The final states of the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` reflect their state just before the last element of the last array is processed.**
