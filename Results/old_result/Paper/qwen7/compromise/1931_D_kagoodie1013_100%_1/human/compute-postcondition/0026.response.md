Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples (since it must have at least one tuple for the current iteration and at least one for the next), `count` is 0**.

The variable `count` is initialized to 0, and the precondition that `test_cases` is a list with at least two tuples remains unchanged.
