Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code `r_y = num % y` assigns the value of `num % y` to the variable `r_y`. The values of `test_cases`, `arr`, and `r_x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
