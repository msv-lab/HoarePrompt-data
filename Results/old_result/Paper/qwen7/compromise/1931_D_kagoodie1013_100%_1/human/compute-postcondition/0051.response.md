Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the first element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, and `arr` is the next test case array.**

Explanation: The line `residue_map = {}` initializes an empty dictionary named `residue_map`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
