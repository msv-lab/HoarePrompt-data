Output State: **`count` is `0 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is `{(current_key): 2}`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array without the first two elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `r_x` to be the value of `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `r_x` is calculated based on the current value of `num` and `x`.
