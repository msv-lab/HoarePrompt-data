Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_y = num % y`, `count` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `count` by adding the value returned by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. Since `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` returns 0. Therefore, `count` remains 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
