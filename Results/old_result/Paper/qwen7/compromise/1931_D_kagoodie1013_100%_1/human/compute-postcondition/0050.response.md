Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`, `residue_map` records how many times each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` appears in `arr`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the first element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, and `arr` is the next test case array.**

Explanation: The line `count = 0` initializes the variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `results`, `residue_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were in the initial state, with `count` being explicitly set to 0.
