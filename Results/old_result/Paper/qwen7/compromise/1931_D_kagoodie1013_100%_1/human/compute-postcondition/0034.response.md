Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `num` from the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
   - `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is incremented by 1.
   - `test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples.
   - `arr` must have at least one element.
   - `r_y` is the result of `num % y`.
   - `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the presence of elements in `arr`, we need to ensure `arr` has at least one element for the next iteration.
   - The values of `count`, `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]`, `r_y`, and `current_key` will change based on the current `num` being processed, but these changes are not relevant for the next iteration's condition check.

Given that the loop will continue if `arr` has at least one element, and assuming the loop body processes one element from `arr` per iteration, `arr` will have one less element after each iteration.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `arr` must have at least one element (one less than the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is incremented by 1, `test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` (these values are not adjusted for the next iteration's condition check)**.

Since the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the number of elements in `arr`, the final answer is:

State: **`arr` must have at least one element**.
