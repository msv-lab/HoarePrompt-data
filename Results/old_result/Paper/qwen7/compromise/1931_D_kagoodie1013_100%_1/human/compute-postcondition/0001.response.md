Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `(n, x, y, arr)` which are unpacked from each tuple in `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: \( n \), \( x \), \( y \), and a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \).
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one tuple in `test_cases`.
   - Each tuple must contain four elements: \( n \), \( x \), \( y \), and a list of \( n \) integers.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `test_cases` is a list, it must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The first tuple in `test_cases` will provide the values for \( n \), \( x \), \( y \), and the list \( arr \).

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `test_cases` must have at least one tuple.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, results is an empty list**
