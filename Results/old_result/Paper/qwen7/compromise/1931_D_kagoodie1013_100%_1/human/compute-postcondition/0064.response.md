Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `num`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `r_y`, and `current_key`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `count` is `0 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`
   - `results` is `[0]`
   - `residue_map` is `{(current_key): 2}`
   - `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array
   - `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple
   - `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple
   - `arr` is the next test case array without the first element
   - `num` is the second element of `arr`
   - `r_y` is `num % y`
   - `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will continue if there are more elements in `arr`.
   - After processing the current `num`, the next `num` will be the third element of `arr` (since the first element was already processed).

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `num` will be the second element of `arr` (which is now the third element of the original `arr`).
- `arr` will be the array without its first two elements.
- `r_y` will be the new `num` modulo `y`.
- `current_key` will be `(num % x, num % y)`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`count` is `0 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is `{(current_key): 2}`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array without the first two elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**
