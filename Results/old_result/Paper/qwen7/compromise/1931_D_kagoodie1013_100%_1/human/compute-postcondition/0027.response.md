Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples (since it must have at least one tuple for the current iteration and at least one for the next), `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `residue_map`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases` or `count`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
