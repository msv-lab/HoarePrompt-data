### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a string \( s \) such that all possible strings of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of \( s \).
   - The string \( s \) should have the smallest possible length, and if there are multiple valid strings, any one of them can be chosen.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` which takes \( n \) and \( k \) as inputs.
   - In `func_1()`, it reads \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - It then creates a string `s` containing the first 20 lowercase English alphabets ('a' to 't').
   - It returns a string consisting of the first \( k \) characters of `s`, repeated \( n \) times.

3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The string `s` is fixed and does not change based on \( n \) and \( k \).
   - For example, if \( k = 3 \), the string `s` is `'abcde...t'`, and the returned string will be `'abcabc...abc'` (repeated \( n \) times).

4. **Subsequence Check**:
   - Consider the test case \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \). The program generates the string `"abcabc...abc"`.
   - This string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets. For instance, it does not contain `"aa"`, `"bb"`, `"cc"`, etc., as valid subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not generate a string that satisfies the required condition. It simply repeats a fixed substring, which does not cover all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly generate a string \( s \) such that all possible strings of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of \( s \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
