numero_testes is an integer such that 1 ≤ numero_testes ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
