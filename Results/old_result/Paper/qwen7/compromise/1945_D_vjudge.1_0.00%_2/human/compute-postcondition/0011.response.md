Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. The loop runs from `n - k` to `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `n - k` and increments by 1 (default increment), the initial value of `i` should be `n - k`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Since the loop starts at `n - k` and goes up to but does not include `n`, the loop will execute if `n - k < n`, which is always true.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `n - k` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`soma_b`, `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`, and `resultado`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is `n - k`**
