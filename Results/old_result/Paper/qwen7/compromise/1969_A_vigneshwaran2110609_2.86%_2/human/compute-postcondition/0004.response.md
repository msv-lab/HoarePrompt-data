Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `x` must be a valid value such that the loop can run. Given that `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and considering that `x` is used as the upper bound for the loop, `x` must be at least 1 and at most 50. However, since `i` starts at 0, `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, `x` must be at least 1.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `x` must be at least 1.
- `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive).

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be at least 1, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive)**.
