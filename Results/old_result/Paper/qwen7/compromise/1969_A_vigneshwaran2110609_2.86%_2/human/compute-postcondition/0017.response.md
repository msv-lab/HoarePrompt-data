Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` must be at least 1, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive). If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition is not met, the values of `i`, `x`, and `n` remain as per the precondition, and `flag` remains unchanged.
