Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `x` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
