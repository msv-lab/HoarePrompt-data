Output State: **`i` is 50, `x` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 50**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `x` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 50 is still valid.
