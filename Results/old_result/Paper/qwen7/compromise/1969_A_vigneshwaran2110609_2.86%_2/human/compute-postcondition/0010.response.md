Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` must be at least 1, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and either the first element of the list `l` at index `i` minus one is equal to the value of `l[i]` minus one (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), or the condition is not met and no changes are made to `i`, `x`, or `n`.
