Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers (`k_i`). However, the problem requires that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The current implementation calculates `m` as the product of all multipliers, which doesn't necessarily satisfy the condition that the sum of bets is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find the highest common factor (HCF) of the list `c`. However, the logic in the main loop where `hcf` is used to reduce the values in `c` is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem's requirements.
   - The HCF calculation is not directly relevant to solving the problem as stated.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Checking and Printing Results:**
   - The logic for checking if the sum of bets is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome is flawed. The current implementation checks if `sum(c) >= m / hcf`, which is incorrect because `m` should be replaced with the minimum value of `k_i`.

### Corrected Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the minimum k_i
    min_k = min(k)
    
    # Calculate the total amount of coins to bet
    total_bets = 1
    for i in range(n):
        total_bets *= k[i]
    
    # Check if it's possible to bet such that the sum of bets is strictly less than the winnings
    if total_bets // min_k <= total_bets - 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        # Distribute the coins such that the sum is just below the minimum winnings
        c = [total_bets // (min_k * k[i]) for i in range(n)]
        if sum(c) >= total_bets // min_k:
            print(-1)
        else:
            for i in range(n):
                print(c[i], end=' ')
            print('')
```

This corrected approach ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
