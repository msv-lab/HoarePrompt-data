Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is an integer value assigned from the input split by spaces.
   - `i` is the loop counter, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments, the loop will execute as long as `i < x`.
   - Therefore, `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `i` should be set to 0 initially.

5. **Consider other relevant variables**:
   - `ans1`: This is the sum of all elements in list `a`. It is not directly related to the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.
   - `n`, `k`, and `a`: These are not part of the loop head, so no adjustments are needed for these either.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**
