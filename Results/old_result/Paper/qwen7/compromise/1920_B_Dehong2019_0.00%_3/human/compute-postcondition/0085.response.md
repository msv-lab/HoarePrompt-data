Output State: **`t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the original sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` which is now equal to `ans1`**.

Explanation: The variable `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `i` is initially 0. So, `ans1` is updated to the original value of `ans1` plus `a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
