Output State: **`t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is either `3` or `4`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, and `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` assigns the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` to `ans`. This does not change the values of `t`, `x`, `i`, or the condition for `ans1`. Therefore, these variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
