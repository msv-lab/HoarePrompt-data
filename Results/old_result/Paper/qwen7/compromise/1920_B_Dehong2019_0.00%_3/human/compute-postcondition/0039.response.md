Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces, and `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `ans1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The list `a` remains sorted in descending order as no changes were made to its elements.
