Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since the input values are not specified, we can only state that they are assigned to these variables as integers. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified but implied to be unchanged.
