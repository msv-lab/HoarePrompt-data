Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[2] * 2 + a[2] * 2`, `x` must be greater than 2**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts `a[i] * 2` from `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]`. So, `ans1` is decreased by `a[2] * 2`. Since `ans1` was already decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[2] * 2` before this line of code, the total decrease in `ans1` is now `a[0] * 2 + a[2] * 2 + a[2] * 2`. The value of `i` remains 2, and the condition that `x` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
