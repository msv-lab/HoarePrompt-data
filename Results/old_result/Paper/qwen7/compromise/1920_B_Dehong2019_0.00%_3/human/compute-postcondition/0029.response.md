Output State: **`ans1` is `ans1` minus `a[i + x]` times 2, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` updates the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from it. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
