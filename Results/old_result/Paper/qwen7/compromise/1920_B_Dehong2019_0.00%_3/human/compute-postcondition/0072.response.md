Output State: **`t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `x + 3`, `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` from the input using the `map` function and the `int` conversion. This changes the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, but does not affect the values of `t`, `x` (which is already defined), `i`, `ans1`, and `ans`. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, along with the unchanged values of `t`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans`.
