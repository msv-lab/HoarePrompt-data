Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * sum(a[:x])` and then increased by `a[0]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`) remain in their initial states.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the first element of the list `a` (denoted as `a[0]`) is added to `ans1`. Since `i` was 0 and now it is incremented by 1, `i` becomes 1. The value of `ans2` remains unchanged and is still equal to `ans1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`) remain in their initial states.
