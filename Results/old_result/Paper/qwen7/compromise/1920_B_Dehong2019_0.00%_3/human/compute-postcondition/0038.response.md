Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input split by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and then sorts the resulting list in descending order. The original values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are unchanged, but a new list `a` is created and populated with the sorted integers.
