You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the value printed during each iteration of the loop based on the input values provided for `x` and `y`. The length of this list will be equal to the value of `ap`, and each element in the list will be calculated according to the conditions specified in the loop body. If `x` and `y` are both positive, the value will be the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`. If `x` is zero and `y` is positive, the value will be `math.ceil(y / 2)`. If `x` is positive and `y` is zero, the value will be `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If both `x` and `y` are non-positive, the value will be `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given conditions: if both \(x\) and \(y\) are positive, it computes the sum of two ceiling values; if only \(y\) is positive, it computes the ceiling of \(y/2\); if only \(x\) is positive, it computes the ceiling of \(x/15\); and if both \(x\) and \(y\) are non-positive, it returns 0. The function outputs a list of these calculated values, one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's consider the following case:

- For `x = 12` and `y = 4`, the expected output is `2`. However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:

  - First, it calculates `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2) = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
  - Then, it calculates `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 = 12 - 2 * 15 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2`, which is incorrect since `x` should remain positive.
  - Finally, it calculates `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) = 0 if -2 <= 0 else math.ceil(-2 / 15) = 0`.

  Therefore, the total number of screens calculated is `bxsfory + bxsfory1 = 2 + 0 = 2`, which seems correct in this specific case. However, let's consider another case to ensure the general correctness.

- For `x = 15` and `y = 0`, the expected output is `1` since all 15 icons of size 1x1 can fit into one screen. However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:

  - It directly prints `math.ceil(x / 15) = math.ceil(15 / 15) = 1`, which is correct.

- For `x = 0` and `y = 9`, the expected output is `5` since 9 icons of size 2x2 require 5 screens. However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:

  - It directly prints `math.ceil(y / 2) = math.ceil(9 / 2) = 5`, which is correct.

However, the program fails to handle the case where `x` and `y` values do not align perfectly with the grid constraints. Specifically, the calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it does not account for the actual placement of 2x2 icons, which occupy 4 cells. This leads to incorrect calculations for certain values of `x` and `y`.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit and then determining how many additional 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space. The current implementation does not accurately reflect this logic.
