### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

#### Function Definition and Input Handling
- The function `func_1()` is defined but not used anywhere in the code. This is indeed a potential issue, but we can ignore this for now and focus on the main logic.
- The main logic starts with `ap = int(input())`, which reads the number of test cases.
- A loop runs `ap` times, processing each test case.

#### Processing Each Test Case
- For each test case, the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`) are read using `map(int, input().split())`.
- Different conditions handle different scenarios:
  - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, a specific calculation is performed.
  - If only `y` is greater than 0, the number of screens needed is calculated directly.
  - If only `x` is greater than 0, the number of screens needed is calculated directly.
  - If both `x` and `y` are 0, 0 screens are needed.

#### Calculation Logic
- The logic for handling the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons needs to be carefully analyzed.

Let's break down the logic for each scenario:

1. **Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid.
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the remaining number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The total number of screens is then `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

2. **Only `y` is greater than 0:**
   - The number of screens needed is simply `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

3. **Only `x` is greater than 0:**
   - The number of screens needed is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

4. **Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
   - 0 screens are needed.

Now, let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
   - `x = 1 - 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 1 - 4 + 4 = 1` (This should be 1 - 1 * 4 = -3, but the logic seems off)
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if 1 <= 0 else math.ceil(1 / 15) = 0`
   - Total screens = `0 + 1 = 1`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
   - `x = 7 - 1 * 15 + 2 * 4 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0`
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if 0 <= 0 else math.ceil(0 / 15) = 0`
   - Total screens = `0 + 1 = 1`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `x = 12`, `y = 4`
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`
   - `x = 12 - 2 * 15 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2`
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if -2 <= 0 else math.ceil(-2 / 15) = 0`
   - Total screens = `0 + 2 = 2`

From these examples, it appears that the logic is flawed, especially in how the remaining 1x1 icons are handled. The current logic incorrectly adjusts the number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed based on the problem description. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
