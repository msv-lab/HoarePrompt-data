The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of length \(n\), where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\). It then checks if \(c\) contains any character that is not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) matches \(a\) or \(b\), or if \(c\) contains only characters from \(a\) and \(b\), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
