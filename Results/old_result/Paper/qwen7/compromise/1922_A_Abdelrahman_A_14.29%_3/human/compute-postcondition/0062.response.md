Output State: **`x` is the last character in `c`, `c` is `c` without its last element, `x` is not in `a`, `x` is not in `b`, `no` is False**

Explanation: The line `no = False` simply reassigns the variable `no` to `False`. None of the other variables (`x`, `c`, `a`, `b`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
