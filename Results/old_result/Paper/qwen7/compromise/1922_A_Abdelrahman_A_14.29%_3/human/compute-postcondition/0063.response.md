Output State: **`x` is the last character in `c`, `c` is `c` without its last element, `x` is not in `a`, `x` is not in `b`, `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `x`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `no` remain unchanged.
