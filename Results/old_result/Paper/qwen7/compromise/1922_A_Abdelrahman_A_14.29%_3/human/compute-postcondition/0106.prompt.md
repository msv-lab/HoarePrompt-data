Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tests` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        for x in c:
            if x not in a and x not in b:
                print('YES')
                no = False
                break
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 0 (if `c` equals `a` or `b`) or the total number of iterations the loop executed (if `c` does not equal `a` or `b`), `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is a string (neither `a` nor `b`), `no` is True, and `x` is the last character in `c` (if the loop breaks due to a character not being in `a` or `b`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `slength` is an updated integer input, `a` is a new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the input from the user, `no` is True, and either `x` is the last character in `c` and at least one character in `c` matches either `a` or `b`, or all characters in `c` have been checked and none of them match both `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `no` is False, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input value, `c` is a non-empty string, and if `c` contains a character that is not in `a` or `b`, the loop breaks, leaving `no`, `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
