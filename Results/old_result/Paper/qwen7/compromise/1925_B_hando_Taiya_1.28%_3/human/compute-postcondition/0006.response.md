Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each `t`, it processes pairs of positive integers `x` and `n` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x). For each pair, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value `t` which indicates the number of subsequent pairs of integers `(x, n)` to process. For each pair `(x, n)`, the function performs an unspecified operation and returns the result accordingly.
