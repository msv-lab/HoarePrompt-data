Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
3. The function `func_1()` is defined to handle the logic for calculating the maximum balance.
4. Inside `func_1()`, the program calculates the maximum balance using the following logic:
   - It iterates through numbers from 1 to the integer square root of `x`.
   - For each number `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
5. After the loop, it prints the value of `ans`.

Given the logic, the program correctly identifies the maximum balance by checking both `i` and `x // i` for the conditions specified. This approach ensures that the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties is maximized.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
