### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties is `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If we can find a divisor `d` of `x` such that `x / d >= n`, then we can have `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `d`. This ensures the sum of difficulties is `x` and the GCD is `d`.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It then iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (`isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` is a valid divisor of `x` and if either `x // i >= n` or `i >= n`.
   - It updates the answer `ans` with the maximum value found.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum balance `ans`.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies potential divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The program ensures that the GCD is maximized by considering both `i` and `x // i` as potential candidates.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, and the solution works within the given limits.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
