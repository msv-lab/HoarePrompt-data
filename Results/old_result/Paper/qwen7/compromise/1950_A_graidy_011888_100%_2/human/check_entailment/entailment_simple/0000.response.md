Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The program checks if the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`) and prints "STAIR" if true.
4. It also checks if the digits form a peak (`a < b and b > c`) and prints "PEAK" if true.
5. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
6. The logic implemented matches the problem description accurately.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the example input/output.

Correctness: **True**
