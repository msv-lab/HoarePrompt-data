State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 (as specified by `range(n)`), so `i` should be set to 0.
- The condition for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.
- The value of `t` (which is between 1 and 1000) does not affect the loop's execution and can remain as given.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `n` to be greater than 0.
