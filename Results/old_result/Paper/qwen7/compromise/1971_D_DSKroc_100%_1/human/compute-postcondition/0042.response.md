Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 1, `count` is 0, `s` is the input string, `flag` is 0, `i` is equal to the length of `s` - 2.**

Explanation: The code sets `flag` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `flag` and retains the initial values of `t`, `q`, `count`, `s`, and `i`.
