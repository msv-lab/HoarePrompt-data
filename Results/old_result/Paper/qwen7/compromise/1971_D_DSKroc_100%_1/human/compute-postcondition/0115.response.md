Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of changes in consecutive characters in the string `s`. If there is no instance where a character is less than its next character, it prints the count plus one; otherwise, it prints the count. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
