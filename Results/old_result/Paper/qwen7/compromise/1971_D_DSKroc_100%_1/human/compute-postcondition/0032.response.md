Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 0, `count` is between 0 and the length of `s` - 1 inclusive, `s` is a non-empty string, `flag` is 0, `i` is equal to the length of `s` - 2, and `count` is incremented each time there is a change in the consecutive characters where the next character is greater than the current one.
