Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 2, `count` is either 1 or 2, `s` is an input string, `flag` is 1, `i` is equal to `len(s) - 1`, `len(s)` must be at least 2. If the digit at position `i` in string `s` is not equal to the digit at position `i + 1`, then `count` is incremented by 1.
