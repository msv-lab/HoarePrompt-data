Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, the new state of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. All other variables (`s`) are not affected by this code snippet.
