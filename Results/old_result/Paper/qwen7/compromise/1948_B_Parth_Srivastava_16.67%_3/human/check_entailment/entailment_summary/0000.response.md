Reasoning:
1. The program aims to process multiple test cases, each with an array of integers.
2. For each integer greater than 10 in the array, the program extracts its digits and reinserts them into a new list `c`.
3. The program then checks if the modified list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. Based on the sorting result, the program appends either 1 (if sorted) or 0 (if not sorted) to the list `b`.
5. However, there are several issues with the implementation:
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly handle the extraction and reinsertion of digits.
   - The logic for appending digits to the list `c` is flawed, especially when dealing with numbers like 10, 20, etc., which should remain as single elements rather than being split.
   - The program does not properly initialize the list `b` before appending values.
   - The program reads all test cases but only processes the first one due to the nested loops and the way the function `func_1()` is called.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted without needing any operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
