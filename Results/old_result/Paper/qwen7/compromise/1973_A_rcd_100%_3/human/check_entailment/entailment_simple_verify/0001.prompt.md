You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: t is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is t, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3. The variable `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` is -1. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` holds true at any point during the loop, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3`. Otherwise, the loop continues until `y` becomes -1, and it prints `p3` at the end.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points Modulo 2:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total score cannot be achieved with the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players).
   - This check is correct.

3. **Handling Special Case Where `p3 >= p1 + p2`:**
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program directly prints `p1 + p2`.
   - This condition is not entirely correct. According to the problem statement, if `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means the maximum possible points for the third player should be `p1 + p2`. However, this does not necessarily mean the scores are consistent. We need to consider the possibility of draws.

4. **Calculating Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating through possible values of `x` and `y` where `x` is the number of points the first player lost due to draws and `y` is the number of points the second player lost due to draws.
   - The loop continues until `y >= x` and checks if the current configuration of `x` and `y` can satisfy the conditions.
   - If a valid configuration is found, it prints `p1 - x + p3`.
   - This part of the logic seems to handle the calculation of draws but has some issues:
     - The logic to find the maximum number of draws is not fully correct. It does not account for all possible configurations of games and draws.
     - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is used to ensure the points distribution is valid, but it does not guarantee the maximum number of draws.

5. **Handling Cases Where No Valid Configuration Found:**
   - If no valid configuration is found within the loop, the program prints `p3`.
   - This is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the scores are inconsistent.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not provide the maximum number of draws in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
