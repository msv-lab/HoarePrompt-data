Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` is 1. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program does not change the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
