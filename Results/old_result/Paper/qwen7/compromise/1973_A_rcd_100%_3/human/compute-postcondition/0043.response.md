Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The conditions about the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even and `p3` being less than or equal to `p1 + p2` remain valid because the input values satisfy these conditions. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
