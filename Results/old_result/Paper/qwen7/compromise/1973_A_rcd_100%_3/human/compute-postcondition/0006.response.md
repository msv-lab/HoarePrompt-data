Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and we continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop or continues to the next part of the conditional statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, and the condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd also remains valid.
