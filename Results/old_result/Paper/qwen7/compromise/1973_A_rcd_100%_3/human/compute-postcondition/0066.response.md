Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `x` is 1, `y` is `p3 - 2` and `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`**

Explanation: The code `y -= 1` decreases the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was initially `p3 - 1`, after executing the code, `y` becomes `p3 - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` still hold true, and `y` must still be greater than or equal to `x`, which is 1.
