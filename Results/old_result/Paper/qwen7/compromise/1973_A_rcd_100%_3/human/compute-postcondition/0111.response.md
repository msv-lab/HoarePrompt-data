Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `p3` is at least 3, and either `x` remains 0 with `y` being 0 (if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`), or `x` is 1 and `y` is 0 (if `p1 - x > p2 - y`), or `y` is -1.
