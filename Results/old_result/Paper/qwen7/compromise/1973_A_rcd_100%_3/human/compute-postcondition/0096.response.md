Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`, `p1 - x > p2 - (p3 - 1)**

Explanation: The code `y -= 1` decreases the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was initially equal to `p3`, now `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
