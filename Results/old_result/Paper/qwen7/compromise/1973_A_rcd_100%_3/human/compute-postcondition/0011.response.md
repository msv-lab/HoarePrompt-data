Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- `_` is 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned from the input split.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
- `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.

The `print(p1 + p2)` statement will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not specified, we can only describe the sum of `p1` and `p2` in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 + p2**
