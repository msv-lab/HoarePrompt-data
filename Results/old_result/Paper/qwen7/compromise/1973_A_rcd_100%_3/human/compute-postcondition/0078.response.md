Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3. The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after all iterations, and in the final state, the following conditions hold:

- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- The variable `_` remains 2.
- The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` still maintain the property that their sum is even and `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
- The value of `p3` is at least 3, as it must have been reduced by at least one unit each iteration until it reaches a point where the condition `y >= x` no longer holds.
- The loop will either break when the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, printing `p1 - x + p3`, or it will continue until `y < x`, at which point it will print `p3` due to the `else` clause.
