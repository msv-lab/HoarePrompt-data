Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3, `x` is 0, the current value of `y` is `p3`, and `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
