Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- `_` is explicitly defined as 3.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that their sum is even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3. They are assigned values from the input split into integers.

However, the specific values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided in the initial state. Despite this, the `print` statement does not depend on these values; it simply prints `-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **-1**
