Output State: **`x` is 0, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `y` is equal to `p3`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `y` has been assigned the value of `p3`, while all other variables retain their initial or previously described states.
