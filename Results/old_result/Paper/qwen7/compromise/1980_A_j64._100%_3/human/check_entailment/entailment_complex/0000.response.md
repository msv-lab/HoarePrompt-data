Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Frequency Counting**: In the function `func_1`, it initializes a list `count` of size 7 (corresponding to the 7 difficulty levels 'A' to 'G') and counts the frequency of each difficulty level in the string `a`.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: For each difficulty level, it checks if the current count is less than `m`. If it is, it calculates how many more problems are needed to reach `m` and adds this to `needed_problems`.

4. **Returning Result**: Finally, it returns the total number of additional problems needed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
