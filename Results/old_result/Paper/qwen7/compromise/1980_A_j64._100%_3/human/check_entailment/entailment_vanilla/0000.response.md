### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `n` and `m` correctly from the input for each test case.
3. **Problem Counting**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using an array `count`.
4. **Calculation of Needed Problems**: For each difficulty level, it calculates how many additional problems are needed to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. This is done by checking if the current count of problems for that difficulty level is less than `m`, and if so, adding the difference to `needed_problems`.
5. **Output**: The function returns the total number of problems needed, which is printed for each test case.

Given the provided code, all steps align with the problem statement and the example provided. Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
