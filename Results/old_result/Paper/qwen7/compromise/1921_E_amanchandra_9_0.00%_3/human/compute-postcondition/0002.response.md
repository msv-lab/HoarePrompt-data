Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', and 'Bob' based on the conditions specified within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if `xa > xb`, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the value of `x` as half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. Depending on whether this difference is odd or even, it then determines the range `[l, r]` and checks if the vertical position `ya` or `yb` falls within certain conditions to decide whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins. If neither condition is met, it prints 'Draw'.
