### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`. If true, it prints "Draw". This condition is incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal strategy of the players.
   - If `xa <= xb`, the program proceeds to calculate the number of moves (`x`) required for Alice to reach the same row as Bob.
   - It then calculates the range of possible moves for Alice and Bob within the board boundaries.
   - The program uses the `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` condition to determine if Alice can force a win, and similarly for Bob.

3. **Optimal Strategy Analysis:**
   - The logic used to determine the outcome is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that Alice can always win if she can move into Bob's row within a certain range, and similarly for Bob.
   - The correct approach involves understanding the parity (odd/even nature) of the distance between Alice and Bob's rows and columns, and how this affects the ability to force a win.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - If the vertical distance (difference in rows) between Alice and Bob is odd, Alice can always force a win by moving to Bob's row.
   - If the vertical distance is even, Bob can always force a draw or win by mirroring Alice's moves.
   - The horizontal distance (difference in columns) also plays a role, but the key is the vertical distance.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
