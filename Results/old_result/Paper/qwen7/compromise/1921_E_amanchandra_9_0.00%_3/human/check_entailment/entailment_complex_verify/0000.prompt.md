You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', and 'Bob' based on the conditions specified within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if `xa > xb`, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the value of `x` as half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. Depending on whether this difference is odd or even, it then determines the range `[l, r]` and checks if the vertical position `ya` or `yb` falls within certain conditions to decide whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins. If neither condition is met, it prints 'Draw'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing six integers representing dimensions and positions. For each test case, it compares two positions (xa, ya) and (xb, yb). If xa is greater than xb, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the horizontal distance between xa and xb and uses this to determine if the vertical position ya or yb falls within a specific range. Depending on whether this distance is odd or even, it decides if 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins, or if the result is 'Draw' again. The function returns a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', and 'Bob' based on these conditions for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the rules of the game. Specifically, the program does not handle the diagonal moves for Alice and the corresponding moves for Bob correctly. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Diagonal Moves for Alice**: Alice can move her chip one cell down, down-right, or down-left. The program only checks the down move (`xa + 1, ya`), but it does not account for the down-right (`xa + 1, ya + 1`) and down-left (`xa + 1, ya - 1`) moves.

2. **Opponent Moves**: Bob can move his chip one cell up, up-right, or up-left. The program does not check these moves correctly. It incorrectly calculates the range for Bob's possible moves and does not properly evaluate whether Bob can block Alice's winning move or vice versa.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
- Alice starts at (2, 2).
- Bob starts at (5, 3).

The program incorrectly determines that since `xa > xb`, the result is a draw. However, Alice can move to (3, 3) and then to (4, 4), which would put her in the same row as Bob, potentially leading to a win. The program fails to account for this scenario.

Another example:
```
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
- Alice starts at (2, 1).
- Bob starts at (4, 1).

The program incorrectly concludes a draw because `xa > xb`. However, Alice can move to (3, 1) and then to (4, 1), capturing Bob's chip. The program does not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game rules for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
