### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each excursion if they are chosen.
- The probability of choosing each pair is not uniform; it depends on the number of friends each child has.

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
       result = 0
       for i in range(m):
           (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
           result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
       return result % MOD
   ```
   - This function iterates over all \( m \) pairs of friends.
   - For each pair, it adds the product of the friendship value \( f \) and the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers (which is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \)) to the result.
   - This calculation does not account for the actual probabilities of choosing each pair.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   ```python
   def func_2():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
           friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
           result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
           print(result)
   ```
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the inputs for each test case and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` does not account for the actual probabilities of choosing each pair. The formula used in `func_1` assumes that each pair is chosen with equal probability, which is incorrect.
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of choosing each pair based on the number of friends each child has.
- The expected value for each pair should be calculated as the product of the friendship value and the probability of choosing that pair in each excursion.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution because it does not account for the actual probabilities of choosing each pair.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not account for the actual probabilities of choosing each pair of friends, leading to incorrect results.
