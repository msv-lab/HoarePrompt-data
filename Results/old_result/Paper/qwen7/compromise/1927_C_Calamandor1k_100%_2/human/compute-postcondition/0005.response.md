Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, with specific constraints. The function returns a list of strings ('YES' or 'NO') for each test case based on certain conditions involving sets derived from lists `a` and `b`. If the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds `k // 2`, or the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than `k`, then 'NO' is added to the results list. Otherwise, 'YES' is added.**
