Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case, correctly parsing the values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), as well as the arrays \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It creates sets of unique elements from arrays \(a\) and \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(k\).
   - It identifies elements that are unique to \(a\) and \(b\) and those that are common to both.
   - It checks if the number of unique elements in either \(a\) or \(b\) exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it immediately returns 'NO' because it would be impossible to select \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from one of the arrays without exceeding the limit.
   - It calculates the total number of distinct elements available across both arrays. If this total is less than \(k\), it also returns 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it concludes that it is possible to choose the required elements and returns 'YES'.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case as specified.

Given the logic and implementation, the program accurately determines whether it is possible to meet the criteria for each test case, making the correctness assessment **True**.
