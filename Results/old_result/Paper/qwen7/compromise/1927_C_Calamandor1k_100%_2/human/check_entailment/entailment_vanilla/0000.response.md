Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, array `a`, and array `b`.
3. For each test case, it creates sets of unique elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
4. It then calculates the number of elements that are exclusive to `a` (`only_a`), exclusive to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
5. The program checks if the number of elements exclusive to `a` or `b` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it immediately appends 'NO' to the results and moves to the next test case.
6. It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is at least `k`. If not, it appends 'NO' to the results.
7. If neither of the above conditions fail, it appends 'YES' to the results.
8. The logic in the program correctly follows the problem statement and ensures that all numbers from 1 to `k` can be included among the chosen elements from both arrays.
9. The function `func_1` processes each test case and returns the results in a list.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
