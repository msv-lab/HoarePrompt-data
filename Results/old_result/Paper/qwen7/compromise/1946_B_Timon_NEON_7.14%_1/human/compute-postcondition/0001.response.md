The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `number`, which is an integer representing the sum of the original array, and `quantity`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations k. The function does not specify a particular operation to perform on the sum based on the number of operations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept an integer `number` representing the sum of an array and a non-negative integer `quantity` representing the number of operations, and return a value based on these inputs without further details on the operations.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` representing the sum of an array and a non-negative integer `quantity` representing the number of operations, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
