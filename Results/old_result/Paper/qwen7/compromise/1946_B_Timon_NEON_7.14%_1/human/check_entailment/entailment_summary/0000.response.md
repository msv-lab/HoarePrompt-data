Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The operations can be performed in any order.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Inserting the sum of a subarray can potentially increase the overall sum of the array.
   - The optimal strategy is to insert the sum of the largest possible subarray multiple times, especially if the subarray has a positive sum.
   - If the subarray has a negative sum, it might not be beneficial to include it in the operations.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_2**: This function finds the longest contiguous subarray with a non-negative sum and returns its sum and ending index. This helps in identifying the most beneficial subarray to insert multiple times.
   - **func_1**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the given code, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of the solution.

4. **Code Logic**:
   - The main logic is in the loop where the function processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` to get the maximum segment sum and its ending index.
   - If the maximum segment sum is negative, it sets it to 0 to avoid reducing the total sum.
   - It then calculates the final sum using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `func_1`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the maximum segment sum and handles the case where the segment sum is negative.
   - The formula used to calculate the final sum is correct and accounts for the effect of inserting the segment sum multiple times.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
