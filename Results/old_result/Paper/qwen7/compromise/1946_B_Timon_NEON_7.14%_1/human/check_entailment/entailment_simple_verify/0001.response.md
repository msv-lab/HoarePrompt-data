### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is used correctly in the solution to ensure the final result fits within the required constraints.
   - **Correct**: This function is implemented correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray of non-negative elements.
   - The logic inside the loop is supposed to identify the maximum sum subarray with non-negative elements and store it in `max_segment`.
   - However, the implementation has several issues:
     - The logic for managing `new_segment` and `max_segment` is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the merging of segments.
     - The logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is also incorrect. It should only append segments that have a sum greater than or equal to `max_sum`.
     - The final check to set `total_max_segment` to `-1` if the length is 1 is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - **Incorrect**: The function `func_2` is not correctly identifying the maximum sum subarray.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is not implemented at all. It is declared but left empty.
   - **Incorrect**: This function is not implemented, which means it cannot be used in the solution.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray with non-negative elements.
  - The logic for handling segments is incorrect. For example, consider the array `[2, -3, 4, -5, 6]`. The function should identify the subarray `[4, -5, 6]` as the maximum sum subarray, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.
  - The logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is also incorrect. It should only append segments that have a sum greater than or equal to `max_sum`.

- **Function `func_3`**:
  - This function is completely empty and not used in the solution.
  - Since it is not implemented, it cannot contribute to the solution.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the maximum sum subarray with non-negative elements.
2. Calculate the sum of the original array.
3. Compute the maximum possible sum after k operations by doubling the maximum sum subarray and adding the sum of the original array minus the maximum sum subarray.

Here is a corrected approach:

```python
from math import *

def func_1(number):
    return number % 1000000007

def func_2(arr):
    max_sum = 0
    current_sum = 0
    start = 0
    end = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        current_sum += arr[i]
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
            start = i + 1
        elif current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            end = i
    return max_sum

def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max_segment = func_2(a)
        if max_segment == 0:
            max_segment = sum(a)
        answer = (max_segment * (2 ** k) + sum(a) - max_segment) % 1000000007
        print(func_1(answer))

solve()
```

### Final Evaluation:

- **Function `func_1`**: Correct.
- **Function `func_2`**: Incorrect due to flawed logic.
- **Function `func_3`**: Not implemented.

Since the core logic for finding the maximum sum subarray is incorrect, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
