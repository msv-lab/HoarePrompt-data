Output State: **`cases` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ cases ≤ 100, `n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `i` is 1, `arr` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The values of `cases`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about `arr` being an empty list while keeping the original constraints and values of `cases`, `n`, and `i`.
