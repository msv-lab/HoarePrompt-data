Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 2.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cases` is 3
   - `arr` is either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]` or `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`
   - `j` is 1 or 2
   - `lex` is an input integer reduced by either 1 or 26 depending on whether `lex` is less than or equal to 26.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to 1 (inclusive), at the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have been 1 (because if it were 2, the loop would have continued).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The values of `cases`, `arr`, and `lex` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]` or `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`, `j` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer reduced by either 1 or 26 depending on whether `lex` is less than or equal to 26.**
