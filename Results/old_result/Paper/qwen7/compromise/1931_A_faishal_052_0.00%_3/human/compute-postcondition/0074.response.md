Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]`, `j` is 1 or 2, and `lex` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was either `[1]` or `[26]`, after appending `1`, `arr` becomes either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]`. The values of `cases`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged.
