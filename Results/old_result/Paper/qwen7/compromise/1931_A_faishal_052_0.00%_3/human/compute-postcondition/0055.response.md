State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, `lex` is an input integer** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `j` is defined in the range function `range(2)`, which means `j` can take values from 0 to 1 (inclusive).
- The initial state of `cases` is 3, which does not affect the execution of the loop.
- The initial state of `arr` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution either.
- The value of `lex` as an input integer is irrelevant to the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `j` must be within the range of 0 to 1 inclusive.
