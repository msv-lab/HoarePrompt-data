Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 53, and `arr` contains the elements [1]**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so it is now `lex - 1`. Since `lex` was originally a value less than or equal to 52, after decrementing by 1, it is now a value less than or equal to 53. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
