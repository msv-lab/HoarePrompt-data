Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 1, 26]` or `[26, 1, 26]` or `[1, 26, 26]` or `[26, 26, 26]`, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer reduced by 26.**

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 26` subtracts 26 from the current value of `lex`. Since the initial state specifies that `lex` is an input integer reduced by either 1 or 26 depending on whether `lex` is less than or equal to 26, after executing the code, `lex` will be further reduced by 26. The other variables (`cases`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
