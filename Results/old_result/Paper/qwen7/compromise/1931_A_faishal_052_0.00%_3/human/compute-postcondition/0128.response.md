Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the elements 1 and 26.**

Explanation: The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the element 26. After appending 26, `arr` now contains the elements 1 and 26. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
