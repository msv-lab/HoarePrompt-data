Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', 'c' in sequence without spaces. This means the loop has completed its iterations for `cases = 3`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(cases)`. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` would have gone through all values from 0 to `cases-1`.

3. **Adjusting States**: The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cases`. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` would have reached the value `cases - 1` (which is 2 in this case, since `cases = 3`).

4. **Final State**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `cases - 1`, and the condition `i < cases` will no longer be true, meaning the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case is the end of the loop) should reflect the final value of `i` and the fact that the loop has completed all its iterations.

**State: **`i` is 2, `cases` is 3**
