Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` in the range `range(2)`. This means `j` can take values from 0 to 1.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is currently 0.
   - `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26.
   - `arr` contains the element 26.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` remains [1].

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to 1, the next value `j` can take is 1.
   - The condition `lex <= 26` still holds because no operation inside the loop changes the value of `lex`.
   - The condition `arr` containing the element 26 also remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume it does not change.
   - The condition `arr` remaining [1] if `lex` is less than or equal to 25 still holds as no operation inside the loop changes this condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26, and `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` remains [1].**
