Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is a value less than or equal to 53; `arr` contains the elements [1, 26]**.

The code `arr.append(26)` adds the element `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained the element `[1]`. After appending `26`, `arr` now contains `[1, 26]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
