Postcondition: `j` is 0, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 52, and `arr` contains the element corresponding to the value of `lex`. Specifically, if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the element 1; if `lex` is equal to 26 or a value between 26 and 52, `arr` contains the element 26.
