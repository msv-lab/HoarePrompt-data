Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement: `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `chr` function returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer passed to it.
   - The expression inside `chr` is `arr[k] + 96`.
   - Since `k` is 1, we need to know the value of `arr[1]` to proceed further.
   - However, the value of `arr` is not provided in the initial state. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact character that will be printed.

Given the lack of information about the value of `arr[1]`, we can only describe the process and the format of the output.

Output: **the character corresponding to arr[1] + 96 (where arr[1] is the second element of the list arr)**
