Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and the range object. The variable `j` is the iterator of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` set to 0 because `range(2)` generates values from 0 to 1.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. Since `j` starts at 0, it will execute once when `j` is 0 and again when `j` is 1.

4. **List the variables that need adjustment**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

5. **State the required adjustments**: Given that `j` starts at 0, after the first iteration, `j` will be 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is initially 0 and will increment to 1 during the loop execution.

6. **Consider other variables**: The variables `cases`, `n`, `i`, and `arr` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 0**
