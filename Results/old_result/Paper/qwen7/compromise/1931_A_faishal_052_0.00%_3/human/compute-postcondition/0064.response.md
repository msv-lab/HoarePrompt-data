Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is [26], `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, `lex` is an input integer equal to `lex - 26`.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is updated by subtracting 26 from its original value, which was an integer greater than 26 and less than 52. After the operation, `lex` now holds the value of its original value minus 26. The other variables (`cases`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
