Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 52, and `arr` contains the elements [1, 26]**.

Explanation: The initial state of `j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 52, and `arr` contains the element corresponding to the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the element 1; if `lex` is equal to 26 or a value between 26 and 52, `arr` contains the element 26. After executing `arr.append(26)`, the list `arr` will contain both elements 1 and 26.
