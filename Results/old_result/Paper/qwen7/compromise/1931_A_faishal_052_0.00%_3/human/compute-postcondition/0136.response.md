Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `j`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 2.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 1.
   - `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26.
   - `arr` contains the elements 1 and 26.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the first iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The values of `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is 2.
- `lex` remains a value less than or equal to 26.
- `arr` still contains the elements 1 and 26.

State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26, and `arr` contains the elements 1 and 26**.
