Output State: **j is 2, lex is a value less than or equal to 27, and arr contains the elements [1, 1, lex]**.

Explanation: The `arr.sort()` command sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the initial state where `arr` contains the elements `[1, 1, lex]`, the sorting will not change the first two elements (both are 1) since they are already in the smallest possible order. The element `lex` will remain in its original position unless it equals 1, in which case its position would not change either. Since `lex` is less than or equal to 27, the sorted array remains `[1, 1, lex]`. The values of `j` and `lex` are unchanged.
