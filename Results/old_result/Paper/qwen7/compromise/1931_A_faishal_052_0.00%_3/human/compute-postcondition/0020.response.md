Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 52, and `arr` contains the elements [1].**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained an element corresponding to the value of `lex`. Since `lex` is less than or equal to 52, `arr` originally had one element (either 1 or 26). After appending `1` to `arr`, the list now contains `[1]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
