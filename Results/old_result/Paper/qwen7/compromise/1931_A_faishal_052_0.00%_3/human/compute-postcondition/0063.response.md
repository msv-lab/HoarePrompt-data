Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is [26], `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, `lex` is an input integer greater than 26 and less than 52.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` is an empty list, so after appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26]`. The values of `cases`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
