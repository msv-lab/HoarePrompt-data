Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is [26], `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 52**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` was an empty list. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26]`. The other variables (`cases`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
