Postcondition: `cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, `[26, 26, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`, and `j` is 2. If `lex` is reduced by 1, then `lex` is an input integer reduced by 1. Otherwise, `lex` is an input integer reduced by 26.
