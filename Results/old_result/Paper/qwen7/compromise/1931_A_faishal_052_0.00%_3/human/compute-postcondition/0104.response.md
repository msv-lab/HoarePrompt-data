Given the initial state where `k` is 2, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')` statement.

Let's break it down:

1. The value of `k` is explicitly given as 2.
2. The statement accesses `arr[k]`, which means `arr[2]`.
3. We need to know the value of `arr[2]` to proceed. Since this value is not provided in the initial state, let's denote it as `arr[2] = x`.

Therefore, the expression inside the `chr()` function becomes `x + 96`.

4. The `chr()` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character. Adding 96 to `x` shifts the ASCII value to a range that typically corresponds to lowercase letters (since 'a' in ASCII is 97).

Without the explicit value of `arr[2]`, we can only describe the output in terms of `x`:

Output: **chr(x + 96)**
