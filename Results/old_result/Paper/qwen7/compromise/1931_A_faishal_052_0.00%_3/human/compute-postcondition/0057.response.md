Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is [1], `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, `lex` is an input integer, and the current value of `lex` is less than or equal to 26**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is an empty list. After executing the code, `arr` becomes `[1]`. All other variables (`cases`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
