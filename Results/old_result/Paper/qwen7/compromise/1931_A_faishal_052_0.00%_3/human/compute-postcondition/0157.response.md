Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence.

Explanation: Given the loop iterates 3 times (as per the range(3)), and each iteration prints the character corresponding to the current value of `arr[k] + 96`, where `arr` is sorted as [1, 26, lex]. Since `lex` is less than or equal to 26, the sorted array will be [1, 26, lex], making the characters printed 'a', 'b', and 'c'. After all iterations, the loop finishes, and the output is 'abc'.
