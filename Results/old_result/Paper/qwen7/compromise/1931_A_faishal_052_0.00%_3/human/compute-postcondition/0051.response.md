Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'aabbcc'.

Explanation: The loop runs three times as specified by `range(3)`. Each iteration prints a character based on the value in `arr` converted from a number to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`. Given the initial state where `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, the first two elements are `1`, which correspond to 'a' when converted (since `chr(1+96)` is `'a'`). The third element is `lex`, which is a value less than or equal to 27, so it will convert to a character between 'a' and 'z'. After three iterations, the loop prints 'aabbcc', assuming `lex` is `3` (resulting in 'c').
