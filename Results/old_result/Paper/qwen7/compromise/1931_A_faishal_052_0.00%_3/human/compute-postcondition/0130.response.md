Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the elements 1 and 26**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the element 26 and if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` remains [1]. After appending 26, `arr` becomes [1, 26]. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
