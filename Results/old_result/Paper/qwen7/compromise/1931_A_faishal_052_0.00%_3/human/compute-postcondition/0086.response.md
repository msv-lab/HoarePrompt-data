Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 1, 1]` or `[26, 1, 1]` or `[1, 26, 1]` or `[26, 26, 1]`, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer reduced by 1.**

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `lex`. Since `lex` was previously an input integer reduced by either 1 or 26 depending on whether `lex` is less than or equal to 26, now `lex` is further reduced by 1. All other variables (`cases`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
