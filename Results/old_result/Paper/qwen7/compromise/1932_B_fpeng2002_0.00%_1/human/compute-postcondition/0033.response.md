Output State: **`x` is equal to the length of `nums` minus one; `start_year` is 0; `num_tests` is `num_tests` - 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `start_year = 0` sets the value of `start_year` to 0. This changes the value of `start_year` from its previous complex expression to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
