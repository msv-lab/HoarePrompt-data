Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `x` is 0
- `start_year` is calculated as `(((start_year + 1) // nums[0]) + 1) * nums[0]`

### Loop Head
- The loop iterates over `x` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.

### End of Previous Iteration
- `x` is 0
- `start_year` is calculated based on the initial value of `start_year` and `nums[0]`

### Adjusting States for Next Iteration
- Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be 1.
- The calculation for `start_year` does not depend on `x`, but rather on the initial value of `start_year` and `nums[0]`. Therefore, `start_year` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### New State
- `x` is 1 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1)
- `start_year` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration

### Final Answer
State: **`x` is 1, `start_year` is (((`start_year` + 1) // `nums[0]`) + 1) * `nums[0`]**

Note that the exact value of `start_year` is not provided, but its formula remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
