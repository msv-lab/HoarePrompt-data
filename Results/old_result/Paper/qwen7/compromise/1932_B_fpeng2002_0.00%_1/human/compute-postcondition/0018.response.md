Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that are input separated by spaces, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]**.

Explanation: The code takes an input string containing multiple integers separated by spaces and converts it into a list of integers using a list comprehension. This list replaces the original `nums` list. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `start_year`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
