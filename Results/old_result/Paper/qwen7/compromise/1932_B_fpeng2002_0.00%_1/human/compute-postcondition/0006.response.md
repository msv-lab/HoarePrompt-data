Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. In this case, the loop iterates over the `nums` list using the variable `x`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `nums` list. The loop will iterate from `x = 0` to `x = len(nums) - 1`.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the `nums` list has at least one element for the loop to execute. Additionally, we need to set the initial value of `x` to 0.

Given these points, let's formulate the required state adjustments:

- **`nums` must have at least one element**: This ensures that the loop can start and iterate at least once.
- **`x` must be 0**: This sets the initial value of the loop variable `x`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is 0, `x` is 0**
