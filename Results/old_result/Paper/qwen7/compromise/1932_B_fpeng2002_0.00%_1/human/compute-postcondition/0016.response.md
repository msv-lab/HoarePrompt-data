Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests -= 1` decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `start_year`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
