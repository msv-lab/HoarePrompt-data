Output State: `num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the list `nums` minus one (`len(nums) - 1`). The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` will be applied to the last element of the list `nums`. Therefore, the final value of `start_year` will be determined by the last iteration of the loop, using the last element of the `nums` list.
