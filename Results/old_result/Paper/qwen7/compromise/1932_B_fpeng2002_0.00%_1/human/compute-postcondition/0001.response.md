Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
2. We need to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
3. The state right before the loop is given as `num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

Since `num_tests` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), it already satisfies the condition `num_tests > 0`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**
