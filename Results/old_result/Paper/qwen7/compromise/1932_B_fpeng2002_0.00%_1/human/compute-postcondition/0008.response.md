Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `x` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `start_year` is calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, where `x` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be 1.
   - The length of the list `nums` remains the same throughout the loop, so `len(nums)` does not change.

4. **Update the `start_year` calculation**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was 0, so `start_year` was calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be 1, so `start_year` will be updated based on `nums[1]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `num_tests` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `nums` remains unchanged.
   - `start_year` will be recalculated using `nums[1]` for the next iteration.
   - `x` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 1**.
