Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that are input separated by spaces, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1], `start_year` is 0**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `start_year`. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial state. The expression for `start_year` is evaluated using the initial value of `start_year`, which is `0`. Since `0 + 1` is `1`, and `1 // nums[len(nums)-1]` (assuming `nums` is non-empty) would be `0` if `nums[len(nums)-1]` is greater than `1`, the expression simplifies to `((0 + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`, which is `nums[len(nums)-1]`. However, since `start_year` is reassigned to `0`, the final value of `start_year` is `0`.
