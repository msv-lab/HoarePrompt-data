Output State: **`x` is 0, `start_year` is (((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]), `num_tests` is `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` by performing the same operation as its initial definition. Specifically, `start_year` is reassigned to `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
