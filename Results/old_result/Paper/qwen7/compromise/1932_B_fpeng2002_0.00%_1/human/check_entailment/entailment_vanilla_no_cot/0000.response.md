Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly compute the year when all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in the loop where `start_year` is updated is flawed. Specifically, the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

To fix this, we need to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence of numbers to determine the year when all signs will occur. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        # Compute LCM of all numbers in the list
        result = reduce(lcm, nums)
        print(result)

func()
```

This version uses the `lcm` function to compute the least common multiple of all the periodicities, which gives the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
