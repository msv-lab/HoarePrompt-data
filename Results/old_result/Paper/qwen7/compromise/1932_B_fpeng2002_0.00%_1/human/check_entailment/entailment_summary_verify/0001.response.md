### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when all `n` signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially.
   - Each sign occurs every `a_i` years, and the next sign only appears after the current one has occurred.
   - We need to compute the cumulative time for all signs to align.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`nums`).
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - It iterates over the list of periodicities and updates `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic used in the loop is incorrect. Specifically, the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly compute the next year when the next sign will occur.
   - Instead, the correct approach would be to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to find the next year when all signs will occur together.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the year when all signs will occur, we need to compute the LCM of all periodicities.
   - The LCM can be computed iteratively using the formula `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - The given code attempts to update `start_year` in a way that does not reflect the correct cumulative effect of the periodicities.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that the function calculates a value `start_year` based on the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided implementation does not correctly achieve this goal.
   - The function should compute the LCM of the periodicities to determine the year when all signs will occur.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code does not correctly implement the logic to find the year when all signs will occur. It uses an incorrect formula and does not account for the sequential nature of the signs.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the year when all signs will occur.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
