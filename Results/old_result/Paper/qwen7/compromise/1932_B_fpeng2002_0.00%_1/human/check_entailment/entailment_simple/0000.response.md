Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`nums`).
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0.
4. It then iterates over the list `nums` in reverse order (from the last element to the first), updating `start_year` to ensure it is a multiple of each `a_i` after considering the previous sign's occurrence.
5. This approach ensures that `start_year` is the smallest year in which all signs will occur sequentially.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `start_year`.

Given this analysis, the logic in the program is sound and should produce the correct result for each test case as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
