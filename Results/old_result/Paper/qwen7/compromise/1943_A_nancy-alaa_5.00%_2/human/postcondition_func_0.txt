The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest missing integer or the smallest integer with a count of 1 after the first unique element. If no such element is found, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
