Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
