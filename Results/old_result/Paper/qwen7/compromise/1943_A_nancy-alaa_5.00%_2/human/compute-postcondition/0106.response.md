Output State: **Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and the current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of the variables `first`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp` remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.
