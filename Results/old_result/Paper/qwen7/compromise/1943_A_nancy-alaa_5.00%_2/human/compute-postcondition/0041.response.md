Postcondition: `first` is True, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, then the values of `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
