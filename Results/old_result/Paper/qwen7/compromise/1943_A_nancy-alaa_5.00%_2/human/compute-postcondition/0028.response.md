Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `first` and `i`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `first` and `i` remain the same, and the program exits the loop or if statement it was in.
