Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and the current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1.**

Explanation: The variable `first` is set to `True`. All other conditions remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, `i` is still less than `n`, `arr` is still a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is still a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and the current value of `i` is still a key in `mpp` with a count of 1.
