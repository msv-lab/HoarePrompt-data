Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1.**

The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `first`. Since the initial state of `first` was already `True`, the value of `first` remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `n` also remain unchanged as they were part of the postcondition and not affected by the code.
