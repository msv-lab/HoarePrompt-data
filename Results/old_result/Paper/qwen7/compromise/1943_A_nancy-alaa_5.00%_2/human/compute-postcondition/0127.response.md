Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains `False`, which means it hasn't been set to `True` yet.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since no specific value for `i` is given initially, we need to consider the context. Typically, `i` would be an integer, and the expression `i + 1` suggests that `i` is being incremented by 1. However, without an explicit initial value for `i`, we can only say that `i` is being incremented by 1 from whatever its current value is.
- `arr` is a list of integers, but no specific values are provided.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the count of each element in `arr`.

Given this information, the `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we can only say that `i` is being incremented by 1 from its current value.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the current value of i before it is incremented)**
