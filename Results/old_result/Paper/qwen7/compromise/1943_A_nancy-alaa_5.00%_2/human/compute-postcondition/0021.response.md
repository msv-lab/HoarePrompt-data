Postcondition: `first` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and if the current value of `i` is such that `mpp[i]` equals 1, `first` will be set to True. If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1, the value of `first` remains unchanged.
