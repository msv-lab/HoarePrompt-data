Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is `i - 1`, `n` is the same as before, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that `i` is part of. The values of `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the program exits the loop or conditional block.
