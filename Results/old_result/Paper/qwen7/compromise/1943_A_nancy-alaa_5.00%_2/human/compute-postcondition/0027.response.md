Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `True`
- `i` is `1`
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is explicitly stated to be `1` and there is no indication that `i` changes within the scope of the print statement, we can conclude that `i` remains `1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is `1`.

Output: **1**
