Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, `n` is the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The line `first = False` changes the value of the variable `first` from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
