Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is n-2, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is updated to a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `arr`. The other variables (`first`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.
