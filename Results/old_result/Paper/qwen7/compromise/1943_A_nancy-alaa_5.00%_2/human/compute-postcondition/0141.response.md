Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. For each test case, it processes the data and returns information based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific constraints on the values of t, n, and the array a. The function processes these inputs and returns outputs based on the provided conditions, though the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.
