Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `first` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `first` remains False, `i` is decremented to `n-3`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and `n` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `first` remains False, `i` is n-1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
