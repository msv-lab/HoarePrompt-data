Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no changes occur to `first`, `i`, `arr`, or `mpp`.
