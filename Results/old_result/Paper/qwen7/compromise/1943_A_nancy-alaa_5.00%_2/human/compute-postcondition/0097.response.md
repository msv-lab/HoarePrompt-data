Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially `n-2`, we need to ensure that `i < n` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`first` remains False, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and `n` is an input integer**
