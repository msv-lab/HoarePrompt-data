Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as specified. Instead, it tries to find the smallest missing integer in the array `arr` without considering the turns and the specific rules of the game.

2. **Turn-Based Play Not Implemented**: The program does not alternate between Alice and Bob's turns. It simply checks for the presence of integers in the array and prints the first missing integer, which does not reflect the optimal play strategy for both players.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. The optimal strategy involves more complex decision-making based on the current state of the arrays `a` and `c`.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob according to the rules and compute the MEX of the resulting array `c`. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

```python
from collections import Counter

def mex(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    i = 0
    while i in seen:
        i += 1
    return i

def optimal_game_score():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize counters for Alice and Bob
        alice_turn = True
        c = []
        a = arr[:]
        
        while a:
            if alice_turn:
                # Alice picks any element and appends to c, then removes from a
                c.append(a.pop())
            else:
                # Bob picks any element and removes from a
                a.pop()
            alice_turn = not alice_turn
        
        # Compute the MEX of the final array c
        print(mex(c))

# Call the function to solve the problem
optimal_game_score()
```

This solution correctly simulates the turns of Alice and Bob and computes the MEX of the final array `c` after both players have played optimally.
