Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice). It then returns information based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a count of test cases (`t`), a count of integers (`n`), and a list of integers. The function processes these inputs and returns specific information according to the given constraints.
