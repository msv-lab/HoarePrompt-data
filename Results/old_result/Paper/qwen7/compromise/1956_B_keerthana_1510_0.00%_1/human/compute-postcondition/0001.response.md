Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and for each test case, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is given where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list. After executing the loop, the value of each a_i remains unchanged, but the output is the sum of counts of each unique element in the list divided by 3, printed for each test case.
