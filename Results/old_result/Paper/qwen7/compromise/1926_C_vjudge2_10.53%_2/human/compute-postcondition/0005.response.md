Output State: **`numbers` is a list of `t` integers where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`; `values` is a list of `max(numbers) + 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `values` with `max(numbers) + 1` elements, all set to 0. Each element in `values` corresponds to an index starting from 0 up to `max(numbers)`. Since the exact values in `numbers` are not specified, we only know the length of `values` is `max(numbers) + 1` and all its elements are initialized to 0. The `numbers` list remains unchanged from the initial state.
