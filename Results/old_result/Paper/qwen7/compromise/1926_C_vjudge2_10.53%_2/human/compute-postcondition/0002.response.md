Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute at least once if `t` is within this range.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `t` and `_`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable, it doesn't affect the loop's execution. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

Given that `t` is an input integer and the loop will execute as long as `t > 0`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

**State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
