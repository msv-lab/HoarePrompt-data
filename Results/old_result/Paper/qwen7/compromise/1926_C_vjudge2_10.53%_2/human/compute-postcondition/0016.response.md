Output State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is a list of `t` integers (unchanged), `values` is a list of 11 integers `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 45]`, `sum_values` is a list of 11 integers `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 90]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list. However, since the loop body does not modify any of the given variables (`total`, `numbers`, `values`, or `sum_values`), these variables remain unchanged. The loop simply prints the `sum_values` at the index of each element in `numbers`. Given the initial conditions, the lists `values` and `sum_values` are extended to include the new calculated values for indices 10 to 10 (since only one iteration is expected if `numbers` contains only one element). Therefore, the final values in both lists remain as specified in the initial state.
