Output State: **`numbers` is a list of `t` integers where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`; `values` is a list of `max(numbers) + 1` zeros; `sum_values` is a list of `max(numbers) + 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum_values` as a list of `(max(numbers) + 1)` zeros. The length of `sum_values` is determined by the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one. The initial values of `numbers` and `values` remain unchanged.
