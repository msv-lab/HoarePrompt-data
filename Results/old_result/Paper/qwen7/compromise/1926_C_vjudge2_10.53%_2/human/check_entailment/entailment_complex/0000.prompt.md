Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.

    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` integers are read from the input and appended to the `numbers` list, resulting in a list of `t` integers where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is a list of `t` integers (unchanged), `values` is a list of 10 integers `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `sum_values` is a list of 10 integers `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is a list of `t` integers (unchanged), `values` is a list of 10 integers `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 45]`, `sum_values` is a list of 11 integers `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 90]`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from 10 to `n` (assuming `n` is at least 10 for the loop to run). For each iteration, it calculates `values[i]` based on the last digit and the remaining part of the number, then updates `sum_values[i]` by adding `values[i]` to the previous sum up to `i-1`. Given the initial conditions, the loop will extend the lists `values` and `sum_values` to include the new calculated values for indices 10 to `n`. Since no specific `n` was provided beyond 10, we assume the loop runs until `n` is just above 10, thus extending the lists to index 10. The final value in `values` is 45, and the final value in `sum_values` is the sum of all previous values plus 45, which is 90.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is a list of `t` integers (unchanged), `values` is a list of 11 integers `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 45]`, `sum_values` is a list of 11 integers `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 90]`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list. However, since the loop body does not modify any of the given variables (`total`, `numbers`, `values`, or `sum_values`), these variables remain unchanged. The loop simply prints the `sum_values` at the index of each element in `numbers`. Given the initial conditions, the lists `values` and `sum_values` are extended to include the new calculated values for indices 10 to 10 (since only one iteration is expected if `numbers` contains only one element). Therefore, the final values in both lists remain as specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and `t` integers `n` from the input, then processes these integers to update two lists, `values` and `sum_values`. After processing, it prints the value of `sum_values` at the index of each integer in the `numbers` list. The function does not return any value but modifies the `values` and `sum_values` lists based on the input integers.
