Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is a new input integer, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `inp` is updated with new integer values from input.**

The code initializes `ans` to 0. This does not change the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, or `inp`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were in the initial state, with `ans` being explicitly set to 0.
