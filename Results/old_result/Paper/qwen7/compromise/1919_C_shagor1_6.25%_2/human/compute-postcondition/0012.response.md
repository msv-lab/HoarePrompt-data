Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is now equal to `a`, `ans` is 0, `inp` must have at least one element, and `a > x`.**

Explanation: The code `y = a` updates the value of `y` to be equal to the current value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
