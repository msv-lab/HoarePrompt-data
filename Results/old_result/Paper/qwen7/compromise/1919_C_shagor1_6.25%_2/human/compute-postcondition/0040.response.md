Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `inp` is the same list as before, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is equal to either the next element in `inp` (let's call it `a_new`) or `a` depending on the condition `a <= x`, `y` is equal to `a` if `a <= x` or `a_new` if `a > x`, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `x <= y` holds true, and `y` is now equal to `a` if `a <= y` or `a_new` if `a > y`. If `a <= x`, `y` is set to `a` if `a <= y` or `a_new` if `a > y`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a > x`, `y` is set to `a_new` and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a_new > x`.
