Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `inp` is the same list as before, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is either `n + 1` or `a` if `a <= x` or `a_new` if `a > x`, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `x <= y` holds true, and `y` is now equal to `a` if `a <= y` or `a_new` if `a > y`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a` simply assigns the value of `a` to `x`. The values of `t`, `inp`, `a_new`, `y`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states.
