Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, `y` is equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The code `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `x` was initially equal to `y`, and there is no integer `a` in `inp` such that `a` is less than or equal to `y`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. Thus, `x` is still equal to `y`, and `y` is now equal to `a`.
