Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is equal to the next element in `inp` (let's call it `a_new`), `y` is either `a` or `a_new` depending on the condition `a <= y`, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a_new <= y` holds true, and `y` is now equal to `a` if the condition `a <= y` is false, otherwise `y` remains `a`.
