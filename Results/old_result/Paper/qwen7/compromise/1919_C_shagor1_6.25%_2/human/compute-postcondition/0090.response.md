Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is the count of unique minimum elements encountered in `inp`, `x` is the overall minimum element in `inp`, `y` is the last unique minimum element encountered in `inp` if there are multiple minimum elements, otherwise `y` is the same as `x` if there is only one minimum element; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns them to the list `inp`. The values of `ans`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
