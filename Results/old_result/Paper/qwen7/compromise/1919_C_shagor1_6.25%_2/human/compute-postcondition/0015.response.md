Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, `ans` is 0, `inp` must have at least one element, and `a > y`.**

Explanation: The line `x == y` is an equality check rather than an assignment. It does not change the values of `x` or `y`; it only checks if they are equal. Since `x` and `y` were both initialized to `n + 1`, they are already equal. The other variables (`ans`, `inp`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
