Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `ans` will be the count of unique minimum elements encountered in `inp`, `x` will be the overall minimum element in `inp`, and `y` will be the last unique minimum element encountered in `inp` if there are multiple minimum elements, otherwise `y` will be the same as `x` if there is only one minimum element.**

In simpler terms, `ans` will count how many times the minimum value in the list `inp` has changed during the loop's iterations. `x` will store the smallest value found in `inp`. `y` will store the last unique minimum value encountered, meaning if there are repeated minimum values, `y` will be the last one among them. If there is only one minimum value throughout the list, both `x` and `y` will be the same.
