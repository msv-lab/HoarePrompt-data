Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

The code `x == y` checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since no assignment or modification is performed on any variable, the values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `inp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the condition `x == y` is evaluated, but no new values are assigned.
