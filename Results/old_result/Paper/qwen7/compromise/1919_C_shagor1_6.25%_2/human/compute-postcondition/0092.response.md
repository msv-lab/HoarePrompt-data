Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is 0, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. The values of the other variables (`inp`, `x`, `y`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
