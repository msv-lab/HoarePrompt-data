Output State: **`inp` is a non-empty list of integers, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `x` is equal to `y`, and `y` is now equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a` to `y`. The value of `a` is the second element in the list `inp`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `x` still being equal to `y`.
