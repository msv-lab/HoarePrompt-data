The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it identifies the minimum and second minimum values in the list, counts the number of unique minimum values, and counts how many elements in the list are greater than the second minimum value. It prints the count of elements greater than the second minimum value for each test case.
