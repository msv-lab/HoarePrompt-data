Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for updating `x` and `y` and incrementing `ans` does not properly account for the penalty calculation.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

The program's output for this case would be `1`, but the correct output should be `0`. Here's why:

- The optimal way to split the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is to have both subsequences `s` and `t` as `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[]` respectively (or vice versa). In this case, the penalty `p(s)` for `s = [1, 2, 3, 4]` is `0` because there are no indices `i` where `s_i < s_{i+1}`. Similarly, the penalty `p(t)` for `t = []` is `0`. Therefore, the total penalty is `0`.

However, the provided program would incorrectly calculate the penalty as `1` because it does not handle the optimal splitting correctly. It increments `ans` whenever an element is greater than both `x` and `y`, which is not the intended behavior for calculating the minimum penalty.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
