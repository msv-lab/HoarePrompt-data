Output State: `testcases` must be greater than or equal to 3.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `testcases` must be at least 3, as it had to be greater than 1 after 3 iterations and can only decrease or stay the same if it were modified within the loop, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the final value of `testcases` must be greater than or equal to 3.
