Postcondition: **The loop has terminated because `l` is equal to `h`. At this point, `l` and `h` define the boundaries of the search range where the optimal solution is found, `ans` contains the best result obtained, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` reflect the sums `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the last valid midpoint `mid`, and `h` is `l - 1`. The variables `left` and `right` retain their values from the final iteration, and `f` is the last element in `F` (denoted as `f_next`) processed by the loop.**
