Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code reassigns the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. The values of `mid`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
