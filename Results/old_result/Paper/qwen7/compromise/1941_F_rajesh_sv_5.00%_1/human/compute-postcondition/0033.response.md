Postcondition: `max_diff` is equal to the maximum difference encountered so far, `next_max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `index` is either the current index `i` or remains `None`, `diff` is updated to `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.
