Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while l < h`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `l` and `h`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
   - `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`
   - `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `h`.
   - Since the condition `l < h` is checked at the start of each iteration, we need to ensure that this condition holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - If `l` is already less than `h`, no adjustment is needed for `l`.
   - We need to ensure that `h` is not equal to `l` for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to guarantee that `l < h`. Given the current state, we need to ensure that `h` is not equal to `l`.

### Final State

State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`**

This ensures that the loop condition `l < h` remains true for the next iteration.
