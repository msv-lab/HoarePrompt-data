The loop condition is `l < h`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l < h` must remain true. Let's analyze the given postconditions and determine which states need to be adjusted.

Given:
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
- `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`

The loop updates `l` or `h` based on the comparison `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `l < h`. This means we need to ensure that after the update, `l` remains less than `h`.

Let's consider the two possible updates:
1. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`.
2. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.

In both cases, we need to ensure that `l < h` holds true. The only way to guarantee this is to ensure that the current values of `l` and `h` satisfy `l < h` before the update.

Since the loop condition is `l < h`, and no other states are mentioned in the loop head, we do not need to adjust any other states.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `h`, but they must already satisfy the condition `l < h` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `l < h` must hold true**
