Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `mid`, `l` is an integer less than `h`.**

Explanation: The code `h = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to `h`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
