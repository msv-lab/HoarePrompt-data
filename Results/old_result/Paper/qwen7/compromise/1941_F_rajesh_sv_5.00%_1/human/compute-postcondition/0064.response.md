Output State: `l` is greater than or equal to `h`.

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the condition `l < h` becomes false, meaning `l` has either become equal to or exceeded `h`. The loop continues to narrow down the range between `l` and `h` until no more narrowing is possible under the given condition, thus ensuring `l` is no longer less than `h`.
