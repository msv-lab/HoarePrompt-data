Postcondition: **`max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is `None`, `A` is assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`. If `diff > next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.**
