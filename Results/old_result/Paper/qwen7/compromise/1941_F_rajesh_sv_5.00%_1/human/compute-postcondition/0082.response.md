Output State: **`l` must be less than `h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `h` using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`. This formula ensures that `mid` is an integer and is the floor division of the average of `l` and `h`. The condition that `l` must be less than `h` remains unchanged.
