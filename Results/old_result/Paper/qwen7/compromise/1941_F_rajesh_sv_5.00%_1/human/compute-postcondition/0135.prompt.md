Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop finishes, `max_diff` will hold the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `A`, `next_max_diff` will hold the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `A` (or remain `-inf` if no such difference exists), `index` will hold the index where `max_diff` was found (or remain `None` if `max_diff` did not change), `diff`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `left`, and `right` will retain their values after the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l` is equal to `h`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` holds the minimum value of `ans` updated during each iteration, considering the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` reflect the sums `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the last valid `mid` value, and `left` and `right` retain their values from the final iteration, `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `l` and `h` define the boundaries of the search range where the optimal solution is found, `ans` contains the best result obtained, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` reflect the sums `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the last valid midpoint `mid`, and `f` is the last element in `F` (denoted as `f_next`) processed by the loop. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`, `l` is equal to `h`, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, `h` is `l - 1`, and `left` and `right` retain their values from the final iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
