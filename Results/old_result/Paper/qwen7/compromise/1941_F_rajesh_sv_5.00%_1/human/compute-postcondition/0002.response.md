Output State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_6()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `func_6()` is provided, we cannot determine any changes to the variables. The only precondition is that `testcases` must be greater than 0, which remains unchanged after calling the function.
