Postcondition: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is `-inf` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it is updated to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`. `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`. `A`, `diff`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`**.
