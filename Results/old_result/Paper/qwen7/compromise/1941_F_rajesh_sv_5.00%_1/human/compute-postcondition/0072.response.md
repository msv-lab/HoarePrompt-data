Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given Program State:
- `l` is equal to the index returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`
- `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`
- `f` is the next element in `F`

### While Loop Condition:
```
while l < h:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `l` is determined by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`.
   - `h` is determined by `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l < h` must be true initially.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - `l` is dependent on `left - f` and `D`.
   - `h` is dependent on `right - f` and `D`.

To ensure `l < h` initially, we need to make sure that the values of `left - f` and `right - f` are such that `bisect_right(D, left - f)` is less than `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

Given the nature of the `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` functions, we need to ensure that there exists at least one element in `D` between `left - f` and `right - f`.

### Conclusion:
The only states that need to be adjusted are related to the values of `left` and `right` relative to `f`. Specifically, `left` and `right` should be chosen such that there is at least one element in `D` between `left - f` and `right - f`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` is equal to the index returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `f` is the next element in `F`, and `left` and `right` must be chosen such that there is at least one element in `D` between `left - f` and `right - f`**.
