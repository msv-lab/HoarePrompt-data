Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It then counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters (`P - M`).

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The penalty for a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - If we only consider the difference between the counts of '+' and '-', this does not account for the actual sums of subarrays and their lengths.
   - For example, in the third test case `--+++++++-`, the optimal split would be `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of 0. However, the given program would incorrectly calculate the penalty as `2 - 8 = -6`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
