Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(P - M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `P` will be equal to the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` will be equal to the total number of '-' (or any other character) in the string `e`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, `M` is the total number of '-' or any other character in the original string `e`, `i` is still equal to the input value `N`, `N` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, and `e` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final output state will be that `e` is the entire input string, `P` is equal to the total number of '+' characters in the string, and `M` is equal to the total number of characters in the string that are not '+'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
