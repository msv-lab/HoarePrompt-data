Output State: **`P` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is the total number of '-' or any other character in the string `e`, `i` is equal to the input value `N`, `N` is replaced by the integer input, `s` is an integer input, and `e` is the string input.**

Explanation: The code `e = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `e`. The values of `P`, `M`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
