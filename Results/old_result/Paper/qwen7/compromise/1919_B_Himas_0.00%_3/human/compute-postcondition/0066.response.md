Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for q in e:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `e`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `e`. The variable `q` represents each character in the string `e` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `e` is an input string with at least one character.
   - `P` is 2 if `q` was '+'.
   - `M` is 2 if `q` was not '+'.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are characters left in `e`, the string `e` must have at least two characters for the loop to execute one more time.
   - The variable `q` will now represent the next character in the string `e`.
   - If the next character `q` is '+', then `P` will be 2.
   - If the next character `q` is not '+', then `M` will be 2.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `e` must have at least two characters (since one character was already processed).
   - `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.
   - `P` will be 2 if `q` is '+'.
   - `M` will be 2 if `q` is not '+'.

Given this reasoning, the new state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`e` is a string with at least two characters, `q` is the second character in the string, `P` is 2 if `q` is '+', and `M` is 2 if `q` is not '+'**.
