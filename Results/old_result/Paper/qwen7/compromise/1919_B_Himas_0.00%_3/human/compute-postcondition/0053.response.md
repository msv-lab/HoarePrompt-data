Output State: **`P` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `M` is 0, `i` is `N + 1`, `N` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `e` is now the input string, and we have read the input string.**

Explanation: The line `M = 0` sets the variable `M` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
