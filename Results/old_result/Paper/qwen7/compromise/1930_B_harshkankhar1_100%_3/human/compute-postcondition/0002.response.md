Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list where every second element starting from the first (index 0) is reversed.

Let's break down the list `a`:
- The list `a` has elements at even indices (0-based) that are reversed.
- For example, if `a = [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, ...]`, then `a1`, `a3`, `a5`, etc., are reversed.

Since the exact values of `a` are not specified, we can only describe the structure of the list `a` and how it is printed.

The `print(*a)` statement will unpack the list `a` and print its elements separated by spaces.

Output: **a0 a1_reversed a2 a3_reversed a4 ... (where a1_reversed, a3_reversed, a5_reversed, etc., are the reversed versions of a1, a3, a5, etc.)**
