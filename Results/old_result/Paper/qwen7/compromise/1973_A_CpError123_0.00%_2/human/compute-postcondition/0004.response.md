Output State: **The program returns a list of non-negative integers or -1 based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each element in the list corresponds to the evaluation of each inner list in `cas_de_test`, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.**

This means that for each inner list in `cas_de_test`, the program evaluates the conditions and appends either a non-negative integer or -1 to the `resultats` list based on those conditions. The exact values in `resultats` depend on the specific values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` in each inner list of `cas_de_test`.
