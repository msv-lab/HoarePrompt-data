Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` correctly handles the input parameters `t` and `cas_de_test`.
2. For each test case, the function calculates the total points and checks if they are even. If not, it immediately returns `-1` because an odd total points cannot be formed by the given scoring rules.
3. It then calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) from the total points.
4. It checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it returns `-1` because these scenarios are not possible under the given constraints.
5. It calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites // 2`, where `egalites` is derived from the differences in scores and the total points.
6. The provided example cases in the execution summary match the expected outputs based on the logic implemented in the function.

Given this analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
