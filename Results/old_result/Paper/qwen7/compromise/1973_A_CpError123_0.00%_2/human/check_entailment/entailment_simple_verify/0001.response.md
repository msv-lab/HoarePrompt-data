### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and defines a list `cas_de_test` containing predefined test cases. This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `t` and `cas_de_test` as input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case `(p1, p2, p3)`, it calculates the total points (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks if the total points are even (`if total_points % 2 != 0`). If not, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - It calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`). This calculation is correct.
   - It checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 or if `p3` is greater than the total number of matches (`if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`). If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and then divides by 2 to get the number of draws (`egalites // 2`). This calculation is correct.
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - Otherwise, it appends the number of draws to the results.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling part is hardcoded with `t = 7` and a fixed list `cas_de_test`. The problem statement specifies that `t` can be any value between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test` should be read from standard input. The current implementation does not handle this dynamic input.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The test cases are processed correctly, but the logic for calculating the number of draws has some potential issues:
     - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` assumes that the difference in points between players can be directly translated into the number of draws. However, this formula does not account for the possibility of multiple games between the same pair of players.
     - The division by 2 to get the number of draws might not always yield the correct result because it does not consider the distribution of wins and losses among the games.

3. **Output**:
   - The output is printed correctly using `'\n'.join(map(str, resultats))`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct in identifying the logic for determining the number of draws, but it fails to address the following issues:
- The program does not handle dynamic input for `t` and `cas_de_test`.
- The logic for calculating the number of draws might not be fully accurate due to the assumptions made in the formula.

Given these issues, the program is not entirely correct as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
