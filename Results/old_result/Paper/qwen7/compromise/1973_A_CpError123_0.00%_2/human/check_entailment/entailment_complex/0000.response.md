Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes the number of test cases (`t`) and the test cases themselves (`cas_de_test`).
2. The function `func_1` iterates over each test case and checks the conditions as described in the problem statement.
3. The logic within the function is as follows:
   - Check if the total points are odd. If they are, it's impossible to achieve these scores, so append `-1`.
   - Calculate the total number of matches from the total points.
   - Check if the total number of matches exceeds 3 or if the highest score exceeds the total number of matches. If either condition is true, append `-1`.
   - Calculate the number of draws using the formula derived from the problem constraints.
   - Append the calculated number of draws to the results list.
4. The function correctly handles all the test cases provided in the example, producing the expected outputs.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
