Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation and Total Points Calculation**: 
   - The program correctly checks if the total points (`total_points`) are even, which is necessary because the sum of points from games must be even.
   - It calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as half of the total points.

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The program checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an impossible scenario.

3. **Calculation of Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - It then checks if this value is negative. If it is, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an impossible scenario.
   - Otherwise, it divides the `egalites` by 2 to get the number of draws and appends this value to the results.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided in the annotated program match the problem statement and are correctly evaluated by the function.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each test case and handles invalid scenarios appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
