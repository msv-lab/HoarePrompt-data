Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `value` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For each iteration, `value` is set to the current element of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `value` is the first element of `a`.
   - If `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `value` is set to the current element of the list `a` in each iteration, after the first iteration, `value` will be the second element of `a`.
   - The list `a` remains the same as it was at the beginning of the loop.
   - The variable `greater_count` will either remain unchanged or be incremented by 1 depending on the comparison with `favorite_value` in the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
- `value` should now be the second element of `a`.
- `a` remains the same.
- `greater_count` may or may not have changed, but since we are only asked to adjust the states in the loop head, we focus on `value` and `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `value` is the second element of `a`**
