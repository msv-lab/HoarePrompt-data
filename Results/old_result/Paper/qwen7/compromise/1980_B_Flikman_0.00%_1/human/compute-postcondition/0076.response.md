Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list, `value` is the first element of `a`, and if the first element of `a` (which is `value`) is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is incremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is not greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` remains unchanged.
