Output State: **`same_value_count` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, `greater_count` is the total count of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `k` is the threshold value, and `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `same_value_count = 0` initializes the variable `same_value_count` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
