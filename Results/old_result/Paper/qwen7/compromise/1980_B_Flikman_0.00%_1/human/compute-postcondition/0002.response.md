Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are now specific integers obtained from the input.
