The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \). It constructs a list \( p \) of length \( n \), where every even index is filled with the value \( 1 + 2 \times \left(\frac{\text{index} - 1}{2}\right) \) and every odd index is filled with the value \( 1 + 2 \times \left(\frac{\text{index}}{2}\right) \) if the index is less than \( n \) and 0 otherwise. After processing all test cases, it prints the list \( p \) for each test case.
