Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1000; `i` is `n-1`; `p[i]` is `ind + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`; `ind` is `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 2 each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`. Since `n` is always greater than or equal to 1000, the loop will run exactly `((n-1)//2)` times. Each iteration sets `p[i]` to the current value of `ind`, which starts at 1 and increases by 2 with each iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `p[i]` will be `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`, and `ind` will also be `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ind` is 9, `i` is 7, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `p[5]` is 5, `p[7]` is 7.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `ind` by 2 and assigns the current value of `ind` to `p[i]` for each odd `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1`. Given the pattern and the information provided, after the loop completes its iterations, `ind` will be 9 (since it starts at 3 and increments by 2 each time, 3 + 2*4 = 9), and `i` will be 7 (the last odd number less than `n` if `n` is 8). The list `p` will have non-zero values at indices 1, 3, 5, and 7, corresponding to the values assigned in each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `ind` is `n+1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 2 each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`. Given that the loop has executed three times, incrementing `i` by 2 each time, we can deduce that `n` must be at least 11 (since it starts at 1 and increments by 2 each iteration). After 3 iterations, `i` would be 5, and since the loop continues to increment `i` by 2, the next value of `i` before the loop exits would be `n-1`. The variable `ind` starts at 1 and is incremented by 2 each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `ind` would be 7. Continuing the pattern, after all iterations, `ind` would be `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
