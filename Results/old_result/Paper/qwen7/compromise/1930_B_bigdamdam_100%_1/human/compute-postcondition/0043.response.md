Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `p[0]` is `n`, `ind` is `n - 6`, `p[2]` is `n - 2`, `p[4]` is `n - 4`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` was equal to `n - 4`. After decrementing by 2, `ind` becomes `n - 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
