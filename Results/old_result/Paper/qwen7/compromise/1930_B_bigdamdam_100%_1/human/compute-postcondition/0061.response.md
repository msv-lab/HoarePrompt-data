Output State: **`ind` is 11, `i` is 8, `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The length of the list is determined by the value of `n`, which is an input integer. The values of `ind` and `i` remain unchanged.
