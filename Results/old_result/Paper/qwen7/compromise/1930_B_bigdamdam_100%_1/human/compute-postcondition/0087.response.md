Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 10
- `ind` is `n+1`

Given that the loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration and has executed three times, we can deduce the following:

1. Since the loop has executed three times, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 each time, the value of `i` before the loop exits would be `n-1`. This means that `n` must be at least 7 (since 1 + 2*3 = 7), but since `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `n` is actually 11 (the smallest number greater than or equal to 10 that fits the pattern).

2. The variable `ind` starts at 1 and is incremented by 2 each iteration. After 3 iterations, `ind` would be `1 + 2*3 = 7`. Therefore, `ind` is 7.

3. Since `i` is `n-1` and `n` is 11, `i` is `11-1 = 10`.

4. The variable `p` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but since the code snippet only references `i` and `ind`, and no other variables, we can infer that `p` might be a list or tuple containing `i` and `ind`.

Therefore, `p` is likely a list or tuple with the values `[10, 7]`.

Output: **10 7**
