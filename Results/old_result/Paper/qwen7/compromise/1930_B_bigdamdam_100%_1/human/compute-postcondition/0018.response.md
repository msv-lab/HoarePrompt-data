Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the step value `2` (though the step value is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, it is implied).

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given information, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n` if `n` is even.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2)` will execute as long as `1 <= i < n` with a step of `2`.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: Since the loop requires `1 <= i < n`, `n` must be greater than `1`. Additionally, `n` must be an even number greater than or equal to the largest even number less than or equal to 1000, which is 1000 itself.

5. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Given the initial value of `i` and the loop condition, `i` should be set to the starting point of the loop, which is `1` if `n` is even or `2` if `n` is odd. However, since `i` is initialized based on `n`, we need to ensure that `i` starts from `1` when the loop begins.

6. **Other variables**: The variables `ind`, `p[0]`, `p[2]`, ..., `p[n-2]` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1000 and `i` is 1**
