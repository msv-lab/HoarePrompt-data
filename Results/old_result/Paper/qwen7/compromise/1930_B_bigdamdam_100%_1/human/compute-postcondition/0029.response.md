Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1000.
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.
   - `p[i]` is set to `ind + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.
   - `ind` is set to `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`.
   - Since `n` is always greater than or equal to 1000, the loop will run exactly `((n-1)//2)` times.
   - Each iteration sets `p[i]` to the current value of `ind`, which starts at `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)` and increases by 2 with each iteration.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`.
   - `p[i]` will be `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.
   - `ind` will also be `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(*p)` will print the contents of the list `p`.

Given that `n` is at least 1000, let's calculate the exact value of `p[i]`:
- `i = n - 1`.
- `p[i] = ind + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.
- `ind = 1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.

Substituting `ind` into the equation for `p[i]`:
\[ p[i] = 1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2) + 2 * ((n-1)//2) = 1 + 4 * ((n-1)//2) \]

Since `n` is at least 1000, `((n-1)//2)` is at least 499. Therefore:
\[ p[i] = 1 + 4 * 499 = 1 + 1996 = 1997 \]

Thus, `p[i]` is 1997, and since `i` is `n-1`, the list `p` will have 1997 repeated `((n-1)//2)` times.

Output: **1997 1997 ... 1997 (repeated ((n-1)//2) times)**
