Output State: `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n` if `n` is even, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `p[0]` is `n`, `ind` is `0`, `p` is a list of length `n` where every index `i` (for even `i` starting from 0) is set to `n - 2 * (i // 2)`, and all other elements remain `0`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `p` will have non-zero values only at even indices, starting from `p[0]` down to `p[n-2]` if `n` is even, or `p[n-1]` if `n` is odd. Each value at these indices will be `n` minus twice the index position divided by two. The variable `ind` will be `0` since it decreases by `2` in each iteration until it reaches `0`.
