Based on the initial state provided:

- `ind` is 9
- `i` is 7
- `p[1]` is 1
- `p[3]` is 3
- `p[5]` is 5
- `p[7]` is 7

The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces. Since the list `p` has non-zero values only at indices 1, 3, 5, and 7, and these values are explicitly given, the output will be those values in order.

Output: **1 3 5 7**
