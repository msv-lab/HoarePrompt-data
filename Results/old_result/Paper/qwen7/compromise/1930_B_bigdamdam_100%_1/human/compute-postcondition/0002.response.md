Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. `n` retains its value as the first integer from the input.
