Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is `ind - 2`**.

The value of `ind` is decreased by 2, while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
