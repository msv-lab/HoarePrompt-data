Output State: **`thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2, `ret` is the total number of '@' encountered across all iterations, and `i` is the last character processed in the last list `s`.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `thorn` will be 0 if it was reset to 0 inside the loop (due to encountering '@') or if it never reached 2 before the loop broke. It will be 1 if it was incremented to 2 and then reset to 0 due to encountering '*' twice in any of the strings. The variable `ret` will be the sum of all occurrences of '@' across all input strings, as it increments by 1 each time an '@' is encountered. The variable `i` will be the last character processed in the last list `s` that was iterated over.
