Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `thorn`, `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `i` retain their original values if `i` is not '@'.
   - If `i` is '@', `thorn` is set to 0.
   - If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 2; otherwise, `thorn` is set to 1.
   - The loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in s:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - The loop condition is based on the value of `i`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is not a specific character (like '@' or '*') that causes the loop to break.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`.
   - The other variables (`thorn`, `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`) retain their original values unless modified inside the loop, but since no modifications are mentioned, they remain unchanged.
   - The loop will continue until it encounters a specific character that causes it to break.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be a valid character in the string `s` that does not cause an immediate break.
   - If `i` is not '@' or '*', then `thorn` retains its original value.
   - If `i` is '@', `thorn` is set to 0.
   - If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 2.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we assume it did not cause a break and proceed with the general case where `i` is neither '@' nor '*'.

**Final State:**
- `thorn` retains its original value.
- `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret` retain their original values.
- `i` is the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`thorn` retains its original value, `t` retains its original value, `len` retains its original value, `s` retains its original value, `ret` retains its original value, `i` is the next character in the string `s`**
