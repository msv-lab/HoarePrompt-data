Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers converted from space-separated integers input by the user, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to a string, and then maps those strings to integers, creating a list of integers. The original values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The list `l` is updated with the new list of integers.
