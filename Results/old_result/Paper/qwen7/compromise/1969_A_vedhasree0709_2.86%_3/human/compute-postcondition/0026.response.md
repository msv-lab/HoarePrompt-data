Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` can be any integer as long as it is non-negative (since `i` starts at 0 and increments until it reaches `n-1`), `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n-1`. Once `i` equals `n`, the condition `i <= n - 1` becomes false, and the loop terminates. Since the loop breaks when the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met, `j` remains 1 throughout the loop's execution. All other variables' states remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
