Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that the initial state of `i` was 3, after executing the code, `i` becomes 4. The condition for `n` remains unchanged as the code does not affect `n`. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.
