Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. Otherwise, the same conditions hold as the precondition.**
