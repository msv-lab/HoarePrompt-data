Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers, `j` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is a positive integer greater than 0) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `l`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
