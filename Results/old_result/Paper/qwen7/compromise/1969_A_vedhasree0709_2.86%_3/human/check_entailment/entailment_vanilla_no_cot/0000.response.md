Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The current logic checks only two consecutive elements in the list `l` to see if they satisfy a specific condition (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`). This is overly restrictive and does not cover all possible scenarios where the minimum number of invitations needed could be 2 or 3.

2. **Handling All Scenarios**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations such that at least 2 friends come to the party. The logic needs to account for various configurations of the best friends' pairs.

3. **Edge Cases**: The current implementation fails to handle edge cases like when the sequence of best friends forms cycles or when the best friends form a single cycle.

### Correct Solution:
A more robust approach would involve identifying cycles in the best friends' relationships and ensuring that at least one friend from each cycle receives an invitation. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Create a dictionary to map each friend to their best friend
        best_friends = {i + 1: l[i] for i in range(n)}
        
        # Function to find the cycle starting from a given friend
        def find_cycle(start):
            visited = set()
            cycle = []
            current = start
            while current not in visited:
                visited.add(current)
                cycle.append(current)
                current = best_friends[current]
            return cycle
        
        # Find all cycles
        cycles = []
        remaining_friends = set(range(1, n + 1))
        while remaining_friends:
            start = next(iter(remaining_friends))
            cycle = find_cycle(start)
            cycles.append(cycle)
            remaining_friends -= set(cycle)
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of invitations
        min_invitations = float('inf')
        for cycle in cycles:
            if len(cycle) >= 2:
                # If the cycle has at least 2 friends, we need to invite both
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, len(cycle))
            else:
                # If the cycle has only 1 friend, we need to invite this friend and one friend from another cycle
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 2)
        
        print(min_invitations)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution correctly identifies cycles and calculates the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
