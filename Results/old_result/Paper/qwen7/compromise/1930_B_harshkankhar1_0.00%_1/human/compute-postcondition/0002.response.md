Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive), and every second element in `a` is reversed.

Let's break down the list `a`:
- The list `a` initially contains integers from 1 to `t` in order: `[1, 2, 3, ..., t]`.
- Every second element in this list is reversed, meaning the elements at even indices (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) are swapped with their corresponding elements from the end of the list.

For example, if `t = 5`, then the list `a` would be:
- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- After reversing every second element: `[1, 5, 3, 4, 2]`

In general, the list `a` will look like this after the reversal:
- The odd-indexed elements remain unchanged.
- The even-indexed elements are replaced with the elements from the end of the list.

Thus, the list `a` will be:
\[ [1, t, 3, t-1, 5, t-2, \ldots] \]

When the `print(a)` statement is executed, it will print the list `a` in this form.

Output: **[1, t, 3, t-1, 5, t-2, ...]**
