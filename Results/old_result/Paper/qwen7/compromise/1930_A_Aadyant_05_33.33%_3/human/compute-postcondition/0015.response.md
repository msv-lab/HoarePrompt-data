Output State: **`a` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `list2` contains the integer value of the element at index 8 from `list1`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `a` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `list2` contains the integer value of the element at index 4 from `list1`.
- The code `list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))` appends to `list2` the integer value of the element at index `2 * i` from `list1`. Since `i` is 3, `2 * i` equals 6. Therefore, `list2` now contains the integer value of the element at index 6 from `list1`, and the element at index 4 from `list1` is still in `list2`.

So, `list2` now contains the integer value of the element at index 8 from `list1` (since the original index was 4 and it got updated to 6), and the rest of the conditions remain the same.
