Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input integer, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

The code `num = input()` assigns the input value to the variable `num`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the numbers on the whiteboard are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `num` now holds the value input by the user.
