Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and n and m are within the limits specified in the problem description.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 64, `m` must be at least 80, `cnt` is 0, `y` is 5.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the loop and its conditions:
    #
    #1. The loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`.
    #2. For each value of `x`, it initializes `y` to 1 and checks the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
    #3. If both conditions are met and `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
    #4. It then increments `y` until the second condition fails.
    #5. Finally, it increments `x` and repeats the process.
    #
    #From the given information:
    #- After the first iteration (`x = 2`), `cnt` is 10.
    #- After the second iteration (`x = 3`), `cnt` is 6.
    #- After the third iteration (`x = 4`), `cnt` is 1.
    #
    #Since `cnt` decreases with each additional iteration, and the loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`, we can infer that `n` must be large enough to allow `x` to reach 5 before the condition `x * x > n` becomes true. Given the pattern, `m` must also be large enough to accommodate the increasing values of `x` and `y`.
    #
    #By the fourth iteration (`x = 5`), the loop will stop because `5 * 5 = 25` which is less than or equal to `n`, but `6 * 6 = 36` which would exceed `n`. At this point, no further contributions to `cnt` are made since `x` has reached the limit where `x * x > n`. Therefore, `cnt` remains at 1 from the third iteration.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the count of pairs (x, y) such that \(1 \leq x, y\) and \( (x + y) \cdot x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \leq m \), where \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from input, and iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to find valid pairs, incrementing a counter for each valid pair found. The function finally prints the total count of such pairs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and n + m does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t must be greater than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( m \) such that \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and \( n + m \) does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^6 \). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the initial integer \( t \) (indicating the number of test cases) is greater than 2. The function does not return any value.
