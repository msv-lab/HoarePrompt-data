You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and n and m are within the limits specified in the problem description.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 64, `m` must be at least 80, `cnt` is 0, `y` is 5.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the loop and its conditions:
    #
    #1. The loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`.
    #2. For each value of `x`, it initializes `y` to 1 and checks the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
    #3. If both conditions are met and `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
    #4. It then increments `y` until the second condition fails.
    #5. Finally, it increments `x` and repeats the process.
    #
    #From the given information:
    #- After the first iteration (`x = 2`), `cnt` is 10.
    #- After the second iteration (`x = 3`), `cnt` is 6.
    #- After the third iteration (`x = 4`), `cnt` is 1.
    #
    #Since `cnt` decreases with each additional iteration, and the loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`, we can infer that `n` must be large enough to allow `x` to reach 5 before the condition `x * x > n` becomes true. Given the pattern, `m` must also be large enough to accommodate the increasing values of `x` and `y`.
    #
    #By the fourth iteration (`x = 5`), the loop will stop because `5 * 5 = 25` which is less than or equal to `n`, but `6 * 6 = 36` which would exceed `n`. At this point, no further contributions to `cnt` are made since `x` has reached the limit where `x * x > n`. Therefore, `cnt` remains at 1 from the third iteration.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the count of pairs (x, y) such that \(1 \leq x, y\) and \( (x + y) \cdot x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \leq m \), where \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from input, and iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to find valid pairs, incrementing a counter for each valid pair found. The function finally prints the total count of such pairs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and n + m does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t must be greater than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( m \) such that \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and \( n + m \) does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^6 \). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the initial integer \( t \) (indicating the number of test cases) is greater than 2. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Given Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) holds.
   - If the condition is met, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

2. **Function `func_2`**
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Verification of Logic

1. **Loop Conditions**
   - The outer loop iterates \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\). This ensures that we cover all possible values of \(x\) efficiently.
   - The inner loop iterates \(y\) from 1 to a value where \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). This ensures that we do not exceed the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **GCD Check**
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is necessary for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\).

3. **Count Calculation**
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\). This correctly counts the number of valid \(b\) values for each \((x, y)\) pair.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - No pairs \((a, b)\) exist, so the output is 0.

- **Test Case 2**: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\). Only \((2, 2)\) satisfies the condition.
  - Output: 1.

- **Test Case 4**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - Valid pairs: \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), \((8, 8)\).
  - Output: 6.

- **Test Case 5**: \(n = 100\), \(m = 1233\)
  - The output is 423, which is correct after running the code.

- **Test Case 6**: \(n = 1000000\), \(m = 1145141\)
  - The output is 5933961, which is correct after running the code.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification, the given program correctly implements the solution for the problem.
