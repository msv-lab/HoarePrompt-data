Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq \sqrt{n}\) and \(1 \leq y \leq \frac{n}{x} - x\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = y\).
   - It counts the number of valid pairs by considering the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x+y)x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them and calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Given Execution States**:
   - The execution state provided shows that `func_1` correctly computes the count of valid pairs for a specific test case when \(n = 64\) and \(m = 80\), resulting in `cnt = 1`.
   - This matches the expected behavior of the function based on the problem constraints and the provided example.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program structure is correct and follows the problem requirements.
   - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.
   - The logic inside `func_1` appears to be correctly implemented based on the provided execution state.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
