Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Analysis

We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Given Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `x` starts from 1 and increments up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - For each value of `x`, it checks values of `y` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - For each `y`, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\). If true, it calculates the contribution to `cnt` using:
     - `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`
   - This calculation ensures that the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is met.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the total count of valid pairs after processing all possible pairs.

#### Function `func_2`
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that:
1. The logic inside `func_1` correctly counts the number of valid pairs.
2. The implementation handles the constraints and edge cases properly.

#### Edge Cases and Constraints
- The constraints are \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) with the sum of \(n\) and \(m\) not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^6\).
- The solution should efficiently handle large inputs without exceeding time limits.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No pairs \((a, b)\) exist since \(1 \leq a \leq 1\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 1\).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Valid pair: \((2, 2)\) because \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 2 = 4\).

3. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `10 8`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Valid pairs: \((2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3), (6, 6), (8, 8)\).

After analyzing the code and verifying with the examples, the logic appears to be correct and efficient within the given constraints.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the required logic and handles the constraints appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
