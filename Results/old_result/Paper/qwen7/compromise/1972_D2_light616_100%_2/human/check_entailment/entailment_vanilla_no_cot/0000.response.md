Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down why:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` aims to iterate through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\).
   - However, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` is problematic because it does not ensure that the product \((x + y) \cdot \gcd(x, y)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **GCD Condition:**
   - The problem requires checking if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The current implementation does not properly handle this condition.

3. **Incorrect GCD Calculation:**
   - The line `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:` checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is not relevant to the problem. It should check the condition involving \(\gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Range and Step Size:**
   - The ranges and steps in the loops do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) efficiently and correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Function calls (for testing purposes)
# func_2()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the required condition directly, ensuring correctness.
