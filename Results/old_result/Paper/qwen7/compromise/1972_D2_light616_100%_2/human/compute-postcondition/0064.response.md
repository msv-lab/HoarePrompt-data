Based on the initial state and the behavior of the loop described, we know the following:

- `x` is 5.
- `n` must be at least 64 (since the loop continues as long as `x * x <= n` and the largest `x` considered is 5).
- `m` must be at least 80.
- `cnt` is 1 after the third iteration.
- The loop stops when `x` reaches 5 because `5 * 5 = 25` is still less than or equal to `n`, but `6 * 6 = 36` would exceed `n`.

Given these details, after the loop completes, the value of `cnt` is 1. This is because the loop increments `cnt` up to the third iteration and does not contribute any more to `cnt` once `x` reaches 5.

Output: **1**
