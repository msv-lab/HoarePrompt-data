Output State: `x` is 1, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 30, `cnt` is 10, `y` is 5.

Explanation: Based on the given information, we can see that for each iteration, both `n` and `m` increase in such a way that they are multiples of the previous values. Specifically, for each increment of `y`, `n` and `m` are updated to ensure `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. After 4 iterations, `y` becomes 5. The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` holds true for `x = 1` and `y = 5` since their greatest common divisor is 1. Therefore, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which results in `cnt` being 10 when `y` reaches 5. The minimum values for `n` and `m` that satisfy the conditions after 4 iterations are 10 and 30, respectively.
