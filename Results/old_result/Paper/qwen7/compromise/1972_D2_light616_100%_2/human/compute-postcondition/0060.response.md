Output State: `x` is 3, `n` is at least 27, `y` is 5, `m` is at least 27, and `cnt` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that:

- After the first iteration, `x` remains 3, `n` is at least 12, `y` becomes 2, and `cnt` is incremented to 1 because the gcd of 3 and 2 is 1.
- After the second iteration, `x` remains 3, `n` is still at least 12, `y` becomes 3, and `m` is at least 10.
- After the third iteration, `x` remains 3, `n` is at least 18, `y` becomes 4, and `m` is at least 18. Since the gcd of 3 and 4 is 1, `cnt` is set to 1.

To find the final state, we need to determine when the loop will terminate. Given the conditions, the loop will continue until `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. With `x` fixed at 3, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` simplifies to `(3 + y) * 3 <= n`. The smallest `y` that would make this false is 6, since `(3 + 6) * 3 = 27 > 24` (assuming `n` was 24 initially). Similarly, `(x + y) * y <= m` simplifies to `(3 + y) * y <= m`. The smallest `y` that would make this false is also 6, since `(3 + 6) * 6 = 54 > 48` (assuming `m` was 48 initially).

Therefore, the loop will execute until `y` reaches 6. At `y = 6`, both conditions become false, so the loop terminates. Thus, `x` remains 3, `n` is at least 27, `y` is 5 (since it increments from 4 to 5 before the loop condition fails), and `m` is at least 27. The value of `cnt` remains 1 as it is only incremented once per iteration and does not change after the loop.
