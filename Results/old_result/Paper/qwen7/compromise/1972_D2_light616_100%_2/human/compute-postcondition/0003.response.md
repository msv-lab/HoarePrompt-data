The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a placeholder variable used when the variable name is not needed) and `t`. Since the placeholder variable `_` does not affect the loop's condition, we only need to focus on adjusting the state of `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 because the loop runs `t` times.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
