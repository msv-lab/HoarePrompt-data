Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the function definition does not include any parameters, the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and therefore has no input to process. Since there are no return statements or outputs mentioned, the function does not return anything either.
