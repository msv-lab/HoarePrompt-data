Output State: **`x` is 3, `n` is at least 12, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is 1 if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The initial conditions state that `x` is 3, `n` is at least 12, and `y` is 1. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` (which is 3) and `y` (now 2) is 1, then `cnt` is set to 1. Since the GCD of 3 and 2 is indeed 1, `cnt` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
