Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is 0 + min(n // (2 * 1), m // (2 * 1)), and `y` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
