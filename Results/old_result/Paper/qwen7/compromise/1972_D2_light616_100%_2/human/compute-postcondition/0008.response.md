Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it also processes two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and ensures that n + m does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases. The function returns the results of processing each test case.**

This means the function `func_2` does not directly accept any parameters but is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, each containing specific ranges of integers `t`, `n`, and `m`. It processes these values according to the given constraints and returns the outcomes of these operations.
