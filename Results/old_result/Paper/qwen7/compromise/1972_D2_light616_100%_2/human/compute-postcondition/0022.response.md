Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 10
   - `m` must be at least 30 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)
   - `cnt` is 10 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)
   - `y` is 5 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 2.
   - We need to check if `x * x <= n` holds true.
   - Since `x` is 2, `x * x` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `4 <= n` must be true.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The loop condition depends on `x` and `n`.
   - `x` is already 2, so we don't need to change it.
   - `n` must be at least 10, but since `4 <= n` must hold true, `n` must be at least 5.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 5 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be at least 5.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 30, `cnt` is 10, `y` is 5**
