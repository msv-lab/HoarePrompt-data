Output State: **`x` is 4, `n` is at least 27, `y` is 5, `m` is at least 27, and `cnt` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Initially, `x` is 3, so after executing this line, `x` becomes 4. The values of `n`, `y`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` is still at least 27, `y` is still 5, `m` is still at least 27, and `cnt` is still 1.
