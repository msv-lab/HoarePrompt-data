Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 30, `cnt` is 10, `y` is 5**.

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Initially, `x` is 1, so after executing this line, `x` becomes 2. The conditions for the loop to continue (`(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`) still need to be satisfied, meaning `n` must be at least 10 and `m` must be at least 30. The values of `cnt` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
