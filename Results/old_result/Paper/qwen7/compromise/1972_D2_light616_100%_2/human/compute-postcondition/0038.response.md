Output State: `x` is 2, `y` is 6, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 15, and `cnt` is 4.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce the following:

- After the first iteration, `x` remains 2, `y` becomes 2, and `cnt` is incremented to 1.
- After the second iteration, `x` remains 2, `y` becomes 3, and `cnt` is incremented to 1.
- After the third iteration, `x` remains 2, `y` becomes 4, and `cnt` is incremented to 2.

For the fourth iteration, `y` will increment to 5. However, since `n` must be at least 5 and `m` must be at least 30, and given that `(x + y) * x = (2 + 5) * 2 = 14` which is less than 5, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` fails, so the loop terminates. 

Since `math.gcd(2, 5) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) = min(5 // 14, 30 // 10) = min(0, 3) = 0`. Therefore, `cnt` remains 2.

For the fifth iteration, `y` increments to 6. Now, `(x + y) * x = (2 + 6) * 2 = 16` which is still less than 5, so the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` fails again. The loop terminates here as well.

Since `math.gcd(2, 6) != 1`, no change occurs to `cnt`.

Thus, after all iterations, `x` remains 2, `y` is 6, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 15, and `cnt` is 4.
