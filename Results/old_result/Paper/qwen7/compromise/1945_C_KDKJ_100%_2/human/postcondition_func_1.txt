The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. It reads an integer `n` from user input, which must be between 3 and 300,000 inclusive, and then iterates this number of times, calling another function `func_1()` each time. After completing these iterations, the function outputs a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', ensuring that the values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state before the loop begins.
