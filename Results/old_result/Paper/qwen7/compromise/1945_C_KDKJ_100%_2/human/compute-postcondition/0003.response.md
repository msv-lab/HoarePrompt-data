Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 300000.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any parameters but generates a string of length `n` (where `n` is between 3 and 300,000 inclusive) containing only the characters '0' and '1'.
