Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`; `n` is a non-negative integer; `s` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(s)` converts the set `s` into a list. Since `s` was previously a set containing the sum of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`, converting it to a list does not change its content. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
