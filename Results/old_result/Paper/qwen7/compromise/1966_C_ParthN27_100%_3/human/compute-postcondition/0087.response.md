Output State: **`s` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 2`, ans is `ans ^ 1`**

The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans` between 0 and 1 (or 1 and 0). Since no initial value of `ans` is given, we can only say that its value is flipped. The other variables (`s` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
