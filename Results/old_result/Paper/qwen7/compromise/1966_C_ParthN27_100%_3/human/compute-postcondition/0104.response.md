Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` will still be less than `n` (since the loop just finished running with `i` being less than `n`).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The set `s` will remain the same because the loop body is omitted and no operations are specified that would change `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- `s` remains unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is less than `n`
- `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`

After incrementing `i` by 1, the new state will be:
- `i` is now `i + 1` (which is still less than `n`)
- `s` is a set containing `arr[i]` (unchanged)

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is less than `n`, `s` is a set containing `arr[i + 1]`**
