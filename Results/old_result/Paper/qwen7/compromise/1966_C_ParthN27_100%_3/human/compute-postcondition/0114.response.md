Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and the first element of `s` is 0; `ans` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
