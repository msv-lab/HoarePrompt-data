Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s`, `ans` is 1, and `s` is a sorted version of the set containing all elements from the list `arr` with 0 at the beginning. If `n` is 2, then `i` is 2 and `ans` remains 1. If `n` is not 2, then `i` is `n - 1` and `ans` is toggled to 1.
