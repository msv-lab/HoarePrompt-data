Output State: **`s` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s` and `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `ans` is `ans` XOR 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is XORed with 1. The operation `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans` (if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `ans` was 1, it becomes 0). The other variables (`s`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
