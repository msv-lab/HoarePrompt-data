Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is less than or equal to 1, and `ans` is `ans` XOR 1.
