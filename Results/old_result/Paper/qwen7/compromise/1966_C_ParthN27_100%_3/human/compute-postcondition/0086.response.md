Output State: **`s` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `s` or `i`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the initial conditions for `s` and `i` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional statement.
