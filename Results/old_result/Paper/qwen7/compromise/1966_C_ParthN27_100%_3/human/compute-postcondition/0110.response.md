Output State: **`i` is less than `n` and equal to `n-1`; `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `s = list(s)` converts the set `s` into a list. Since `s` originally contained all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, after conversion, `s` will now be a list with the same elements. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still less than `n` and equal to `n-1`.
