Reasoning:
The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case to decode the given encoded string, and outputs the decoded strings. The program correctly implements the decoding logic as per the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into parts using `split()`. This approach ensures that all test cases and their respective encoded strings are read efficiently.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: It iterates through the test cases, reading the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself for each case.
3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` generates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting and removing duplicates from the encoded string.
   - It creates a dictionary `mapping` that maps each character in `r` to its mirrored counterpart.
   - It then decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its corresponding mirrored character using the `mapping` dictionary.
4. **Output**: The decoded strings for all test cases are collected in a list and printed joined by newlines.

Given that the program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
