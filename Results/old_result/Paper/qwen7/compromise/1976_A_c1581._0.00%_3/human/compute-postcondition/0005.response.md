Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string; `last_digit_index` is -1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `last_digit_index`. This does not affect the values of `password`, `digits`, or `letters`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
