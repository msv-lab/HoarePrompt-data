### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Reading Input
- The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits the input into a list called `data`.
- It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `password`) for each case.

#### Processing Each Test Case
- For each test case, it checks if the password meets the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- It separates the password into digits and letters.
- It checks if the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
- It also ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

#### Checking Conditions
- The function `func_1` correctly checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It also correctly identifies if any digit comes after a letter.

### Detailed Checks

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**
   - The code correctly separates digits and letters into two lists (`digits` and `letters`).

2. **Checking Non-Decreasing Order**
   - The code checks if both `digits` and `letters` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This is done using `sorted(digits)` and `sorted(letters)`.

3. **No Digit After Letter**
   - The code maintains a `last_digit_index` to track the last seen digit index.
   - If a letter is encountered after a digit, it immediately returns "NO".

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty Passwords**
   - The provided code handles empty passwords correctly since the sorting check will pass for an empty list.

2. **Passwords with Only Digits or Only Letters**
   - The code correctly handles such cases as well.

### Function Summary Verification
- The function summary states that `func_1` checks if the password meets the specified conditions.
- The function correctly separates the password into digits and letters.
- It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong according to the given conditions. The function `func_1` accurately performs the required checks.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
