Functionality: **The function processes a series of time inputs in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format with AM/PM indicators. It prints each converted time. After processing all inputs, the final state includes `day` set to either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` set to 0, and `h` and `m` both set to 00.**
