Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` is incorrect for determining the maximum number of points you can get. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The program reads input from standard input (since `[*open(0)]` is used), but it does not handle the number of test cases (`t`) or read the input values properly.
2. The logic inside the loop is incorrect. It tries to calculate the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens in a line, which is not relevant to the problem.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read the value of `n` and the list of integers on your cards.
3. Determine the optimal strategy for you to maximize your points while considering Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your points.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        your_cards = [int(data[index + i]) for i in range(n)]
        index += n
        
        # Count occurrences of each card
        card_counts = {}
        for card in your_cards:
            if card in card_counts:
                card_counts[card] += 1
            else:
                card_counts[card] = 1
        
        # Calculate the maximum points you can get
        max_points = 0
        for card in card_counts:
            if card_counts[card] == 2:
                max_points += 1
        
        results.append(max_points)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function
func()
```

This program correctly handles multiple test cases, reads the necessary input, and calculates the maximum points you can get by considering the distribution of cards and the optimal strategies of both players.
