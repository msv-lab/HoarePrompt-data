Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is set to either `low` or `high` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - `cur` is increased by 1 if it was set to `high`.

3. **Determine Which States Need Adjustment**:
   - The loop condition `high >= cur` depends on the values of `high` and `cur`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur` for the loop to continue.

4. **Analyze the Current Values**:
   - From the postconditions, we know `cur` has been updated to either `low` or `high` and then incremented by 1 if it was set to `high`.
   - This means `cur` is now one more than the previous value of `high` if `cur` was set to `high` in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `cur` is incremented by 1 if it was set to `high`, the new value of `cur` is `high + 1`.
   - To ensure `high >= cur`, we need `high` to be at least `cur - 1`, which is `high + 1 - 1 = high`.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur - 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is set to either `low` or `high` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` is increased by 1 if it was set to `high`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur - 1`**.
