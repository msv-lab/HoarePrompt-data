Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with the additional condition that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, and `cur` equals `high`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `cur` will eventually reach the value of `high` because the loop continues to increment `cur` by 1 until the condition `high >= cur` is no longer satisfied. The loop breaks when `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, but since the loop continues as long as `high >= cur`, `cur` will end up being equal to `high` when the loop exits.
