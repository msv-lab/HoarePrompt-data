Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration.
- `p1` is the first integer input.
- `p2` is the second integer input.
- `p3` is the third integer input.

The code snippet provided is simply:
```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur`.

Output: **-1**
