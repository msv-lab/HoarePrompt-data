Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the values of `low` and `high` were being calculated. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and the conditions related to `low` and `high` remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.
