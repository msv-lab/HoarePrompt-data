Output State: **`cur` is less than `high' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `cur` or `high`. It simply exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the only information that changes is that we have exited the loop or conditional.
