Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is increased by 1 if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not met. Otherwise, the loop is exited.

3. **Determine the Next State for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `high >= cur` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since `cur` is increased by 1 if the condition is not met, for the loop to continue, `cur` must be less than `high` at the start of the next iteration. This means that the condition `high >= cur` must still hold true.

Given the current state where `cur` is increased by 1 if the condition is not met, we need to ensure that `cur` is still less than `high` for the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `cur` is less than `high`.

**State Adjustment**:
- The variable `cur` must be less than `high` for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final State**:
State: **`cur` is less than `high`**
