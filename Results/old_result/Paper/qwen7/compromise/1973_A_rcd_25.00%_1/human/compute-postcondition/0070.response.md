Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `cur` will be equal to `high`.

Explanation: Given the conditions and the behavior of the loop, the loop continues to increment `cur` until it no longer satisfies the condition `high >= cur`. The final value of `cur` will be `high - 1` because the loop exits when `cur` reaches `high`, making the condition `high >= cur` false. Since `high` is initially set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` starts at the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` will eventually reach `high - 1` before the loop exits.
