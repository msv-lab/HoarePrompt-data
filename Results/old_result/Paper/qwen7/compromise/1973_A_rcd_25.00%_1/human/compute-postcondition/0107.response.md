Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more inputs to process. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the counter `t` will be reduced to 0, signifying that all input iterations have been processed. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the ones determined during the last pass through the loop, as they are updated within the loop but do not affect the loop's termination condition directly.
