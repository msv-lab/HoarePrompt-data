Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing any further statements within the loop body for the current iteration. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values within the loop body before the `continue` statement, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged from their previous values.
