Output State: The loop will terminate when `cur` exceeds `high`. At this point, the value printed will be `p3`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `cur` will be greater than `high`. According to the loop's condition `while high >= cur`, once `cur` exceeds `high`, the loop will exit. The last action inside the loop is `print(p3)`, which will be executed because the loop's condition fails right after this statement. Therefore, the final output will be `p3`.
