### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is necessary because each game contributes either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw).

3. **Feasibility of Scores:**
   - The program checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of draws. For example, if `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`, the scores can be achieved through one win and one draw, but the current logic would incorrectly print `2` instead of `1`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - If the above condition fails, the program performs a binary search to find the maximum number of draws.
   - The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to the minimum and maximum possible values for the number of draws.
   - A loop is used to incrementally check the number of draws until the condition is met.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to ensure that the scores are achievable with the current number of draws.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop. This logic is also incorrect because it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and edge cases.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Test Case: `1 1 1`**
  - The sum is even, but `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should handle this case differently, but it currently prints `-1` directly without further checks.
  - Correct behavior: Since `p1 + p2 + p3 = 3` (odd), the correct output should be `-1`.

- **Test Case: `0 1 1`**
  - The sum is even, and `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should consider the possibility of one win and one draw, but it incorrectly prints `1`.
  - Correct behavior: One win and one draw (e.g., player 1 wins against player 2, and player 2 wins against player 3) would give the scores `0, 1, 1`. The correct output should be `1`.

- **Test Case: `1 1 2`**
  - The sum is even, and `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should consider the possibility of one win and one draw, but it incorrectly prints `2`.
  - Correct behavior: One win and one draw (e.g., player 1 wins against player 2, and player 1 wins against player 3) would give the scores `1, 1, 2`. The correct output should be `1`.

- **Test Case: `3 3 3`**
  - The sum is even, and `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should consider the possibility of three wins and three draws, but it incorrectly prints `-1`.
  - Correct behavior: Three wins and three draws (e.g., each player wins one game against the others) would give the scores `3, 3, 3`. The correct output should be `3`.

- **Test Case: `3 4 5`**
  - The sum is even, and `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should consider the possibility of two wins and four draws, but it incorrectly prints `6`.
  - Correct behavior: Two wins and four draws (e.g., player 3 wins against player 1 and player 2, and there are four draws among the three players) would give the scores `3, 4, 5`. The correct output should be `4`.

- **Test Case: `1 1 10`**
  - The sum is even, but `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should handle this case differently, but it currently prints `-1` directly without further checks.
  - Correct behavior: Since `p1 + p2 + p3 = 12` (even), but `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the correct output should be `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program has logical errors in handling the conditions and calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
