Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. It checks if the total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even for the given scoring rules (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total if it's a draw).
4. It then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If so, it prints `p1 + p2` because this scenario can only happen if there were no draws and the third player won all the games against the first and second players.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the lower and upper bounds for the number of draws. It then iterates to find the maximum number of draws that satisfy the conditions.
6. The code logic seems to handle the constraints and the problem requirements accurately.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
