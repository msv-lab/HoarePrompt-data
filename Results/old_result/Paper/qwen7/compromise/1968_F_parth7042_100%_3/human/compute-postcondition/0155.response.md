Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 7`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 3])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` has the value `['YES']`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending `'YES'`, its value becomes `['YES']`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
