Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    q = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = defaultdict(list)
    mp[0].append(0)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[index])
        r = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp[pf[r]]
        v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
        it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `q` times, and for each iteration, it appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list based on the conditions given, the final `results` list will have exactly `q` elements. Each element in `results` will be either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were met for that specific iteration.

The `data` list remains unchanged throughout the loop execution. The `index` variable will be `index + (2 * q)`, as the loop increments `index` by 2 in each iteration. The `l` and `r` variables will be set according to the current values of `data` at the positions determined by `index` during each iteration. The `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` variables will be calculated based on the current values of `pf` and `mp` dictionaries for each iteration. The `q` variable will be decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning the variable `q` has been exhausted. Therefore, `q` is now 0. The variable `index` has been incremented by a total of `2 * q` (since `index += 2` in each iteration). Given that the loop executed 3 times initially, `index` will have been incremented by 6 more times, making it `index + 6`.

The variable `results` contains a list of strings ('YES' or 'NO') corresponding to each iteration of the loop. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `results` will contain exactly `q` elements, which is the final value of `q` after the loop completes.

In summary, `q` is 0, `index` is `index + 6`, and `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' values corresponding to each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, `l` is the integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value from `data[index - 1]`, and `x` is calculated as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, the result for that iteration is 'YES'. Otherwise, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, and `it1` and `it2` are determined using binary search. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` hold, the result for that iteration is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. The loop continues until all `q` iterations are completed, and `index` is incremented by 2 for each iteration. The final state of `results` will be a list containing the outcome ('YES' or 'NO') for each of the `q` iterations.

The `data` list remains unchanged, and `index` will be `2 * q` larger than its initial value after all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
