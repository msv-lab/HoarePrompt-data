Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the same as before (`pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`), `v1` is the same as before (`mp[pf[r]]`), `v2` is the same as before (`mp[pf[l - 1]]`), `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), and `q` is `q - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `r`. Since `data[index + 1]` is converted to an integer using `int()`, `r` now holds the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
