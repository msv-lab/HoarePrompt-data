Output State: **`q` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 8`, and `n` is an integer value from `data[index - 6]`.**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` was set to `index + 6`, so after the increment, `index` becomes `index + 8`. The values of `q` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
