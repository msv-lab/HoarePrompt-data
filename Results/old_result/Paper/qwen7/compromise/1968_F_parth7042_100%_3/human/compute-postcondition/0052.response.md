Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the same as before (`mp[pf[r]]`), `v2` is the same as before (`mp[pf[l - 1]]`), `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), and `q` is `q - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `x` to be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
