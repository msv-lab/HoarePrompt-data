Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(data[index])` takes the value at the index `index` from the list `data` and converts it to an integer. This value is then assigned to the variable `l`. The initial states of `data` and `index` remain unchanged.
