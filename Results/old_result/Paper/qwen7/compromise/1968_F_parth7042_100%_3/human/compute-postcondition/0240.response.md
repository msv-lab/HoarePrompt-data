Based on the initial state provided, the `results` list contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, totaling `q` elements. When the `print` statement executes, it will join all elements of the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and print them out one by one.

Given this, the output will be:

Output: **results (where results is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line)**
