Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 5, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is int(data[index + 1]), `x` is pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1], `v1` is not yet defined, `v2` is not yet defined, `it1` is not yet defined, `it2` is not yet defined, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains 'YES' and we continue to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no further changes are made to the variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain as they were before the statement was executed.
