Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to `int(data[index])`, `index` is increased by 1 (so `index` is now `index_current + 2`), `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] XOR a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing `i` (where `i` is `i_current + 1`).**

This means that the `index` variable has been incremented by 1, making it `index_current + 2`. All other variables remain in their respective states as described in the initial state, with the updated value of `index`.
