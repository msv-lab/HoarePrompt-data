Output State: **`q` remains greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 4`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `mp[pf[l - 1]]` to `v2`. No other variables are affected. The values of `q`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `results`, `v1`, and the expressions they are derived from remain unchanged.
