Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `index` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `index` is still 2, and `t` is still an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.
