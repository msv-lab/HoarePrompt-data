Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]**.

This means that `v2` has been assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`. All other variables remain in their previously calculated states.
