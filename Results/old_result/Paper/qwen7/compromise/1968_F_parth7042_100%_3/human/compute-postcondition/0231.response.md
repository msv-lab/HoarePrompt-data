Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is now the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is updated to the value of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), `results` now contains 'YES', and `q` must be greater than 0; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `it1` to the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`. This function returns the index of the first occurrence in the list `v1` where the value `l` can be inserted without violating the order. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
