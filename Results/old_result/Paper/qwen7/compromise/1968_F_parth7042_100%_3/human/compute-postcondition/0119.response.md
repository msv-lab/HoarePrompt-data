Postcondition: `q` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect_left) - 1; `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and the value at `it1` in `v1` is less than the value at `it2` in `v2`.
