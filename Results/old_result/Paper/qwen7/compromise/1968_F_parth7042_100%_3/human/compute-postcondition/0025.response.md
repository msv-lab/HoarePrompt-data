Output State: **`a[1]` is updated to `int(data[index_current + 2])`, `index` is now `index_current + 3`, `pf[1]` is `pf[0] XOR a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing `i_current + 1` and appends `i_current + 1` to itself, `a[i] = int(data[index])` is executed, which updates `a[i]` to `int(data[index])`, `index` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was set to `index_current + 2`. After incrementing, `index` becomes `index_current + 3`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
