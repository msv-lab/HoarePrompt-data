Output State: **`i` is 4, `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `index` is increased by 1, `mp[pf[4]]` is a list containing 4**

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Since `i` is 4, `pf[i]` is `pf[4]`, which is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`. The `index` is increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified, so we only note that it has been increased. The list `mp[pf[4]]` now contains the value 4.
