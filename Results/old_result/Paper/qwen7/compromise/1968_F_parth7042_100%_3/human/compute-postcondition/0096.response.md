Output State: **`i` is 3, `pf[i]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `index` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `pf[i]` becomes `pf[2] ^ a[3]`. The other variables (`n` and `index`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
