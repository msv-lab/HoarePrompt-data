Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for the problem statement:

1. **Initialization of `k` and Array Processing**:
   - The initialization of `k` and the logic for updating `q1` and `q2` are incorrect. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the initial value of `k` and the indices for `q1` and `q2`.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the product of the array elements modulo `m`. It should start with the full product of the array and then update this product as elements are removed.
   - The program incorrectly updates `k` without starting with the full product of the array.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic for updating `k` and the indices `q1` and `q2` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the removal of elements and the calculation of the product modulo `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        
        # Calculate the initial product of the array modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        result = []
        for cmd in t:
            if cmd == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a.pop(0), -1, m)) % m
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a.pop(), -1, m)) % m
            result.append(product)
        
        print(*result)

func()
```

This corrected version initializes the product correctly, processes each command properly, and updates the product modulo `m` as elements are removed from the array.
