Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):`. The variables involved here are `i`, `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially `-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will start when `i` is in the range from `n-2` to `-1` (inclusive) and decrement `i` by `1` in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be within the range `n-2` to `-1`. Since `i` is currently `-1`, it is already in the correct range if `n >= 1`.
   - The value of `n` should be such that the loop can start. Therefore, `n` must be at least `1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be at least 1**
