Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `ii`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `ii` is less than the value obtained from `int(input())`.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 10^4\).
   - The array `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\) for all \(i\).
   - The string `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - The loop will start with `ii = 0` and will continue until `ii < int(input())`.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `ii` should be 0.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `t` is at least 1).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `ii` should be set to 0.
- `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1.

So, the final state is:
**`ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
