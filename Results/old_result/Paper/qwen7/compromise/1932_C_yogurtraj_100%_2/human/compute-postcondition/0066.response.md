Postcondition: `t` is an input integer from the new input, `ii` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is an input integer from the split input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string representation of `t`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` or `a[l] % m` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q1` is either `l - 2` or `l - 1` depending on the same condition, `q2` is either `l` or `l + 1` depending on the same condition, and `y` is adjusted accordingly.
