Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `ii` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is an input integer from the split input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string representation of `t`, `k` is updated based on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q1` and `q2` are adjusted accordingly, `y` is a list of `n` zeros, and `y[i]` is now equal to `k` for all indices `i` from `0` to `n-2`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `m`, but does not affect the values of `t`, `ii`, `a`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y`. The initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged except for the updates to `n` and `m`.
