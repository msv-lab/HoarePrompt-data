Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ii` must be an integer between 1 and t inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them based on whitespace, converting each to an integer. These values are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The values of `t` and `ii` remain unchanged from their initial state.
