Output State: **`i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`; `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`; `y[i]` is `k * a[q1] % m` if `t[i]` equals 'R', otherwise `y[i]` is `k * a[q1] % m`; `q1` is `q1 - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `q1` is decremented by 1, but the values of `i`, `k`, `y[i]`, and `t[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `q1` by 1.
