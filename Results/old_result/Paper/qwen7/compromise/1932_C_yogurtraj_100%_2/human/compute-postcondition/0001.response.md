Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ii` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the input value, the initial state must include the condition that the input value must be within the specified range.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- The array `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all i.
- The string `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

The key adjustment needed is ensuring that the input value for `ii` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ii` must be an integer between 1 and t inclusive**.

This ensures that the loop will execute for each test case as long as the input value is within the specified range.
