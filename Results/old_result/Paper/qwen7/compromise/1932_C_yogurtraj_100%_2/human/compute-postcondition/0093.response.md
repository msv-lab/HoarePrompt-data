Output State: **`i` is `n - 4` if it was `n - 3` before, or `n - 5` if it was `n - 4` before; `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`; `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`; if `t[i] == 'R'`, `q2` is increased by 1, otherwise `q1` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged from its previous state, `k` is updated based on the condition specified, `y[i]` is now equal to the current value of `k`, and `q2` or `q1` is adjusted according to the condition `t[i] == 'R'`.
