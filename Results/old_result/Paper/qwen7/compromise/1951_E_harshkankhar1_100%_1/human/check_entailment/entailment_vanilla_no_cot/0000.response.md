Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. While it works correctly, it's not used in the main logic of `func_2`.

2. **Main Logic (`func_2`)**:
   - **Case 1**: It correctly identifies if the entire string is a palindrome and prints "YES" with a single-partition if so.
   - **Case 2**: It attempts to split the string at the first non-matching character from the start. However, this approach is flawed because:
     - It only checks up to the first non-matching character, which may not guarantee a non-palindrome substring.
     - It doesn't handle cases where the string can be split into multiple non-palindromic parts.
   - **Case 3**: It incorrectly handles the middle of the string, especially when the length of the string is even. It should consider splitting the string into multiple parts, not just two.

3. **Examples**:
   - For the string "sinktheyacht", the program correctly identifies it as a single non-palindrome part.
   - For the string "lllllllll", the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it doesn't consider the possibility of splitting the string into smaller non-palindromic parts.
   - For the string "uwuowouwu", the program correctly identifies it as needing three parts, but the provided solution is incorrect ("uw uow ouwu" is not a valid partition).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def find_partition(s):
    n = len(s)
    if is_palindrome(s):
        return "NO"
    
    # Try to find a valid partition
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not is_palindrome(s[:i]):
            if not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
                return "YES", 2, [s[:i], s[i:]]
            elif i > 1 and not is_palindrome(s[i-1:n]):
                return "YES", 3, [s[:i-1], s[i-1:i], s[i:]]
    
    return "NO"

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        result, k, partition = find_partition(s)
        results.append((result, k, partition))
    
    for result, k, partition in results:
        print(result)
        if result == "YES":
            print(k)
            print(" ".join(partition))

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This approach ensures that the string is checked for palindromic properties and attempts to find a valid partition into non-palindromic substrings.
