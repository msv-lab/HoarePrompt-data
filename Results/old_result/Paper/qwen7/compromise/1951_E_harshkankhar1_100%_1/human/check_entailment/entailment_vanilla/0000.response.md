### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is equal to its reverse (`s[::-1]`), otherwise `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition.
     - Otherwise, it iterates through the string to find the first character that differs from the first character.
     - If no such character is found, it means the string is a palindrome, so it prints "NO".
     - If a differing character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the second part is a palindrome.
       - If the second part is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition.
       - If the second part is a palindrome and the split is at the beginning or middle of the string, it prints "NO".
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition.

### Analysis:

- The function correctly identifies if the entire string is a palindrome.
- When the entire string is not a palindrome, it correctly outputs "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
- When the entire string is a palindrome, it correctly outputs "NO".
- When the string can be split into two non-palindromic parts, it correctly outputs "YES" and the appropriate partitions.
- The logic handles edge cases like splitting at the beginning or middle of the string correctly.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_2` correctly implements the required logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs the correct results according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
