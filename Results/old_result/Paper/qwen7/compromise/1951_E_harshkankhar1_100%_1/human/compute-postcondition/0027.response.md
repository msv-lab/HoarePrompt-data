Postcondition: **s is an input string, n is the length of the input string s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and func_1(s[0:]) is True. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) evaluates to False, the function continues to ensure that func_1(s[0:]) is True and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True. If x is either 1 or half the length of s, the function checks that both func_1(s[0:]) and func_1(s[x + 1:]) are True. Otherwise, the function also ensures that both func_1(s[0:]) and func_1(s[x + 1:]) are True.**
