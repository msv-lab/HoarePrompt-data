Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if it's possible to choose exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of the two arrays \( a \) and \( b \) such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Key Steps in the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays \( a \) and \( b \), and the value of \( k \).
   - It then converts the arrays into sets to remove duplicates and filter out elements greater than \( k \).
   - It calculates the sets of elements exclusive to \( a \) (`only_a`), exclusive to \( b \) (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
   - It checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \). If so, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is at least \( k \). If not, it appends 'NO'.
   - If both checks pass, it appends 'YES'.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic for determining if it's possible to choose the required elements is sound. It correctly identifies if there are too many unique elements in either array or if the total count of unique elements is insufficient.
   - The conditions checked ensure that the chosen elements cover all integers from 1 to \( k \).

Based on the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
