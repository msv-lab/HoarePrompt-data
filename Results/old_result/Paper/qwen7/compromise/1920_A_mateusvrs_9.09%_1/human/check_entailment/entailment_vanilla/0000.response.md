### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function initializes `t` with the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of constraints.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store values of `x` where `a = 3` (i.e., `k` must not be equal to `x`).
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the bounds of `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `a = 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a = 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a = 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

3. **Validation and Calculation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there are no valid `k` values, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` within the range `[bx+1, ax-1]` from the total possible values `(ax - bx - 1)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly handles the constraints and ensures that only valid `k` values within the specified range are considered.
- The use of sets to store values of `x` for `a = 3` constraints helps in efficiently checking which values should be excluded.
- The calculation of the number of valid `k` values is accurate based on the constraints provided.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
