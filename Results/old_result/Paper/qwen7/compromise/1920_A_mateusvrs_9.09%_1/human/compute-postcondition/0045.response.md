Output State: **`cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is increased by 1.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `cx` and the range of `i` relative to `ax` and `bx` are not affected by this line of code, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `tmp` has been incremented by 1.
