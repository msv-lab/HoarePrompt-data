Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, `bx` remains the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` remains the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `cx` remains a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2; `r` is a list containing the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is incremented for each element in `cx` that falls within the range `[bx, ax]` if `bx >= ax`; otherwise, `r` contains the value 0.**
