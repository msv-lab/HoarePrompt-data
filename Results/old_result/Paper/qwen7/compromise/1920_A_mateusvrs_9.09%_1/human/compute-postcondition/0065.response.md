Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable here is `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state is given as follows:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ax` is 1000000007.
   - `bx` is -1.
   - `cx` is an empty set.
   - `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
   - `tmp` is increased by the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, and `tmp`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
