Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cx` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, in which case `tmp` is increased by 1.
- If `i` is not within the range `[bx, ax]`, the value of `tmp` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in cx:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `cx`.
   - Therefore, `i` will take on the values of the elements in `cx` one by one.

2. **Variable `tmp`:**
   - `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - If `i` is not within this range, `tmp` remains unchanged.

3. **Variable `cx`:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `cx`, `cx` itself does not change during the loop execution.

### Adjusting the States:
- We need to determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration.
- `cx` remains the same as it is being iterated over.
- `tmp` will either remain the same or increase by 1 depending on whether the new `i` falls within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Determining the New Value of `i`:
- Since `i` takes on the values of the elements in `cx` one by one, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `cx`.

### Conclusion:
- `cx` remains the same.
- `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` will either remain the same or increase by 1 based on whether the new `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Final State:
- `cx` must still contain at least one element (since it is being iterated over).
- `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` will either remain the same or increase by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is either the same or increased by 1**.
