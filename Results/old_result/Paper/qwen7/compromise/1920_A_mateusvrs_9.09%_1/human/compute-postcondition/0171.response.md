Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in cx`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `cx` (i.e., `cx` is not empty).

3. **Determine the postcondition**: After each iteration, `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`. Otherwise, `cx` and `tmp` remain unchanged.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cx` must have at least one element.
   - `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `cx` is not empty, `cx` must still have at least one element.
   - `tmp` will be increased by 1 if the current `i` (which is the next element in `cx`) is within the range `[bx, ax]`. If it is not, `tmp` remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `cx` must have at least one element.
- `tmp` will be increased by 1 if the next `i` (the first element in `cx`) is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `cx` must have at least one element, and `tmp` is increased by 1 if the first element in `cx` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.**
