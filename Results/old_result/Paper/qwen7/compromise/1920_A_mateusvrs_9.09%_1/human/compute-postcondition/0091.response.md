Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` equals 1, `ax` is now the minimum value between `x` and the previous value of `ax` if `a` equals 2, otherwise `x` is added to the set `cx`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `ax` to be the minimum value between `x` and the previous value of `ax` if `a` equals 2. For other values of `a`, the variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions and the value of `n` are still valid.
