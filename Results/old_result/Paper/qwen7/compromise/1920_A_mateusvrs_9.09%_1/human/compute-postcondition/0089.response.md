Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` equals 1, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax` if `a` equals 2, otherwise `x` is added to the set `cx`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

The code reads two integers, `a` and `x`, from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This updates the values of `a` and `x` but does not affect the other variables. The conditions for updating `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` will be evaluated later when the corresponding `if` statements are encountered. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
