Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax` if `a` equals 2, otherwise `x` is added to the set `cx`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. The other variables (`a`, `x`, `ax`, `cx`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
