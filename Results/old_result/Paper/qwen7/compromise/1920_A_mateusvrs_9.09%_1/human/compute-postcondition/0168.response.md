Output State: **`cx` must have at least one element; `tmp` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `cx` must have at least one element, its condition remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `tmp` and retains the precondition of `cx`.
