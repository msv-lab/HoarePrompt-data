Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax`. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx`, where `cx` is a set containing the element `x`.
