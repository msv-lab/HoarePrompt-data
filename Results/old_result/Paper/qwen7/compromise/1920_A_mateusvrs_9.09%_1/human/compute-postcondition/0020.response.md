Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(n)`. This means the loop variable `_` is incremented from 0 to `n-1` in each iteration. However, since the loop variable `_` is not used inside the loop, it does not affect the states of `n`, `a`, or `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body updates the state based on the value of `a`:
   - If `a == 1`, `x` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.
   - If `a == 2`, `x` is updated to the minimum of `x` and 2.
   - Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx`, and `a` is neither 1 nor 2.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop variable `_` is not used to modify `n`.
   - The values of `a` and `x` might change based on the conditions in the loop body.
   - Since `a` is neither 1 nor 2, it implies that `a` was not updated to 1 or 2 in the previous iteration, and thus `a` retains its original value (which is a positive integer).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n`, `a`, and `x`.

Since the loop runs for `n` iterations, and assuming the loop is about to start its next iteration, the value of `n` remains the same. The value of `a` remains the same unless explicitly changed within the loop, and `x` will be updated based on the condition in the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer**.
