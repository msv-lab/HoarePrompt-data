Postcondition: **`a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` equals 1, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and the previous value of `ax` if `a` equals 2, otherwise `x` is added to the set `cx`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block, indicating that regardless of whether `a` equals 2 or not, the values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are updated according to the specified rules, and `n` remains greater than 0.
