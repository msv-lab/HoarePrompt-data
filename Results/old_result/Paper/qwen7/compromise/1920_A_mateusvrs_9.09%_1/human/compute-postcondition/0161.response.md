Output State: **`bx` will be the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` will be the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `cx` will be a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`. `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `tmp` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `bx`, `ax`, or `cx`, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `tmp` is the only variable that has been updated.
