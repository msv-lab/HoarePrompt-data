Postcondition: **`n` will be 0, `a` will be an integer from the last input, `x` will be an integer from the last input, `bx` will be the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1 during the loop, `ax` will be the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2 during the loop, and `cx` will be a set containing all `x` where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 during the loop. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.**
