Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is the smaller of `x` and `a`.**

Explanation: The line `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum between `x` and `a`. Since `a` was assigned the first integer from the input and `x` was assigned the second integer from the input, `ax` now holds the smaller of these two values. The conditions and values of `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged except for the new value of `ax`.
