Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `cx`.

3. **Postcondition at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cx` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element in `cx`.
   - `tmp` is increased by 1.

4. **Loop Body Analysis**:
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` remains increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `tmp` remains increased by 1 as well (since there is no else part changing its value).

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `cx`, after the current iteration, `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `cx` still contains at least one element because it was stated that it must contain at least one element at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `tmp` remains increased by 1 regardless of the condition check.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `cx` still contains at least one element.
- `i` becomes the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` remains increased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1.**
