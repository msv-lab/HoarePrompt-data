Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even and non-negative. This logic is correct because:

- Each move can either add or remove one cube, meaning the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes in the tower changes with each move.
- To end up with \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves, the difference \( n - m \) must be even (since adding or removing one cube alternates the parity).

Additionally, the program correctly handles the constraints \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \) and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition.

Given this analysis, the program's logic aligns with the problem statement and the execution summary accurately describes its behavior.

Correctness: **True**
