Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the function `func_1()` incorrectly checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. This condition does not fully capture the requirements of the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the difference between the number of additions and removals of cubes results in exactly `m` cubes. Since each move adds or removes exactly one cube, the total number of additions must equal `m + k` and the total number of removals must equal `n - m - k` for some integer `k`. Therefore, the net effect should be `m` cubes, which means `n` must be at least `m` and the difference `(n - m)` must be even.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of moves `n` is sufficient to achieve `m` cubes and that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is necessary for the operations to balance out correctly.
