Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, so the difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative. However, the current implementation checks `(n - m) % 2 == 0` but does not ensure that `n >= m`.

For example, consider the test case:
- Input: `2 4`
- Expected Output: "No"
- Actual Output: "Yes"

This is because the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is satisfied, but `n` (2) is less than `m` (4), which is not possible since Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for this case.
