### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and then iterates over each test case using a loop. This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. This function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input. This part is also correct.

3. **Logic for Determining Validity**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Let's analyze the logic in detail:
- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes must remain consistent with the parity of the number of moves.
- **Condition `n - m >= 0`**: This condition ensures that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which makes sense because you cannot have more cubes removed than added.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic:
- The condition `n - m >= 0` is not strictly necessary. The problem statement specifies that each move either adds or removes exactly one cube, so the total number of cubes after `n` moves can never be negative. Therefore, the condition `n - m >= 0` is redundant and does not add any additional information or correctness to the solution.

To illustrate, consider the following examples:
- **Example 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` is `True`, and `3 - 3 >= 0` is `True`. The output is `Yes`.
- **Example 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `(2 - 4) % 2 == 0` is `False`. The output is `No`.

The logic works correctly in these examples, but the condition `n - m >= 0` is not needed. Removing this condition does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description. The condition `n - m >= 0` is redundant but does not impact the overall correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
**True**
