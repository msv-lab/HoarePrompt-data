### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description and Constraints**:
   - The problem states that Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - After \( n \) moves, the resulting tower should have exactly \( m \) cubes.
   - The difference between \( n \) and \( m \) must be even and non-negative.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks if \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( n - m \geq 0 \).
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Annotated Code Explanation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the conditions under which the program outputs "Yes" or "No".
   - The key point is that the program ensures the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even and non-negative, which aligns with the problem constraints.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment claims the program incorrectly handles the case where \( n < m \).
   - However, the annotated code and the program logic clearly show that the condition \( n - m \geq 0 \) ensures \( n \geq m \).

5. **Test Case Verification**:
   - For the test case `2 4`:
     - \( n = 2 \)
     - \( m = 4 \)
     - \( n - m = 2 - 4 = -2 \)
     - Since \( n - m < 0 \), the condition \( n - m \geq 0 \) fails, and the program correctly outputs "No".

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.
   - The original assessment is inaccurate because it incorrectly identified a flaw that does not exist in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
