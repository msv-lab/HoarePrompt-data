Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `a` is a list where every second element starting from index 0 is reversed.
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a`. Since the exact elements of `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the precise content of the list. However, we know that every second element starting from index 0 is reversed.

To illustrate with an example, if `a` was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then after reversing every second element starting from index 0, it would become `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`.

Given the general nature of the list `a` and the transformation applied to it, the output will be the list `a` with every second element starting from index 0 reversed.

Output: **[reversed second elements of the list a]**
