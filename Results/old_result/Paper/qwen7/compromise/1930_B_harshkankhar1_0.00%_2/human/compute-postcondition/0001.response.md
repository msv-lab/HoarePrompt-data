Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` is a list where every second element starting from index 0 is reversed, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element in the list `a`, starting from the first element (index 0). This means that the elements at even indices in the list `a` are reversed. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` also remains unchanged.
