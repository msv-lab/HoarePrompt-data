The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^3 \)) and an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)). For each test case, it creates a list of integers from 1 to \( t \), reverses every second element in the list, and prints the modified list. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list for each test case.
