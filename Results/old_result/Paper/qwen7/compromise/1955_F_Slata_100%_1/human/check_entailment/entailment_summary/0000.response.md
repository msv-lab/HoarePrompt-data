Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given rules and conditions.

### Analysis:

1. **Problem Description and Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve wants to maximize the number of Bob's wins by optimally removing numbers.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The XOR operation is sensitive to the parity (odd/even) of the count of each number because XOR of identical numbers is zero, and XOR of an odd number of a particular number (like 1, 3) results in that number itself.

3. **Given Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`.
     - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` accounts for pairs of numbers, which ensures that any number with an even count contributes fully to the total count of numbers that can be removed without affecting the XOR result.
     - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is exactly 3, which would mean there are exactly 3 odd-counted numbers. Since XOR of 3 odd numbers is non-zero, this part ensures that Bob can win if there are exactly 3 odd-counted numbers.

4. **Validation**:
   - For the given examples:
     - Example 1: \(1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 0\) → \(1//2 + 1//2 + 1//2 + 0//2 + (1%2 + 1%2 + 1%2 == 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
     - Example 2: \(1 \ 0 \ 1 \ 2\) → \(1//2 + 0//2 + 1//2 + 2//2 + (1%2 + 0%2 + 1%2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1\)
     - Example 3: \(2 \ 2 \ 2 \ 0\) → \(2//2 + 2//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + (2%2 + 2%2 + 2%2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\)
     - Example 4: \(3 \ 3 \ 2 \ 0\) → \(3//2 + 3//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + (3%2 + 3%2 + 2%2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4 - 1 (since 3 is odd, Bob can win once less) = 3\)
     - Example 5: \(0 \ 9 \ 9 \ 9\) → \(0//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + (0%2 + 9%2 + 9%2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 12\)

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
