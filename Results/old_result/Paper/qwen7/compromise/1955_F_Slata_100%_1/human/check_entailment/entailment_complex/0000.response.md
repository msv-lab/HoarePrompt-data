Reasoning:
The given program attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice based on the provided rules. However, the logic implemented in the function does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by optimally removing numbers.

2. **Given Solution**:
   - The function calculates the sum of the quotients when each of the four counts (a, b, c, d) is divided by 2 and adds 1 if the sum of the remainders of these divisions is exactly 3.
   - This logic does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize Bob's wins by strategically removing numbers to ensure the final XOR is zero.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, we need to ensure that the final sequence has a bitwise XOR of zero. This means we should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers' XOR is zero.
   - The optimal strategy involves removing numbers that contribute to making the XOR non-zero. Specifically, we should focus on the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s because the XOR operation depends on the parity of the counts.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - Count the total number of 1s, 3s (since 1 XOR 3 = 2 and 3 XOR 3 = 0).
   - The number of times Bob can win is equal to the minimum of the counts of 1s and 3s, as each pair (1, 3) can be removed to maintain the XOR as zero.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required logic.

Correctness: **False**
