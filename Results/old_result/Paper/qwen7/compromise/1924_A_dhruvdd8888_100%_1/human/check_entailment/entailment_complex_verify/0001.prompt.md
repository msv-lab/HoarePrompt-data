You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). It checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) distinct characters from the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets. If any test case meets this criterion, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it determines which character from the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets is missing and prints a string consisting of the characters in the list \( ans \) followed by the missing character and the remaining characters needed to satisfy the count \( n \). If none of the test cases meet the criterion, the function prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is an error because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.
   - The function should handle the logic to check subsequences and generate the output.

3. **Logic for Checking Subsequences:**
   - The program attempts to find a sequence of characters in `s` that matches the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It uses a set `us` to store the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if characters in `s` match those in `us`. When a match is found, it adds the character to the set `win`.
   - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the character to `ans` and clears `win` to start checking again.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `ps` (number of times `win` was fully matched) is at least `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and generates a string of length `n` using characters from `us` that were not found in `win`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Function Call Missing:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called in the main loop. This means the program will not process any test cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Generating Output:**
   - The logic to generate a string of length `n` using characters from `us` that were not found in `win` is flawed. It simply appends one of the missing characters and 'a' characters, which does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid subsequence of `s`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix these issues, we need to:
1. Call the function `func_1()` inside the main loop.
2. Ensure the logic for generating the output string is correct.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Generate a string of length n using characters from us that were not found in win
        missing_chars = [c for c in us if c not in win]
        if missing_chars:
            ans.append(missing_chars[0])
        while len(ans) < n:
            ans.append('a')
        print(''.join(ans))
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical errors and missing function calls, which prevent it from correctly solving the problem as specified. The corrected version addresses these issues and should now work as intended.
