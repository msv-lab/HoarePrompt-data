Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, `win` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `win`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
