Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 26\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 26\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.
- `win` is a set containing the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are in `us`.
- `ans` is a list containing the last character added to `win` for each group of `k` unique characters from `s` that are in `us`.
- `ps` is an integer less than `n` equal to the number of times `win` was cleared.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any dependence on the values of the other variables or objects. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
