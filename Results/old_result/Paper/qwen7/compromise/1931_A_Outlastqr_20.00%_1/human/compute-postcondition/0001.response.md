Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a non-negative integer value. However, since the loop head only involves `i`, the condition for the loop to execute is based on the value of `i` after each iteration.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `t` and `n` are not directly involved in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The loop will start with `i` being 0 (since `range(int(input()))` starts from 0) and will increment `i` by 1 with each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must provide a value greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i` and the condition for `int(input())` to provide a valid input.

**State:**
- `i` must be 0 initially.
- `int(input())` must provide a value greater than or equal to 1.

Putting this together, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must provide a value greater than or equal to 1**
