Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, alphabet is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.**

The code initializes the variable `alphabet` with all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
