Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `r` is a string consisting of unique characters from `encoded` sorted in ascending order; `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a character from `r` and its corresponding value is the character from `r` at the mirrored index (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second character maps to the second last, and so on).**

This output state describes that the `mapping` dictionary has been created based on the string `r`. Each character in `r` is mapped to another character in `r` such that the mapping is symmetric around the center of `r`. The lengths and conditions of `encoded` and `r` remain unchanged.
