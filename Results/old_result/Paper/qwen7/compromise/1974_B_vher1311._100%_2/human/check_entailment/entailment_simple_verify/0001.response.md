### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings. It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`), the length of each encoded string (`n`), and the encoded strings themselves. This part is correct.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the encoded string `b`. This part is correct.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Creating String `r`**: The function `func_1` creates the string `r` by sorting and removing duplicates from the encoded string `b`. This part is correct.
   - **Mapping Characters**: It then creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`. This is done correctly.
   - **Decoding**: Finally, it decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`. However, there is a critical flaw in this step. The mapping should be such that the first character in `r` maps to the last character in `r`, the second character in `r` maps to the second-to-last character in `r`, and so on. The current implementation uses a dictionary comprehension `{r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}`, which is incorrect because it maps characters in `r` to their symmetric positions in reverse order, but it should map them to their symmetric positions in the original sorted order.

To illustrate, consider the example `encoded = "serofedsoc"`:
- `r = 'cdefors'`
- The correct mapping should be:
  - 'c' -> 's'
  - 'd' -> 'r'
  - 'e' -> 'e'
  - 'f' -> 'd'
  - 'o' -> 'o'
  - 'r' -> 'c'

However, the current implementation would incorrectly map:
- 'c' -> 's'
- 'd' -> 'r'
- 'e' -> 'd'
- 'f' -> 'c'
- 'o' -> 'o'
- 'r' -> 's'

This results in the incorrect decoded string "scrodefedsoc" instead of "codeforces".

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly create the mapping for the decoding process. The current implementation of the mapping is flawed and does not produce the correct decoded string.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
