Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - This part is correct and necessary for determining the optimal strategy.

3. **Finding the Minimum Excludant (MEX)**:
   - The function `func_1()` aims to find the MEX of the array `c` formed during the game.
   - It initializes a counter `t` to keep track of how many unique elements have been seen so far.
   - It iterates through the range `[0, N+1)` to check for the smallest missing non-negative integer.
   - If an element `i` appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if `cnt[i]` becomes 0, it returns `i`.

### Issues and Correctness

1. **Logic for Finding MEX**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` is flawed. It does not simulate the game's turns correctly.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a`, append it to `c`, and then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it without appending to `c`.
   - The current implementation does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice picking elements such that Bob is forced to pick elements that minimize the MEX.
   - The current implementation does not simulate these turns and directly computes the MEX without considering the game's turns.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game's turns and therefore does not solve the problem as described. The logic for finding the MEX is also incorrect because it does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: **False**
