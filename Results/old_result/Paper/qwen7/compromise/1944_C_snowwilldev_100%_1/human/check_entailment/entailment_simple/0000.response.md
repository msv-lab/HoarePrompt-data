Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and the calculation of the MEX. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Game Logic**: 
   - Alice and Bob have different rules for picking elements. Alice can pick any element from the array `a`, append it to `c`, and remove it from `a`. Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it. However, the current implementation does not simulate these turns correctly.
   - The program simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and then tries to determine the MEX based on the counts, which does not reflect the actual game process.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating up to `N+1` and checking the count of each number. This approach does not consider the sequence of moves made by Alice and Bob during the game. It assumes that the MEX can be determined solely by the counts of numbers, which is not accurate.

3. **Missing Simulation of Turns**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the initial counts of numbers, which does not account for the strategic nature of the game where players try to influence the MEX.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the game logic and will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
