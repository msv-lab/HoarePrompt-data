Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `success` is `False`
- `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all monsters
- `bullets_needed` is the last `health` value
- `position` is `monsters[n-1][0]`
- `health` is `monsters[n-1][1]`
- `distance` is `abs(position)`
- `time_available` is `distance`

The print statement is:

```python
print('YES' if success else 'NO')
```

Given that `success` is `False`, the expression `'YES' if success else 'NO'` evaluates to `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
