Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list named `healths` by taking input as a string, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
