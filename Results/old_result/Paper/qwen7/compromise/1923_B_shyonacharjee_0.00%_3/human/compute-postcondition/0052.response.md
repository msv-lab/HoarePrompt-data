Output State: **`success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `i` is `n-2`, `bullets_needed` is `health` for the last monster in the list, `position` is the position of the current monster, `health` is the health of the current monster, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.**

Explanation: The line `time_available = distance` simply assigns the value of `distance` to `time_available`. No other variables are affected. The precondition remains unchanged, and the value of `time_available` is now explicitly stated as being equal to `distance`.
