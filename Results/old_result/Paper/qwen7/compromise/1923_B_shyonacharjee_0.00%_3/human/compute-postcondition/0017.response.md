Postcondition: `i` is 0, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is its original value, `health` is its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, and `success` is False. This is because either the total bullets used plus the needed bullets exceed the available time, in which case we break out of the loop or if statement with `success` set to False, or there is no else part, so the same conditions apply.
