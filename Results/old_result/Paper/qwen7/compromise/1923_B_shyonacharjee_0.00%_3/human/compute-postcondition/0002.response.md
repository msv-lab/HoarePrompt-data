Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition of being greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3⋅10^4.
