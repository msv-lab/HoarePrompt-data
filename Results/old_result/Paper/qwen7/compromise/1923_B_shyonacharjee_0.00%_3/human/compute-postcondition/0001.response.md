State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3â‹…10^4**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` from the expression `range(t)`.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` requires a non-negative integer as its argument.
- Additionally, since `t` is constrained by the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), this constraint must be maintained.
- The initial state of `t` being an integer within this range ensures that the loop can execute as intended.
