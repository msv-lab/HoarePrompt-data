Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `q` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the input does not affect its value. Therefore, `t` still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 1000, and `q` now holds the integer input provided by the user.
