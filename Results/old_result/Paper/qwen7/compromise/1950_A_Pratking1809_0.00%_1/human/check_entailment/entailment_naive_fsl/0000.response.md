Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b` is equal to either `a` or `c`. According to the problem description, for the digits to form a stair, `a < b < c`, and for them to form a peak, `a < b > c`. However, the program does not check for equality conditions, which leads to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input `1 5 3`. Based on the problem description, this should be classified as a "PEAK" because `1 < 5 > 3`. However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify it as "NONE" because it does not account for the case where `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.
