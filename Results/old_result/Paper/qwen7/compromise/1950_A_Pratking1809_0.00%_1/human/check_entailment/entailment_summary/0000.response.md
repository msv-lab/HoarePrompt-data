Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking the conditions for a stair and a peak. However, there is a logical issue with how the conditions are checked. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the conditions for a stair and a peak within the loop. Here's why:

1. The program initializes `mn` to 100, which is unnecessary for this problem.
2. The program uses separate `if` statements for checking the conditions, but it does not ensure that only one condition is checked per test case. This means that if both conditions are met (which is impossible since they are mutually exclusive), it will print both 'STAIR' and 'PEAK'.
3. The program should only check one condition per test case and print the appropriate result.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not properly handle the conditions and could produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
