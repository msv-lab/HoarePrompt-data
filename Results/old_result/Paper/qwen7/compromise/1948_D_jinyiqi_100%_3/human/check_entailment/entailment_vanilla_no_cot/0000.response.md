Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Call in the Loop**: The function `func_1()` is called within the loop, but it should be called once per input string, not repeatedly.
2. **Count Logic**: The logic for counting matching characters is flawed. It increments `count` whenever there is a match or a `?`, which does not ensure that the entire substring is checked for being a tandem repeat.
3. **Termination Condition**: The program should check for the longest possible tandem repeat and print it, but the current implementation may terminate early if it finds a valid tandem repeat of length `j`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j + 1):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?':
                continue
            if s[k] != s[k + j]:
                break
            count += 1
        else:
            max_length = max(max_length, count * 2)
    
    # Handle case where no tandem repeat is found
    if max_length == 0:
        max_length = 0
    else:
        max_length = max(max_length, 2 * (n // 2))
    
    print(max_length)
```

This corrected program:
- Iterates through possible lengths of tandem repeats from the longest to the shortest.
- Checks each possible substring of that length to see if it forms a tandem repeat.
- Uses a `continue` statement to skip over substrings containing `?`.
- Ensures the entire substring is checked before updating the maximum length.
- Handles the case where no tandem repeat is found.
