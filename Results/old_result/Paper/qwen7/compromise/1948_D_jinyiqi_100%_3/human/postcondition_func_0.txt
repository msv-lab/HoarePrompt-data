The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for pairs of characters that are either equal or both question marks, starting from the middle of the string and moving towards the beginning. If it finds such a pair, it prints twice the length of the longest such sequence found and exits. If no such sequence is found, it prints 0. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
