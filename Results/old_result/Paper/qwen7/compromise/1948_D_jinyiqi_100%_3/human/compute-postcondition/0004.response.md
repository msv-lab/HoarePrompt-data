Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `k`, `n`, and `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `k` in the range `0` to `n - j`. This means `k` will take values from `0` to `n - j - 1`.

3. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - `k` starts at `0`.
   - `n` must be at least 2 (as given in the problem statement).
   - `j` is set to `n // 2`, meaning `j` is half of `n` (integer division).

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n - j` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - Given `j = n // 2`, the condition `n - j ≥ 0` simplifies to `n - (n // 2) ≥ 0`, which is always true for `n ≥ 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `count` is not relevant to the loop head and can remain as `0`.
   - `t` is not relevant to the loop head and can remain as an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `s` is not relevant to the loop head and can remain as a list of characters.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `j` is set to `n // 2`, so `j` must be an integer.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is set to `n // 2`**
