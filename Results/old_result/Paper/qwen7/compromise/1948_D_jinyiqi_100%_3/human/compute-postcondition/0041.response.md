Output State: **`count` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is 0, `s[k]` is not equal to `'?'`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `'?'`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`**

Explanation: The line `count = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `count`. None of the other variables (`j`, `n`, `k`, `s[k]`, `s[k + j]`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
