Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks; `n` is the length of the list `s`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `count` is either less than `j` or has reached a value where `count == j` triggers the print statement and the function returns.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `count` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is 2, and the loop has completed all its iterations.

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop continues to increment `k` from 0 up to `n - j - 1`. The value of `count` resets to 0 each time through the loop unless specific conditions are met (which did not happen in the first three iterations). Since `count` was not incremented to match `j` within these iterations, it remains 0 after all iterations. The variable `j` and `n` do not change inside the loop, so they retain their initial values. The variable `k` increments by 1 with each iteration, so after the loop completes, `k` will be equal to `n - j - 1`, which is 2 in this case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations without `count` ever reaching the value of `j`. Therefore, the function does not return any value, and the final state of `count` remains unchanged from its last value before the loop exited.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `count` retains its value from the last iteration, which did not reach the value of `j`. Since `count` never reached `j`, the function did not return any value during the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
