Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. The values of `n` and `m` are dependent on the user's input, so they are described as input integers.
