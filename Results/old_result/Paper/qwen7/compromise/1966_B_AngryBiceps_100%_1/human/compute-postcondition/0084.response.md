Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input from the user.
- `first_row` is the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`.
- `last_row` is the sum of the last elements of all sublists in `a`.

The additional conditions are:
- The first row (`a[0]`) and the last row (`a[-1]`) are not entirely the same, or at least one of them contains more than one unique element.
- Each of the first row and the last row contains exactly one unique element.
- These two unique elements are different.

Given this information, the print statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
