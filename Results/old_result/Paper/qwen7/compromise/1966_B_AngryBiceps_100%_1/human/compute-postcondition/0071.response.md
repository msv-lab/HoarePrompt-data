Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the last element of the original input and the first element of the new input.**

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding the first element of the last sublist in the list `a` to `first_row`. Since `a` contains two elements, the last sublist is `a[-1]`, and its first element is `a[-1][0]`. Therefore, `first_row` is updated to be the sum of `first_row` and `a[-1][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
