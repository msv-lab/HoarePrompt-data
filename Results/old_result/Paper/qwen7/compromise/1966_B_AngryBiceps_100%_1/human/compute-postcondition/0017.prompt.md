Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `first_row` and the second element is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to `first_row + a[-1][0]`, `last_row` is equal to the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is `first_row + a[-1][0]`, the second element is the input from the user, and the third element is the input from the user, `last_row` is equal to the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]` plus `a[-1][-1]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
