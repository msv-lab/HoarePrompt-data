Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.**

The code assigns an empty string to the variable `last_row`. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
