Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is a valid integer.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input received during the corresponding iteration of the loop.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`, and each character appears twice in `last_row`.
- The first character of the first string in `a` is not the same as the last character of the last string in `a`.
- At least one of the first or last strings in `a` contains more than one unique character.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, the length of the set of characters in `last_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string "YES" regardless of the values of the other variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
