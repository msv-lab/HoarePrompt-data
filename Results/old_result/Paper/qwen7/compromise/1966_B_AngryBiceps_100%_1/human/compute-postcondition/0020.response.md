Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is a valid integer.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input received during the corresponding iteration of the loop.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`, and each character appears twice.
- The length of the set of the first character of the first element in `a` is 1, meaning the first character of the first element in `a` is unique.
- The length of the set of the last character of the last element in `a` is 1, meaning the last character of the last element in `a` is unique.
- The first and last elements in `a` are not the same.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
