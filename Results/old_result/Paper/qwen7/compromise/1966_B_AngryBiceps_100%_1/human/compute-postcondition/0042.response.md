Output State: **`last_row` is now the concatenation of its original value and the last character of the newly added element in the list `a`; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list containing one more element than before, which is the input from the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the original element and the first character of the new element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the newly added element in the list `a` to the current value of `last_row`. All other variables remain unchanged.
