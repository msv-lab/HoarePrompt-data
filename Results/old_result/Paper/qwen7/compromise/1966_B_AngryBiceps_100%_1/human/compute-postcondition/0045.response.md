Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the integer `n`, `first_row` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` increments `first_row` by the first (and only) element of the list `a`, which is `n`. Since `a` is a list containing one element which is the input integer `n`, `a[-1][0]` refers to `n`. The initial value of `first_row` is not specified, but after executing the code, `first_row` is set to `n`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` remains a list containing the integer `n`.
