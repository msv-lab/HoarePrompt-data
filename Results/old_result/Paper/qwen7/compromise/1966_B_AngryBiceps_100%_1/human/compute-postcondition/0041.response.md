Output State: **`last_row` is now the last character of the only element in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing one more element than before, which is the input from the user, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the original element and the first character of the new element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element added to the list `a` to `first_row`. Since `a[-1]` refers to the last element in the list (which is the newly added user input), and `[0]` accesses its first character, `first_row` is updated to include this new character. All other variables remain unchanged.
