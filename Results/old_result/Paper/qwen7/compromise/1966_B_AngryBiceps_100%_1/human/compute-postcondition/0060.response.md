Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations, and `_`, which is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the input integer. This means that the loop has just completed its final iteration.

3. **Determine the New State**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since the loop has just completed its final iteration with `i = n-1`, the next input must be an integer greater than 0 to allow the loop to run again.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop can run again if the input is greater than 0.

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
- The loop will run again if the input is greater than 0.
- The input integer `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
- The variable `i` will be set to 0 for the new iteration since it starts from 0 in each new iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 0 (since the loop starts from 0 in each new iteration).
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
