Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
