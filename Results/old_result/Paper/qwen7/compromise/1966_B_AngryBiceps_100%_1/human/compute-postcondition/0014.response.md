Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is `first_row`, the second element is the input from the user, and the third element is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to `first_row + a[-1][0]`, `last_row` is equal to the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two elements: the first element is `first_row` and the second element is the input from the user. After appending the input from the user again, `a` now contains three elements. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the relationship between `first_row` and the elements of `a` is maintained. The value of `n` remains unchanged as well.
