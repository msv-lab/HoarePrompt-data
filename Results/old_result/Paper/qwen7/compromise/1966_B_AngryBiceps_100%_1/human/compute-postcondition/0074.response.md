Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user
   - `first_row` is the sum of the last element of the original input and the first element of the new input
   - `last_row` is increased by the last element of the new input

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - The states of `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the last element of the original input and the first element of the new input, `last_row` is increased by the last element of the new input**
