Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` adds the first element of the only element in the list `a` to `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one element (which is a list), `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `[0]` accesses its first element. The value of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
