Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program checks only the first and last rows and columns for uniformity and makes a decision based on that. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not account for all possible configurations of the grid.

For instance, consider the following grid:
```
BWBW
BWBW
```

According to the problem description, it is possible to make all squares the same color using the given operations. However, the program would incorrectly output "NO" because the first and last rows and columns are not uniform.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check every row and column to ensure they can all be made uniform through the allowed operations. The current implementation fails to handle such cases.
