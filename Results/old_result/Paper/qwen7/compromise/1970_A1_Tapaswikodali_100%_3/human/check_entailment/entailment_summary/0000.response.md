Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to implement a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. We have two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 
   - `func_1` compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance values and positions.
   - `func_2` processes the input string, calculates the balance information for each character, sorts the balance information based on the specified criteria, and constructs the shuffled sequence.
3. Let's analyze `func_2`:
   - It correctly initializes the balance and iterates through the string to create `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - These objects are stored in a list `balance_info`, which is then sorted using the key provided by `func_1`. This ensures that the sorting is done first by balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order within the same balance.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.
4. Given the problem statement and the execution summary of `func_2`, it appears that `func_2` correctly implements the required logic for the balanced shuffle operation.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the analysis of the code, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
