Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, the `BalanceInfo` class is not defined in the given code snippet, and the `func_1` function is not used in the `func_2` function. Additionally, the sorting key should prioritize non-negative balances to ensure that the sequence remains balanced throughout the shuffle process.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character

def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)

# Example usage
s = "(()(()))"
func_2(s)
```

This corrected version defines the `BalanceInfo` class and uses it to store the necessary information for each character in the string. It then sorts the list of `BalanceInfo` objects based on the specified criteria and constructs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.
