### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to implement the "balanced shuffle" operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. This involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting based on the balance and position, and then constructing the resulting sequence.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   - If the balances are different, it returns the difference in balance.
   - If the balances are the same, it returns the difference in position.
   - This function is used as the key for sorting in `func_2`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It computes the balance for each character in the string.
   - It sorts the list of `BalanceInfo` objects using the custom comparison function `func_1`.
   - It constructs the final result by concatenating the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - The result is printed.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the sorting criteria.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly computes the balance for each prefix and sorts the `BalanceInfo` objects accordingly.
   - The construction of the result string from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects is done correctly.

Given the detailed implementation and the logical steps involved, the provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
