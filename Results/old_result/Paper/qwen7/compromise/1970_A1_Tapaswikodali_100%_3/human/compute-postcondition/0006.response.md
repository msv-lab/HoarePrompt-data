Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects sorted by balance value in ascending order and by position in descending order for objects with the same balance value; `balance` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `balance_info` list based on two criteria: first by the `balance` value in ascending order, and second by the `position` in descending order for those with the same `balance` value. The length of the string `s` (`n`) and the initial `balance` value remain unchanged.
