The function accepts two parameters, infoA and infoB, which are objects with attributes `balance` (an integer) and `position` (an integer). It returns the difference between the `balance` attribute of `infoA` and the `balance` attribute of `infoB` if their balances are not equal. If their balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` attribute of `infoB` and the `position` attribute of `infoA`.
