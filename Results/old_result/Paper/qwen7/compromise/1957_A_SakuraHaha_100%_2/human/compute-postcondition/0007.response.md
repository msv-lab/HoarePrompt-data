Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which is iterating over `cnt.values()`. This means `x` will take on the values of the dictionary `cnt`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the dictionary `cnt` must contain at least one value. If `cnt` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **List the relevant states**: The relevant states to consider are `ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `ans` is given as 0, so no adjustment is needed for `ans`.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, so no adjustment is needed for `t`.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, so no adjustment is needed for `a`.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must have at least one value.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt` to ensure it has at least one value.

**State:**
**`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` must have at least one value**
