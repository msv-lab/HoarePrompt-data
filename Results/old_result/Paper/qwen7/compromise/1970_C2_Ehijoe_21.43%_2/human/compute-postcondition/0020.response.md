Postcondition: `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an input integer, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key in the range [1, n] having a value that is a list containing its adjacent keys from the input, and `leaves` is a deque containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have only one adjacent key. There either exists at least one move in `moves` that is odd, or all moves in `moves` are even numbers.
