Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, where each tuple (u, v) indicates an edge between nodes u and v, and `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the starting node for the first round, `n` is updated to the integer input, and `t` is updated to the integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. The values of `edges` and `start` remain unchanged. The new values of `n` and `t` are set to the integers provided as input.
