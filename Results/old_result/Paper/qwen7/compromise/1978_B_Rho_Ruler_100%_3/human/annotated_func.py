#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns the expression `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` evaluated with the given values of `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates and returns the value of the expression `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` based on these inputs. The expression represents a computation involving the integers `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `k` is constrained by `0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)`, `n` is the total number of buns, `a` is the usual price of a bun, and `b` is the price of the first bun sold at a modified price.
