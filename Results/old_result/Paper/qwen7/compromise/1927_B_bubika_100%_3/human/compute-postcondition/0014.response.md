Output State: **`r` is increased by `a[x]`, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, and `r` is now `r + a[x] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increases the value of `b[x]` by 1. Since `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, the value of `b[x]` is now one more than its previous value. The other variables (`r`, `x`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `r` is still increased by `a[x]`, `x` is still the index of `i` in `b`, `b[x]` is now increased by 1 compared to its previous value, `x` is still the index of `i` in `b`, and `r` is now `r + a[x] + 1`.
