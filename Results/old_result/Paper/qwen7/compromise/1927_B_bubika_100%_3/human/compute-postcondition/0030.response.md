Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `r` is `a[x]` added to its previous value.
   - `i` is the first character of the string `s`.
   - `x` is the index of `i` in the string `b`.
   - `b[x]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be a valid character in the string `s`. Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, `i` will be the next character in `s` after the previous iteration.
   - The variable `x` will be updated to the index of the new `i` in the string `b`.
   - `b[x]` will be incremented by 1 again for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `r` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `x` will be the index of the new `i` in the string `b`.
   - `b[x]` will be incremented by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`r` is `a[x]` added to its previous value, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the string `b`, and `b[x]` is incremented by 1**.
