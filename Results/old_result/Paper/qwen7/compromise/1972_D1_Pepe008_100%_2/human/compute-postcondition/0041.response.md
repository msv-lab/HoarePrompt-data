Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The code initializes `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `i` is initially set to 1, the expression simplifies to `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `a // 1 + 1`, resulting in `a + 1`. However, since `i` is only defined as 1 here, the exact value of `x` depends on the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
