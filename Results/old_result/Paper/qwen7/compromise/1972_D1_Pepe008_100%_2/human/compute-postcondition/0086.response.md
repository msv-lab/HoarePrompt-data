Postcondition: `t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 1`, `x` is `(int(info[0]) - int(info[1]) * (int(info[1]) - 1)) // (int(info[1]) - 1)`, `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus 1, and the current value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is divisible by `i`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains 2, `a` and `b` retain their original values, `i` is incremented by 1 from `int(info[1])`, `x` is recalculated as `(int(info[0]) - int(info[1]) * (int(info[1]) - 1)) // (int(info[1]) - 1)`, and `suma` is incremented by 1 if the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is greater than 0. If the condition is not met, the values remain unchanged except for `i` being incremented.
