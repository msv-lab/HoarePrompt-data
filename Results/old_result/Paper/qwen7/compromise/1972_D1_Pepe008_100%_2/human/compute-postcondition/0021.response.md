Postcondition: `t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma` + 1, `x` is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true, then `x` is updated to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i. Since there is no else part, the conditions and updates specified in the if part are the final state of the variables.
