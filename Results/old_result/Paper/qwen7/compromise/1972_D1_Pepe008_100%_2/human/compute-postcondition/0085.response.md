Postcondition: `t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 1`, `x` is `(int(info[0]) - int(info[1]) * (int(info[1]) - 1)) // (int(info[1]) - 1)`, `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus 1, and the current value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is divisible by `i`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, the variable `t` remains 2, `a` remains `int(info[0])`, `b` remains at least 1, `i` remains `int(info[1]) + 1`, and `x` remains `(int(info[0]) - int(info[1]) * (int(info[1]) - 1)) // (int(info[1]) - 1)`. Additionally, `suma` is incremented by 1, and the expression `a - i * (i - 1)` is divisible by `i`.
