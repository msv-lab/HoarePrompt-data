Postcondition: `t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 1`, `x` is `(int(info[0]) - int(info[1]) * (int(info[1]) - 1)) // (int(info[1]) - 1)`, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value, and the current value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is divisible by `i ** 2` and `i * (i - 1)` is also divisible by `i ** 2`.
