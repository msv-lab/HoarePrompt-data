Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 2)) // (k + 2) + 1`, `suma` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The original value of `i` was `k + 2`. The code updates `x` to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Substituting `i` with `k + 2`, we get `x` as `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 1)) // (k + 2) ** 2 + 1`. However, the original value of `x` was `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 2)) // (k + 2)`. Simplifying the new expression, we see that `x` is updated to the original value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
