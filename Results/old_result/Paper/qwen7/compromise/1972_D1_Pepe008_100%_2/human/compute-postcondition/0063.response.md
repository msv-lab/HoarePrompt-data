Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 2)) // (k + 2) + 1`, `suma` is `suma` + 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
