Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `t` and `T`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t < T`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 1
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`
   - `b` is `int(info[1])`
   - `i` is `b + 1`
   - `x` is undefined
   - `suma` is the sum calculated over all iterations of the loop.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `t` will be 2.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The value of `suma` will be updated to include the sum from the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` will be 2.
   - `a` remains `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` remains `int(info[1])`.
   - `i` remains `b + 1`.
   - `x` remains undefined.
   - `suma` is updated to include the sum from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is undefined, and `suma` is the sum calculated over all iterations of the loop including the previous one.**
