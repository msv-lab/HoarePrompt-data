Output State: **T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since `T` was initially a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), after executing this line of code, `T` remains a positive integer within the same range. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
