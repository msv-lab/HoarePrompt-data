Postcondition: `t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `k + 1`, `x` is `(a - (k + 1) * k) // (k + 1)`, `suma` is `suma + 1` if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is true. If the condition is false, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `suma` remain unchanged from the precondition.
