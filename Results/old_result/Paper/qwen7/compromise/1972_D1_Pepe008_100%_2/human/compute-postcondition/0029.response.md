Postcondition: `t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma` + 1 + x, `x` is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i, where the value of `x` is added to `suma` only if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` holds true; otherwise, the value of `suma` remains as `suma` + 1.
