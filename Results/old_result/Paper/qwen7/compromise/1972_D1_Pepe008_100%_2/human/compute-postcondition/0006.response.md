Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to the variable `x`. However, the value of `i` is not defined in the given code snippet, and it is not clear from the initial state what `i` might be. Since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. But we know that `x` is calculated using the formula provided, with `a` being `int(info[0])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
