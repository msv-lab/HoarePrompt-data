Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 1`, `x` is undefined, `suma` is the sum calculated over all iterations of the loop including the previous one, `info` is updated with the new input split into a list.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])` updates the values of `a` and `b` by converting the first and second elements of the `info` list to integers. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` is now `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, and `i` remains `int(info[1]) + 1`.
