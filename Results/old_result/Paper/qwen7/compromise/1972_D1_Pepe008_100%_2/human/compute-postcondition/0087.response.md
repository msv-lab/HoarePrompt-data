Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, b + 1)`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `b + 1`.
3. **Determine the initial values and changes**:
   - `t` remains 2.
   - `a` remains `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` remains at least 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from `int(info[1])`.
   - `x` is recalculated as `(int(info[0]) - int(info[1]) * (int(info[1]) - 1)) // (int(info[1]) - 1)`.
   - `suma` is incremented by 1 if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is true.

Given these points, let's determine the new state at the start of the next iteration:

- `t` remains 2.
- `a` remains `int(info[0])`.
- `b` remains at least 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, which was `int(info[1]) + 1`. Therefore, `i` becomes `int(info[1]) + 2`.
- `x` is recalculated based on the updated `i` value.
- `suma` is incremented by 1 if the condition is met; otherwise, it remains the same.

Now, let's calculate the new value of `x`:
\[ x = \frac{\text{a} - \text{i} \cdot (\text{i} - 1)}{\text{i} - 1} \]
Substituting the new value of `i`:
\[ x = \frac{\text{a} - (\text{int(info[1])} + 2) \cdot ((\text{int(info[1])} + 2) - 1)}{(\text{int(info[1])} + 2) - 1} \]
\[ x = \frac{\text{a} - (\text{int(info[1])} + 2) \cdot (\text{int(info[1])} + 1)}{\text{int(info[1])} + 1} \]

Since the exact value of `a` and `info[1]` is not given, we'll keep it in this form.

Finally, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 2`, `x` is recalculated as \(\frac{\text{a} - (\text{int(info[1])} + 2) \cdot (\text{int(info[1])} + 1)}{\text{int(info[1])} + 1}\), and `suma` is incremented by 1 if the condition \((\text{a} - \text{i} \cdot (\text{i} - 1)) // \text{i} ** 2 + 1 > 0\) is true.**
