Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma` + 1, `x` is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i.**

Explanation: The code `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. Therefore, `t` remains 0, `a` remains `int(info[0])`, `b` must still be at least 1, and `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The updated state for `suma` is `suma` plus 1.
