Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `suma` is `x`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i**, and the current value of `x ** 2 + 1` is greater than 0.

Explanation: The line `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. The value of `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Since `suma` was initially 0, after adding `x` to it, `suma` now holds the value of `x`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `x`) retain their original values from the initial state, and the condition that `x ** 2 + 1` is greater than 0 remains unchanged.
