Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`
   - `b` is `int(info[1])`
   - `suma` is `x + 1` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, and `suma` remains `0` otherwise, with `x` being `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`
   - `i` is the current value of the loop variable

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, b + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `b`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` such that `1 <= k < b`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `suma` is recalculated based on the new value of `i` in the next iteration.

6. **New State:**
   - `t` remains `1`
   - `a` remains `int(info[0])`
   - `b` remains `int(info[1])`
   - `i` becomes `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration)
   - `suma` is recalculated based on the new value of `i` in the next iteration, but its exact value is not specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `suma` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`**.
