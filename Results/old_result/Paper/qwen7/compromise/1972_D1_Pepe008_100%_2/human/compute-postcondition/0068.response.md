Output State: **t is 1, a is `int(info[0])`, b is `int(info[1])`, i is `b + 1`, x is undefined, and suma is the sum calculated over all iterations of the loop.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged at 1, `a` remains as the integer value of `info[0]`, and `b` remains as the integer value of `info[1]`. The variable `i` will be set to `b + 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `b` inclusive. The variable `x` is not defined outside the loop and will remain undefined. The variable `suma` will hold the total sum calculated over all iterations of the loop based on the conditions specified within the loop body.
