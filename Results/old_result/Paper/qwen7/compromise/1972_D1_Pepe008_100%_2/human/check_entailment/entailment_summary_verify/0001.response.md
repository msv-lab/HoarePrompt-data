### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because the formula and condition checks do not accurately reflect the problem requirements. Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement to confirm this conclusion.

1. **Problem Statement Recap**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it iterates over possible values of `i` from 1 to `b`.
   - The formula used in the program:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)
     \]
     This formula does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition checks:
     \[
     (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0 \quad \text{and} \quad i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0
     \]
     These conditions are irrelevant to the problem and do not help in determining the correct pairs.
   - The final adjustment `suma - 2` is unnecessary and incorrect.

Given these points, the program indeed does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses an inappropriate formula and irrelevant condition checks, leading to an incorrect solution.
