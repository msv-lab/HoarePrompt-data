You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 9999, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the maximum value of `b` passed into the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, and `suma` is the cumulative sum of all `x` values that satisfy the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` throughout the loop's iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to the total number of inputs processed, which is 9999 given the constraint `1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4`. The variable `a` retains its initial value as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `b` will be set to the highest value it reached during the loop's execution, and `i` will be one more than the final value of `b`. The variable `x` is calculated based on the last iteration's values, and `suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each iteration of the loop, adding 1 to `suma` if the specific condition is met for any `i`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The logic used in the program does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, let's consider the example from the problem statement: \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\). According to the problem, the valid pairs are:
- \((1, 1)\)
- \((2, 1)\)
- \((2, 2)\)
- \((3, 1)\)
- \((4, 1)\)
- \((5, 1)\)
- \((6, 1)\)
- \((6, 2)\)
- \((6, 3)\)
- \((7, 1)\)
- \((8, 1)\)
- \((9, 1)\)
- \((10, 1)\)
- \((10, 2)\)
- \((10, 3)\)

This gives us 14 valid pairs, but the program outputs 14, which seems correct for this specific example. However, the program's logic is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly.

For instance, consider \(n = 100\) and \(m = 1233\). The program outputs 153, but the correct number of valid pairs is 153, which means the program might be correct for this specific example as well, but the logic is not robust enough to handle all possible inputs correctly.

A more accurate implementation would involve checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) directly, rather than using the current heuristic approach. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
