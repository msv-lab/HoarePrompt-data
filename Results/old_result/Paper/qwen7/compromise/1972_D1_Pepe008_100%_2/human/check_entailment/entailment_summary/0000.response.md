Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `suma` to 0 for each test case, which is necessary to accumulate the count of valid pairs for each test case.

3. **Loop for Calculating Valid Pairs**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `b` (inclusive). For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate some value related to the conditions but doesn't directly relate to the problem statement.

4. **Condition Check**: The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is used to ensure that `x` is a positive integer before adding it to `suma`. However, this condition does not seem to directly relate to the problem constraints.

5. **Additional Condition Check**: The additional check `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is also present, but it is overly complex and does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, these conditions do not correctly reflect the requirement that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

6. **Final Output**: The final output is `suma - 2`, which subtracts 2 from the calculated sum. This subtraction is not explained and does not seem to be part of the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The conditions and calculations do not match the problem statement, and the final subtraction of 2 is not justified.

Correctness: **False**
