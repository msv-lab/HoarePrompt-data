The function accepts three parameters: `n`, representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `m`, representing the threshold for Sasha to win; and `nums`, a list of integers between 1 and 10^9. It calculates the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums`, subtracting the counts of zeros at even indices. If this result is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, it returns 'Sasha', otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
