Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves Sasha and Anna taking turns to modify a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of an integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers.
   - The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, and the remaining integer is checked against \(10^m\).
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to determine the winner based on the total length of the numbers and their zero counts.
   - `tot` calculates the total length of the numbers after reversing Anna's moves.
   - `cntvals` sorts the zero counts of the numbers in descending order.
   - The loop subtracts every other zero count from `tot`, effectively simulating Sasha's moves where he can concatenate smaller numbers to form larger ones.
   - The condition `tot >= m + 1` determines the winner.

3. **Analyzing `zerocnts`:**
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - It converts the number to a string, iterates backward to find the first non-zero digit, and counts the zeros before it.

### Checking the Logic

1. **Zero Counts Calculation:**
   - The `zerocnts` function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros.
   - This information is used to simulate Sasha's strategy of concatenating numbers to form larger ones.

2. **Total Length Calculation:**
   - The `tot` variable sums the lengths of the numbers after reversing Anna's moves.
   - Subtracting every other zero count simulates Sasha's moves, but this logic might be flawed because it doesn't fully capture the complexity of the game.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The condition `tot >= m + 1` checks if the remaining number is large enough for Sasha to win.
   - However, this condition only considers the total length and zero counts, ignoring the actual values and the strategic nature of the game.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's test the function with the provided examples to see if it behaves as expected:

```python
# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (2, 2, [14, 2]),
    (3, 5, [9, 56, 1]),
    (4, 10, [1, 2007, 800, 1580]),
    (4, 5, [5000, 123, 30, 4]),
    (10, 10, [6, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 10, 9, 10, 7]),
    (1, 1, [6]),
    (1, 10, [10]),
    (8, 9, [1, 2, 9, 10, 10, 2, 10, 2]),
    (4, 5, [10, 10, 10, 10])
]

# Expected results
expected_results = ["Sasha", "Anna", "Anna", "Sasha", "Sasha", "Anna", "Anna", "Anna", "Sasha"]

# Running the tests
results = []
for n, m, nums in test_cases:
    result = func_1(n, m, nums)
    results.append(result)

print(results == expected_results)
```

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing, the provided function does not correctly simulate the game's logic. The function incorrectly determines the winner by only considering the total length and zero counts, without accounting for the actual values and strategic moves.

**Correctness: **False**
