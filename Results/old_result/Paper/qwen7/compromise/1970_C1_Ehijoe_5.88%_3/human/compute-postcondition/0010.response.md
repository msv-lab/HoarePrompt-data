Based on the initial state provided:

- `empty` is `False`.
- `t` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it does not affect the print statement).
- `u` and `v` are equal to `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)` respectively.
- `n` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it does not affect the print statement).
- `tree` is a deque containing integers after processing all inputs with the integer `start` added to the end.
- `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.
- There exists at least one move in `moves` such that the move is odd.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Ron')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Ron'`.

Output: **Ron**
