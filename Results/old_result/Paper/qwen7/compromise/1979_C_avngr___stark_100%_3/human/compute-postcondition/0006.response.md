Output State: **`result` is equal to `func_1(func_1(result, numbers[1]), numbers[2])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `result` by applying the function `func_1` with the current `result` and the next element in the list `numbers`, which is `num` (i.e., `numbers[1]`). After that, `num` is updated to the next element in the list `numbers`, which is `numbers[2]`. Therefore, the new value of `result` is `func_1(func_1(result, numbers[1]), numbers[2])`. The initial condition that `numbers` must have at least three elements remains valid.
