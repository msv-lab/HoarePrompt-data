Output State: **`result` is equal to `func_1(result, num)` again, `numbers` must have at least three elements**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(result, num)` simply reassigns the value of `result` to the result of calling the function `func_1` with `result` and `num` as arguments. Since the initial state already had `result` equal to `func_1(result, num)`, after executing this line, `result` is now equal to the result of `func_1(result, num)` again. The precondition that `numbers` must have at least three elements remains unchanged.
