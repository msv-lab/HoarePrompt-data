Output State: **The program returns the value of `result` after applying `func_1` three times successively to `result`, `numbers[1]`, `numbers[2]`, and `numbers[3]` if they exist.**

This means that the program starts with the initial value of `result` and applies `func_1` to it with `numbers[1]`, then applies `func_1` again with the new result and `numbers[2]`, and finally applies `func_1` once more with the latest result and `numbers[3]` if the list `numbers` has at least four elements. The final value of `result` after these operations is what the program returns.
