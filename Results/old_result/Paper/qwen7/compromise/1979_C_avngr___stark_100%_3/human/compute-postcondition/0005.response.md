Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `num in numbers[1:]`. The variables involved here are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, meaning it starts from the second element of the `numbers` list.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `result` is equal to `func_1(result, num)` again (this means the result is updated based on the function call).
   - `numbers` must have at least three elements.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `numbers[1:]`, the next value of `num` would be the next element in the list after the current one.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must still have at least three elements.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `result` will be updated again based on the function call with the new `num`.
   - `num` will be the next element in `numbers[1:]`.
   - `numbers` must still have at least three elements.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `result` is equal to `func_1(result, num)` again.
- `num` will be the next element in `numbers[1:]`.
- `numbers` must have at least three elements.

Since we don't know the exact value of `num` or the specific element in the list, we can represent it as follows:

**State: **`result` is equal to `func_1(result, num)` again, `num` is the next element in `numbers[1:]`, `numbers` must have at least three elements**
