Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two positive integers `a` and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9, and a positive integer `t` within the range 1 to 10^4. For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `t`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases, and for each test case, it processes `a` and `b` to produce some output, but since the exact operation is not specified, the focus here is on the parameters and the implied structure of the function's operation.
