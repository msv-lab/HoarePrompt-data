Output State: The output consists of 't' lines, each containing either 'Yes' or 'No'. For each iteration, if either 'a' or 'b' is even, the output is 'Yes', otherwise it is 'No'. Given the initial state where 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, the output will depend on the values of 'a' and 'b' provided for each of the 't' iterations.
