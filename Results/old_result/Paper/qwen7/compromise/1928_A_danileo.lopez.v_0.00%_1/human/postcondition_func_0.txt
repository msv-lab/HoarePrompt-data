The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). It reads the number of test cases \(t\) first, then for each test case, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either is even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, it outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each case based on the condition.
