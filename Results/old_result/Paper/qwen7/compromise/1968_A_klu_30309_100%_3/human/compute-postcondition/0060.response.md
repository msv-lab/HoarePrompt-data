Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the iterations, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that maximizes `gcd_val + y`, `x` and `y` have completed all their iterations as defined in the loop, and `results` is a list containing `best_y`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(best_y)` adds the value of `best_y` to the list `results`. Since `best_y` is the `y` value that maximizes `gcd_val + y`, and `max_sum` is the highest sum of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the iterations, the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` have completed all their iterations as defined in the loop, and `results` now contains the value of `best_y`.
