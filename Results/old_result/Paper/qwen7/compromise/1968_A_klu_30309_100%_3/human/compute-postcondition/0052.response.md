Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x-2` and `x-3`, `y` is `x-3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-3)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, and `best_y` is `x-2`.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to be `gcd_val + y`. Given that `y` is `x-3`, `current_sum` is now `gcd_val + (x-3)`. The values of `gcd_val`, `y`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
