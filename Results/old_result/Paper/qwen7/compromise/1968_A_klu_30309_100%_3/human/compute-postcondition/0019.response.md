Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`.
   - `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`.
   - `best_y` is `x - 2` if `current_sum > max_sum`.
   - `x` is at least 2.
   - `y` is \(x - 2\).
   - `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and \(y = x - 2\).
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`.
   - `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` if `current_sum > max_sum`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `y` is defined as `range(x - 1, 0, -1)`. This means `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was `x - 2`.

4. **Next Value of `y`:**
   - Since `y` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `y` will be `x - 3`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `x` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `x`.
   - `gcd_val` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `gcd_val`.
   - `current_sum` may change depending on the loop body, but we need to consider the condition under which `current_sum` is updated.

6. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `y` is greater than 0. Therefore, `y` must be `x - 3` for the loop to continue.

7. **Summary of Adjusted States:**
   - `y` changes to `x - 3`.
   - `current_sum` remains the same unless the loop body updates it.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 3\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and \(y = x - 2\), `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)` or `gcd_val + (x - 3)` depending on the loop body.**
