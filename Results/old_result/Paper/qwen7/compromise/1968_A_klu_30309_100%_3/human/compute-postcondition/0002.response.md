Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is 0.**

The code initializes `max_sum` to 0, which does not affect the values of `results`, `t`, `test_cases`, or the conditions associated with them. Therefore, these variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
