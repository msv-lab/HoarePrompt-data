Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x-2` and `x-3`, `y` is `x-3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-3)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `best_y` is `x-3`, and `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`.**

Explanation: The code `best_y = y` assigns the current value of `y` (which is `x-3`) to `best_y`. All other variables (`gcd_val`, `y`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
