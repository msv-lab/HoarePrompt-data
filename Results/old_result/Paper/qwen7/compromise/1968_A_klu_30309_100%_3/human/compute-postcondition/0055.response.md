Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x-2` and `x-3`, `y` is `x-3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-3)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `best_y` is `x-3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions and adds the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
