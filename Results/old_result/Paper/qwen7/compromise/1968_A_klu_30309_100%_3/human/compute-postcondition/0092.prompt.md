Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for x in test_cases:
    max_sum = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
        current_sum = gcd_val + y
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            best_y = y
            break
    results.append(best_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is now a list containing the single element `best_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` obtained from the loop for each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value when `max_sum` was updated, `x` is the last value of `x` processed in the loop, `y` is the last value of `y` processed in the loop, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the iterations, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that maximizes `gcd_val + y`, `x` and `y` have completed all their iterations as defined in the loop, and `results` is a list containing `best_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` contains `best_y`, `max_sum` retains its value, `best_y` retains its value, `x` retains its value, `y` retains its value, `gcd_val` retains its value, `current_sum` retains its value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
