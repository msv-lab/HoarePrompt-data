Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`**.

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` simply assigns the current value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `y` is defined as `x - 3`, `best_y` now holds the value `x - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
