Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function. Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, the GCD of `x` and `x - 1` is calculated and stored in the variable `gcd_val`. The values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `x` remain unchanged.
