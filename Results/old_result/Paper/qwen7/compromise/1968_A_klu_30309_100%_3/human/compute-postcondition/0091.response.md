Output State: `results` is a list containing the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after the loop has executed all iterations. The list will have the same length as `test_cases`. For each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the value of `y` (where \(2 \leq y < x\)) that maximizes the expression `gcd_val + y`, with `gcd_val` being the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. The loop processes each `x` in `test_cases` exactly once, and for each `x`, it finds the corresponding `best_y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y` and appends it to `results`. After all iterations, `results` will contain the optimal `best_y` for every `x` in `test_cases`.
