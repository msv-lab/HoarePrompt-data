Output State: `results` is a list containing the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after the loop has executed all iterations. The loop processes each `x` in `test_cases` exactly once, finding the `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`). For each `x`, the corresponding `best_y` is appended to `results`. After all iterations, `results` will contain one element for each `x` in `test_cases`, representing the optimal `y` for each `x`.

The other variables retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop: `max_sum` holds the highest `current_sum` found across all iterations, `x` holds the last `x` value processed, `y` holds the last `y` value processed, `gcd_val` holds the last calculated greatest common divisor, and `current_sum` holds the last calculated sum. However, these values are not included in the `results` list but are relevant for understanding the state of the loop's execution.
