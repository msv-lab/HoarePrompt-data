Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-2`, `y` is `x-2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`**

Explanation: The code updates `gcd_val` to be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. Given that `y` is `x-2`, `gcd_val` is now the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-2`. The values of `y`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
