Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-1`, `y` is `x-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x-1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional was specified, we assume it breaks out of an implied loop or conditional context. All variables retain their initial values, and the break statement indicates that we exit the loop or conditional.
