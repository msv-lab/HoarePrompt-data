Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next value of `x` in `test_cases`, `y` is the last value of `y` processed in the loop, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The line `best_y = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `best_y`. All other variables (`max_sum`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
