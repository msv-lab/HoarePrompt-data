Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `max_sum` will hold the maximum value of `current_sum` found during the loop's execution, `best_y` will be the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`, `x` will be the last value it was set to in the `test_cases` sequence, `y` will be the last value it iterated through (which is `x - 1`), `gcd_val` will be `math.gcd(x, x - 1)` (since the loop will eventually check this pair of values), `current_sum` will be `gcd_val + (x - 1)`, and the loop will have broken out of the innermost loop or if statement when `current_sum` was found to be greater than `max_sum`. If no such `y` exists that makes `current_sum` greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` and `best_y` will retain their values from before the loop started.
