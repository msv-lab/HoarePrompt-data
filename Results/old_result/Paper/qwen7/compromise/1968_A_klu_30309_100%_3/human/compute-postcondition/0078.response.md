Output State: **`max_sum` is `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged from their initial states.
