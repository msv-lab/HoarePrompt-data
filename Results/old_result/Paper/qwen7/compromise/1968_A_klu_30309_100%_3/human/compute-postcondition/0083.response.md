Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to the current value of `current_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
