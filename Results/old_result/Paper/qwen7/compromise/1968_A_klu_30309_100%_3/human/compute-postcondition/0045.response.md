Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-2`, `y` is `x-2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to the current value of `current_sum`. Since `current_sum` is defined as `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `max_sum` is also updated to `gcd_val + (x-2)`. The values of `gcd_val`, `y`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.
