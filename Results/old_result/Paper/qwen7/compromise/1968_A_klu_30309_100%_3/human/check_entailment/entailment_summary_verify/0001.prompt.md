You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it finds the best `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`). It returns a list `results` containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `x`.
   - This part is correctly implemented using a list comprehension.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the test cases.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - For each test case `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd`.
   - It computes the sum `gcd_val + y`.
   - If this sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`. The loop breaks early because we only need the first such `y` that maximizes the sum.

4. **Result Collection:**
   - After processing all `y` for the current `x`, it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints each element in the `results` list.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Problem Requirement:** Find any `y` (1 ≤ y < x) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- **Implementation Check:**
  - The program correctly iterates over all possible `y` values from `x-1` down to 1.
  - It uses `math.gcd` to compute the GCD.
  - It checks if the current sum is greater than the previously recorded maximum sum and updates accordingly.
  - The loop breaks early once the maximum sum is found, ensuring efficiency.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the desired `y` for each test case. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
