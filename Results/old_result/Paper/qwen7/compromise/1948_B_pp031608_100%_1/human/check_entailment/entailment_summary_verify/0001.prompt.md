You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the sequence of integers can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by ensuring no two consecutive elements violate a specific order condition. If any changes are needed, it makes the necessary adjustments. After processing all test cases, it outputs "YES" if the sequence can be transformed as required, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - An array `arr` is created from the input elements.
   - A boolean variable `ans` is initialized to `True`, indicating that the array is initially considered sortable.

3. **Checking Sortability**:
   - The program iterates backward through the array starting from the last element.
   - For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous one (`arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`).
   - If it finds such an element, it splits the larger element into its digits and checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
   - If the digits are not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting**:
   - The program attempts to split the larger element into its digits and check if the resulting list is sorted.
   - However, the logic for checking if the digits are sorted is flawed. It simply concatenates the digits and checks if the concatenated list is sorted, which does not guarantee that the original elements can be rearranged to form a sorted array.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is already sorted or when the array can be made sorted by splitting elements.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program correctly identifies that splitting `45` and `67` can make the array sorted. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array by repeatedly splitting larger elements into their digits. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        def can_sort(arr):
            while True:
                sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
                if arr == sorted_arr:
                    return True
                for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
                    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                        num_str = str(arr[i - 1])
                        new_num = int(num_str + str(arr[i]))
                        if new_num >= 10:
                            arr[i - 1] = new_num
                            arr.pop(i)
                            break
                else:
                    return False
        
        if can_sort(arr):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```
