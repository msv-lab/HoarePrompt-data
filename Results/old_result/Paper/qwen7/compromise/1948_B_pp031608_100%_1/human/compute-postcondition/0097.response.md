Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `ans` is `False` if the elements in `nums` are not sorted in non-decreasing order. If the elements in `nums` are not sorted, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
