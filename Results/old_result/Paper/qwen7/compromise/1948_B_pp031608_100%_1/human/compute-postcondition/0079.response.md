Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]` if no swap was made during the last iteration, and `arr[i]` is unchanged or adjusted according to the loop conditions, `ans` is `True`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = True` sets the variable `ans` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
