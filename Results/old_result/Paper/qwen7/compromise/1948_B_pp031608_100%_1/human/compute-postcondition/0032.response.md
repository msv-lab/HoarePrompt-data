Postcondition: `ans` remains False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` and the current value of `arr[i]` converted to integers. If the condition `nums != sorted(nums)` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
