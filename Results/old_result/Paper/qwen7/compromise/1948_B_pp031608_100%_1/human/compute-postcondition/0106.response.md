Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `arr[i-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is the last element in `nums`; if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `nums` is sorted, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.
