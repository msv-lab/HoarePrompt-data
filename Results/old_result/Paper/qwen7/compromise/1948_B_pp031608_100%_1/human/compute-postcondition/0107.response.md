Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, `arr[i-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is the last element in `nums`; `arr[i-1]` is updated to `nums[0]`, and the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i-1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Since `arr[i-1]` was initially equal to `nums[0]`, the value of `arr[i-1]` remains the same. The rest of the conditions and the postcondition remain unchanged.
