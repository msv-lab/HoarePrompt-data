Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`
   - `m`

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `m - 1` to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means the loop starts at `m - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `1`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - **`i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was at least 1. For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 but less than `m`.
   - **`m`:** `m` remains unchanged within the loop body.

4. **Postcondition Analysis:**
   - `ans` remains `False`.
   - `i` is at least 1.
   - The current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`.
   - `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by the current value of `arr[i]`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is decremented by 1 each iteration, if the loop continues, `i` will be `i - 1` (which was at least 1).
   - `m` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.
   - `ans` remains `False`.
   - The condition for `arr[i]` and `nums` still holds because the loop body does not change these values directly.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 0, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by the current value of `arr[i]`**. 

However, since `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue, we can refine this to:

**State: **`ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by the current value of `arr[i]`**.
