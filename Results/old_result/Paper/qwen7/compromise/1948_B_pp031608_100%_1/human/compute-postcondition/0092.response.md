Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = m - 1` down to `i = 1` (since `i` starts at `m - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0).

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that the element at index `i-1` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `ans` is `False` if the elements in `nums` are not sorted (i.e., not in non-decreasing order). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, then `ans` is set to `True` and the elements in `nums` are sorted. Otherwise, `ans` remains `False` and the elements in `nums` are not sorted.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be decremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be greater than 0. Therefore, `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Given the above points, let's update the states:

- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` is updated to `i - 1`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `nums` remains unchanged.
- `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes it, but since no specific action is mentioned for the loop body, we assume `ans` remains `False`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that the element at index `i-1` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `ans` is `False` if the elements in `nums` are not sorted (i.e., not in non-decreasing order). `i` must be greater than 0.**
