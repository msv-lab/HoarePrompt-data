Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that the element at index `i-1` is less than the element at index `i`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`.**

Explanation: The code converts the integer at index `i-1` of the array `arr` into a list of its digits using a list comprehension and concatenates it with the integer at index `i` of the array `arr`. The precondition that the element at index `i-1` is less than the element at index `i` remains valid. The new variable `nums` is created with the updated values.
