Postcondition: `ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 0, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and the list `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the first digit of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, the values of `ans`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.
