Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and now `n` holds the value of the integer input, which is constrained between 2 and 50.
