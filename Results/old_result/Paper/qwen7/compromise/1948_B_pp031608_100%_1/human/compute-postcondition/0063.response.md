Postcondition: `i` is between 1 and `m-2`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the elements of `nums` are checked for sorting. If they are not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.
