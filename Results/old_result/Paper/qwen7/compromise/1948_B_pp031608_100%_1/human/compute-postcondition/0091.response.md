Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that the element at index `i-1` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `ans` is `False` if the elements in `nums` are not sorted (i.e., not in non-decreasing order). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, then `ans` is set to `True` and the elements in `nums` are sorted. Otherwise, `ans` remains `False` and the elements in `nums` are not sorted.
