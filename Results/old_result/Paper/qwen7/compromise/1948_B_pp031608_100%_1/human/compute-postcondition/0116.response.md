Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the sequence of integers can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by ensuring no two consecutive elements violate a specific order condition. If any changes are needed, it makes the necessary adjustments. After processing all test cases, it outputs "YES" if the sequence can be transformed as required, otherwise "NO".**
