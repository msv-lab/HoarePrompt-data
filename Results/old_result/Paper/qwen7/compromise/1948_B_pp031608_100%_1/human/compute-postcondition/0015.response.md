Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` must be a positive integer, `i` must be at least 0, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and the list `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the first digit of `arr[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, which is `nums[0]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `nums` now contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the first digit of `arr[i]`.
