You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: `u` is a falsy value (0), `a` is a list with at least 7 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()` after the loop has finished executing, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the cumulative results of the additions and comparisons performed within the loop for all iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `u` will be a falsity value (0) because the loop condition `u` is no longer true. The list `a` will have at least 7 elements due to the updates made within the loop. The variables `c` and `d` will hold the most recent values returned by the function `r()` after the loop has finished executing. The list `b` will remain unchanged from its final state after the last iteration of the loop, with the last two elements being the cumulative results of the additions and comparisons performed during all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities.
   - The cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin.
   - The cost of traveling directly between two cities is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the cities and the number of queries.
   - It then processes the queries using a strange-looking calculation involving `zip` and list manipulations.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The coordinates are stored with an extra boundary value (`-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0`).
   - The list `b` is being updated in a way that seems to involve cumulative sums and some kind of distance calculation.
   - The final result for each query is derived from the list `b`.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The code uses a fixed approach to calculate distances and doesn't seem to correctly handle the closest city logic.
   - The use of `zip` and the cumulative sums might be intended to calculate distances, but the implementation is unclear and likely incorrect.
   - The final results for queries do not match the expected outputs based on the problem description.

5. **Expected Behavior:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we should:
     - Identify the closest city for each city.
     - Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to minimize the cost of travel.
     - Calculate the minimum cost for each query based on the closest city logic.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It appears to be attempting a complex calculation without clearly defining the steps or logic.
