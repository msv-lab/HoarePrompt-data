Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issue.

1. The program reads input but does not process it according to the problem description.
2. The variable `a` is constructed with additional boundary values (`-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0`), which do not seem to serve any purpose in the context of finding the closest city.
3. The variables `b` are initialized incorrectly and updated in a manner that does not reflect the logic required to solve the problem.
4. The logic for calculating the minimum number of coins to travel between two cities is not implemented correctly.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- Cities are located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.
- Queries are: `(1, 4)`, `(1, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 2)`, `(5, 1)`.

The expected outputs are `3`, `8`, `1`, `4`, `14`.

However, the provided code does not correctly compute these results. For instance, for the query `(1, 4)`, the expected output is `3` (as explained in the problem statement), but the code does not produce this result due to its incorrect implementation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
