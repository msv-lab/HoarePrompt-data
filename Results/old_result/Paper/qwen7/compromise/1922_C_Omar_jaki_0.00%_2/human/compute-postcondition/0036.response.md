Postcondition: **`b` is a list with three elements where the first element is `0 + v_3`, the second element is `v_3 + v_3`, and the third element is `v_3 + v_3`, `x` is `w_3`, `y` is `x`, `z` is `y`, `v` is `v_3`, `u` is `u - 1`, `c` is the return value from function `r()`, `d` is the return value from function `r()`.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since there are no changes made to the variables within the if or else blocks. The variables `b`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `v`, `u`, `c`, and `d` retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
