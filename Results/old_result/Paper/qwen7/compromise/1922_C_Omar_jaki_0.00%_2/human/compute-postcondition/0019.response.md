Output State: **`b` is a list with three elements where the first element is `0 + v_3`, the second element is `v_3 + v_3`, and the third element is `v_3 + v_3`, `x` is `w_3`, `y` is `x`, `z` is `y`, `v` is `v_3`, `u` is the value returned by `r()`**.

Explanation: The code `u, = r()` assigns the value returned by the function `r()` to the variable `u`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `b`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states. The output state includes the updated value of `u`.
