Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list with at least 6 elements, `u` is the return value from function `r()`, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`, `b` is a list where each element is updated based on the conditions within the loop.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least 6 elements, `u` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `c` is the return value from function `r()`, and `d` is the return value from function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` remains the return value from function `r()` and `d` remains the return value from function `r()`. Otherwise, `c` is the return value from function `r()` and `d` is the return value from function `r()`, with the condition that `c` is not less than `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `c` is the return value from function `r()`, and `d` is the return value from function `r()`. The function does not change the values of `u`, `c`, and `d` regardless of the condition `c < d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u` is a falsy value, `c` is the return value from function `r()`, `d` is the return value from function `r()`. Regardless of whether `c < d` is true or false, the values of `u`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
