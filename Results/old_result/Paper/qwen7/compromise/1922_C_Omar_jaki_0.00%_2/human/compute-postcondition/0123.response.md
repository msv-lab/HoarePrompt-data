Output State: **`u` is a falsy value, `c` is the return value from function `r()`, `d` is the return value from function `r()`**

Explanation: The code `c, d = r()` assigns the return values of the function `r()` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `r()` returns some value, `c` and `d` now hold these return values. The variable `u` remains unchanged as it was initially a falsy value and is not affected by the assignment operation.
