Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `u` is a falsy value (e.g., `False`, `0`, `None`, `[]`, `{}`, etc.).
   - `c` is the return value from function `r()`.
   - `d` is the return value from function `r()`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `c` and `d` are both the return values from the function `r()`. Since no specific return type or behavior of `r()` is mentioned, we assume `r()` returns a value that can be used as an index (e.g., an integer).

Let's denote the return values of `r()` as follows:
- Let `c = x` (an integer returned by `r()`).
- Let `d = y` (another integer returned by `r()`).

Given these values, the expression inside the print statement becomes:
```python
b[x * 2 - 1] - b[y * 2 - 1]
```

Since `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `b[x * 2 - 1]` and `b[y * 2 - 1]`. However, the print statement will evaluate these expressions and subtract the second result from the first.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **b[x * 2 - 1] - b[y * 2 - 1]** (where `x` and `y` are the return values of `r()`).
