### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The code iterates through the array to find the longest subsequence where elements are the same (`val`).
   - It counts the length of this subsequence (`cnt`).
   - The minimum number of removals required to break the beauty of the array is calculated as the minimum count of any such subsequence.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the array is already uniform.
   - The calculation of the minimum number of removals is sound, as it finds the longest subsequence of identical elements and calculates the removals needed to break this subsequence.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for handling the case where the array is not uniform. The current implementation only considers the longest subsequence of identical elements and does not ensure that the array is no longer beautiful after removals.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    3
    2 2 2
    5
    1 2 1 2 1
    1
    1
    7
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    ```

- **Test Case 2**:
  - The code correctly identifies that the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is not uniform and prints `1`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - The code incorrectly prints `-1` for the array `[1]`. Since the array is uniform, the code should print `-1`.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - The code correctly identifies that the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` is not uniform and prints `3`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The code fails to handle the case where the array is uniform correctly. It should print `-1` for uniform arrays, but it currently prints `0` (since `ans` is initialized to infinity and never updated).

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the array is uniform correctly.
