You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5; additionally, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer; `flag` is set to False if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is set to True.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: Output State: `val` is equal to `arr[n-1]`, `cnt` is 0, `flag` is True, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found during the loop execution.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `val` is equal to `arr[n-1]`, `cnt` is 0, `flag` is True/False, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found during the loop execution, and `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information about the array a based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
