Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5; additionally, `arr` is a list of integers where consecutive elements are checked for equality, and `flag` is set to False if any two consecutive elements are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True.
