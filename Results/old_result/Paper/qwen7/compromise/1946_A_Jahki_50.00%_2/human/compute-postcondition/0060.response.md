Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 1, `new_median` is equal to the value at index `ma-1` of list `b` and `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `b[ma]` is increased by 1, `op` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `op` by 1 while keeping the other variables in their respective initial conditions.
