Output State: **All test cases have been processed. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases and does not change within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `num - 1` since the loop runs from `0` to `num-1`. For each test case, the variable `num2` will be the last input integer provided for that case. The variable `case` will be the last string input for that case. The variable `op` will be the total number of operations performed across all test cases. The variable `b` will be a sorted list of integers for each test case, where each element has been incremented by 1 starting from the middle index `ma` until `new_median` exceeds `median`. The variable `median` will be the original median value before any increments for each test case.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, all test cases have been processed, and the final state of each test case is as described above. The loop has completed its execution, and no further changes will occur to the variables outside the loop.
