Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `median` is `b[ma]`; `b[ma]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `b[ma]` (which is part of the list `b` and represents the median) is incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their initial or previously stated conditions.
