Output State: **`case` is a string input from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer less than or equal to 10000 and is currently even, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`**.

This means that the variable `ma` is calculated as half of `num2` (integer division), minus 1. Since `num2` is an even integer less than or equal to 10000, `ma` will be an integer value that is half of `num2` rounded down, then decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
