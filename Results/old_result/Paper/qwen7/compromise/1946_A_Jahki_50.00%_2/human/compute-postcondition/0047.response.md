Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `a` and assigns the result to `b`. The sorting operation does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the values of `case`, `t`, `i`, `num2`, `total`, `students`, `new_median`, `op`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is created and contains the sorted elements of `a`.
