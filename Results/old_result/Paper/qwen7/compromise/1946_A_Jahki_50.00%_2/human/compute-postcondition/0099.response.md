Output State: **`b` is sorted in ascending order; `new_median` must be greater than `median`; `op` is 1 more than its original value; `b[ma]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` in ascending order, which was already sorted in the initial state, so the sorting does not change the list. The other variables (`new_median`, `op`, and `b[ma]`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
