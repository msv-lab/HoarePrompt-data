Output State: **`b` is sorted in ascending order; `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `b[ma]` to the variable `new_median`. The list `b` remains sorted in ascending order as no operations were performed that would alter its order. The variable `ma` is assumed to be defined and holds an index within the bounds of list `b`, though its specific value is not provided, so `new_median` is set to the element at index `ma` in the list `b`.
