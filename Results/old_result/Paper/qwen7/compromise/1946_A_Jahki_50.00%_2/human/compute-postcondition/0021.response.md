Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is less than `median`, `b[ma]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1. Since no specific value for `ma` or the initial value of `b[ma]` is given, we assume `b[ma]` was 0 before the operation (as it's the most common default value for such operations). After the operation, `b[ma]` becomes 1. The other variables (`total`, `students`, `new_median`, and `median`) remain unchanged according to the precondition. `students` is specified to be 2 less than its initial value and must be greater or equal to 1, which implies `students` is now 1. `new_median` must be less than `median`, which remains true.
