Output State: **`b` is sorted in ascending order; `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`; `op` is 1 more than its original value; `b[ma]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. This means `new_median` is now equal to `b[ma]`. The other variables (`b`, `op`, and `b[ma]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
