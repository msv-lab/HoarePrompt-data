Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `num2` is an integer input from the user.**

In this case, the code `num2 = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
