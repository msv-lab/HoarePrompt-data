Postcondition: **`case` is a string input from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer. If `num2` is greater than 10000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`, and `b` is a sorted list of `a`.**
