Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 3, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, and `b` is sorted again.**

Explanation: The code sets `new_median` to the value of `b[ma]`. Given that `ma` was previously incremented by 1, `ma` now refers to the element at the position `ma-1` plus one, which is simply `ma`. Since `b` is sorted before and after this line of code, and no other changes are made to the variables, the output state reflects these updates.
