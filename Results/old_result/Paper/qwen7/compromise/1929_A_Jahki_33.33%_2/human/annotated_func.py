#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and num2 is not used and can be ignored as it does not appear in the problem description or the function definition.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `order` will be the count of consecutive elements in the list `a` where each element is less than or equal to the previous one. The variable `i` will be equal to `num2`, and `num2` must be greater than 1. The values of `a` and `num2` will remain unchanged from their initial values, but `order` will reflect the number of such consecutive pairs found in the list `a`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `order` will be the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to its predecessor, starting from the second element up to the second-to-last element. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `num2`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements it was supposed to, and `order` will show how many times the specified condition was met.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and returns `True` if no consecutive elements in the list are greater than the previous one (starting from the second element), otherwise it returns `False`.
