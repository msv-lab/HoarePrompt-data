State: **`order` is 0, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, num2)`.
2. The range function in Python generates numbers from the start value (inclusive) up to, but not including, the stop value (exclusive).
3. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must include the number 1. This means that `num2` must be greater than 1.
4. The variable `i` starts at 1 according to the range definition.
5. The variable `order` is not involved in the loop's execution condition and is not modified within the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 1 and `num2` being greater than 1.
