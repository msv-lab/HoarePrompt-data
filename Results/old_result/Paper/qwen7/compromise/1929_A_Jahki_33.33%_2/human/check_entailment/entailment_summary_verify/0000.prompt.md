You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `a` and returns `True` if no consecutive elements in the list are greater than the previous one (starting from the second element), otherwise it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the `func_1` function and how the main logic is implemented.

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `True`, which means no rearrangement is needed, and the program prints `0`. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty.
   - For example, consider the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. The function `func_1` would return `False` because the array is not sorted, but the correct rearrangement to maximize beauty would be `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, resulting in a beauty of `57`.

2. **Incorrect Main Logic:**
   - The main logic sorts the array and calculates the beauty using the sorted array. This approach might not always yield the maximum beauty. For instance, in the example `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, but the correct rearrangement is `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, which results in a beauty of `57`.
   - A more effective approach would involve finding the minimum and maximum values and arranging them optimally to maximize the sum of differences.

To fix the program, you need to implement a different strategy to find the maximum beauty, such as:
- Finding the minimum and maximum values and placing them at the ends of the array.
- Ensuring the array is arranged in a way that maximizes the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
