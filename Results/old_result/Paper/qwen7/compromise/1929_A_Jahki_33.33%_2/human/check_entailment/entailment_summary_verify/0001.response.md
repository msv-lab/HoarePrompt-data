### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the differences `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1`. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the highest possible beauty.

However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns `True`, and the program prints `0`.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns `False`, and the program proceeds to sort the array and calculate the beauty.

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order using `sorted(a)`.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted (returns `0`).
   - It also correctly handles cases where the array needs to be rearranged (calculates the beauty correctly).

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it in ascending order and then calculating the beauty. The function `func_1` is not strictly necessary for the core functionality, but it does help in identifying if no rearrangement is needed.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
