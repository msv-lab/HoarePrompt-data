### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the difference between consecutive elements. Sorting ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed at opposite ends, maximizing the positive differences.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It calls a function `func_1` which checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, the beauty is 0 because the differences between consecutive elements would be minimized.
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and counts the number of times an element is less than or equal to its predecessor.
   - If this count is zero, the array is sorted, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the array is sorted.
   - If the array is sorted, the program correctly prints 0.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
