### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the solution step-by-step.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `True`, indicating no rearrangement is needed, and the program prints `0`. However, this does not guarantee the maximum beauty.
   - Example: For the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, `func_1` would return `False` because the array is not sorted, but the correct rearrangement to maximize beauty would be `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, resulting in a beauty of `57`.

2. **Incorrect Main Logic:**
   - The main logic sorts the array and calculates the beauty using the sorted array. This approach might not always yield the maximum beauty. For instance, in the example `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, but the correct rearrangement is `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, which results in a beauty of `57`.
   - A more effective approach would involve finding the minimum and maximum values and arranging them optimally to maximize the sum of differences.

#### Correct Approach:

To find the maximum beauty, we should:
1. Identify the smallest and largest elements in the array.
2. Place these elements at the ends of the array.
3. Arrange the remaining elements in a way that maximizes the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Here's a revised version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    
    # Find the minimum and maximum values
    min_val = min(a)
    max_val = max(a)
    
    # Remove the min and max values from the list
    a.remove(min_val)
    a.remove(max_val)
    
    # Sort the remaining elements
    a.sort()
    
    # Calculate the beauty
    beauty = (max_val - min_val) + sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, len(a)))
    
    print(beauty)
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis and the corrected approach, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program did not correctly calculate the maximum beauty due to the flawed logic in both `func_1` and the main logic.

**Final: False**
