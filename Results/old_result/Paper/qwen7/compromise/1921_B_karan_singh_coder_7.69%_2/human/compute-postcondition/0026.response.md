Output State: **`cnt` is 6, `s1` is the number of '1's in the input string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the newly input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 8, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `t` is the newly input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`**.

Explanation: The code `t1 = t.count('1')` counts the number of '1's in the string `t` and assigns the result to `t1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
