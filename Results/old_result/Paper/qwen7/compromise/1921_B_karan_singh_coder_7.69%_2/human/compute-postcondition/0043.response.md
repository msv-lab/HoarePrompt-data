Output State: **`cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `i` is `n`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`cnt`, `i`, `s1`, `t1`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
