Output State: **`cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `i` is `n`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`.**

Explanation: The code `t = input()` reads a new string from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This changes the value of `t` to the newly input string, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
