Output State: **`s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is a new input string.**

The code `s1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s` and assigns the count to the variable `s1`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
