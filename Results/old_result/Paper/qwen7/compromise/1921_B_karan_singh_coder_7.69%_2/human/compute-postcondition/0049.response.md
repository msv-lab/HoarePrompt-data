State: **`cnt` is 0, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0** 

Explanation:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
- Whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.
- Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 because the loop starts with the first iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (must be greater than 0) and `i` (must be 0).
