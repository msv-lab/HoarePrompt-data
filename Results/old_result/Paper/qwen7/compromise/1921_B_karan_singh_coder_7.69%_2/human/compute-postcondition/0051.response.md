Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 1
   - `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`
   - `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`
   - `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`
   - `s` is the newly input string
   - `t` is the newly input string `t`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must remain the same (since it was already specified to be greater than 0 and no change was made to it in the loop body).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1
- `n` remains the same (greater than 0)

The other variables (`cnt`, `t1`, `s1`, `d`, `s`, `t`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State**:
State: **`cnt` is 1, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
