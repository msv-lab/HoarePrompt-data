Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t1`, `s1`, `d`, `s`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
