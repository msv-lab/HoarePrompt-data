Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is 9, `n` must be greater than 9**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. However, since the initial state does not provide the values of `s` and `t`, and no specific values for these strings are given, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `cnt` starts at 0. The value of `i` remains 9, and `n` must still be greater than 9.
