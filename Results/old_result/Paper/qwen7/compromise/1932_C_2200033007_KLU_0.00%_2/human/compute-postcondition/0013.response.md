Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. Then, it calculates a reversed list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element. Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.**
