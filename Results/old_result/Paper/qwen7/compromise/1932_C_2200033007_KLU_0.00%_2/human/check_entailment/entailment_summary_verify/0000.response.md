### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The problem requires calculating the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` at the beginning of each command execution.
   - Based on the command (`'L'` or `'R'`), the leftmost or rightmost element is removed from the array `a`.
   - The output should be a sequence of remainders calculated at each step.

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the command direction ('L' or 'R').
   - It then calculates a reversed list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element.
   - The function returns the reversed list `ans`.

3. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and appends elements from `a` to `b` based on the command direction.
   - After constructing `b`, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and appends the results to `ans`.
   - However, this approach does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the current state of the array `a` before appending to `b`.

4. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the current state of the array `a` before appending to `b`.
   - The program instead appends elements directly and then calculates the product, which leads to incorrect results.

Given the analysis, the program does not follow the problem description correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
