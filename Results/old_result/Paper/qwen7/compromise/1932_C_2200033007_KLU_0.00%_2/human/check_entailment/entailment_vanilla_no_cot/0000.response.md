Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates the product of the array elements in a way that does not match the required operations. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of elements in reverse order of their removal, which is not what the problem requires. It should calculate the product of the remaining elements after each removal.

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations**: The program appends elements to the `b` list based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R', but then it calculates the product in reverse order, which does not reflect the sequence of operations as described.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        p = (p * a[i]) % m
        b.append(p)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return b
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the product of the remaining elements after each removal and appends the result to the list `b` in the correct order.
