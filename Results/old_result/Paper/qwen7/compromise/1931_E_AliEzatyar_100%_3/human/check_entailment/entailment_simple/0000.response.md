Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the input number `num`. This is verified by the logic inside the function, which iterates over the string representation of `num` in reverse order until it encounters a non-zero digit.
2. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and initializes an array to store the answers.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the list of integers.
   - It calculates the total number of digits in the list and identifies the number of trailing zeros in each number.
   - It sorts the list of zeros in descending order.
   - It then checks if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the largest even number of zeros is at least `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
   - The logic seems to follow the rules of the game correctly, considering the optimal play scenario where players aim to leave Sasha with a number that is not less than \(10^m\).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to implement the rules correctly and should produce the expected results for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
