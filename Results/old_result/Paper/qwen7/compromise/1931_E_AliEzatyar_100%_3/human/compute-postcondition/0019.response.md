Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `counter` will be equal to the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`, and `i` will be less than or equal to -1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `counter` will hold the count of consecutive '0's from the end of the string `num`. The variable `i` will point to an index that is less than or equal to -1, indicating that the loop has processed all characters of `num` from the end to the beginning.
