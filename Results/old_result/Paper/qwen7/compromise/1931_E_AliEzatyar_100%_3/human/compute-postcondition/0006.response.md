Output State: **`counter` is 0, `num` is a non-empty string or integer, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and the last character of `num` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `counter`, `num`, `i`, and the condition about the last character of `num`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
