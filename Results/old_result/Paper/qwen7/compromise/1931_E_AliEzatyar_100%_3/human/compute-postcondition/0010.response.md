Output State: **`counter` is either 2 or 1, `num` is a non-empty string or integer, `i` is `len(num) - 2`**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. Since `counter` was either 1 or 0 initially, it will now be either 2 (if it was 1) or 1 (if it was 0). The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
