### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - It correctly parses the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.

2. **Permutation and Array Reading:**
   - The program reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Path Calculation for Bodya:**
   - The program initializes `pathb` to store the scores Bodya would get if he stays at his current position and moves to the next one according to the permutation.
   - It uses a `vis` array to ensure it doesn't revisit positions, which is crucial for avoiding infinite loops.
   - The loop correctly calculates the scores for Bodya's path.

4. **Path Calculation for Sasha:**
   - Similarly, the program initializes `paths` to store the scores Sasha would get if she stays at her current position and moves to the next one according to the permutation.
   - It uses a `vis` array to ensure it doesn't revisit positions.
   - The loop correctly calculates the scores for Sasha's path.

5. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya (`resb`) and Sasha (`ress`) using a loop that iterates up to `k` turns.
   - It correctly updates the scores based on the remaining turns.

6. **Result Determination:**
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Issues Identified:
- The program uses `YES` and `NO` variables defined at the beginning but never uses them. These should be removed as they are not needed.
- The program correctly handles the case where `k` is less than the length of the path by breaking the loop when `k < i + 1`. This ensures that the scores are calculated only for the relevant turns.
- The program assumes that the paths will be fully traversed within `k` turns, which is correct since the paths are finite and the loop breaks early if `k` is less than the path length.

### Evaluation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that the program correctly calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha.
- The logic for determining the winner based on the scores is sound and correctly implemented.
- The use of the `vis` array ensures that positions are not revisited, preventing infinite loops.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program and the annotated code, it is clear that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. The program handles all edge cases and performs the necessary calculations accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
