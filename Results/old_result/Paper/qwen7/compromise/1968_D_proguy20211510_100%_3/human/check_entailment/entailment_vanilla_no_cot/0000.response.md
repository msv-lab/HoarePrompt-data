Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variables `YES` and `NO` are defined but not used in the logic. These should be removed.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The `MOD` variable is defined but not used in the logic. This can be removed.
3. **Character Variable**: The `alpha` variable is defined but not used in the logic. This can be removed.
4. **Logic for Paths**: The logic for generating the paths for Bodya and Sasha is correct, but it can be optimized.
5. **Scoring Calculation**: The scoring calculation logic is mostly correct, but there are some potential issues with how the scores are accumulated and compared.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Function to calculate the maximum score for a given starting position
        def calculate_max_score(start):
            path = []
            visited = [0] * n
            current = start - 1
            while not visited[current]:
                path.append(a[current])
                visited[current] = 1
                current = p[current] - 1
            return sum(path[:k])
        
        # Calculate the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha
        resb = calculate_max_score(pb)
        ress = calculate_max_score(ps)
        
        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version removes unnecessary variables and simplifies the logic for calculating the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha.
