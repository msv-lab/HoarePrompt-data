Output State: **`i` is `len(paths) + 2`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `k`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of an implicit context. Therefore, the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
