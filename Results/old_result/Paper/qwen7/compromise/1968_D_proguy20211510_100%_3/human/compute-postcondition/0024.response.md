Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]` and then `a[pb - 1]` again, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The code `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `pathb`. Since `pathb` was previously containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]`, now it will contain these elements followed by another instance of `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
