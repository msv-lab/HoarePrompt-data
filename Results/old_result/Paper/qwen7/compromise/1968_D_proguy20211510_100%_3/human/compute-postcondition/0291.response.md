Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i-1] + pathb[i]`, `curr` is unchanged, `resb` is the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[i-1] * (k - (i-1))`.**

Explanation: The code updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[i-1] * (k - (i-1))`. The values of `i`, `preb`, `curr`, and `resb` are updated according to their previous definitions. `i` is incremented by 1, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i-1] + pathb[i]`, `curr` remains unchanged, and `resb` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[i-1] * (k - (i-1))`.
