Based on the given initial state and the print statement, let's break down the situation:

1. **`i`**: This is equal to the total number of elements in the `paths` list.
2. **`curr`**: This holds the value of `pres` plus the last element of `paths` multiplied by the difference between `k` and the index of the last element.
3. **`pres`**: This is the sum of all elements in the `paths` list.
4. **`ress`**: This contains the maximum value between its initial value and the calculated `curr` value for each iteration.
5. **`resb`**: This is less than or equal to `ress`.
6. **`ress`**: This is greater than `resb`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
