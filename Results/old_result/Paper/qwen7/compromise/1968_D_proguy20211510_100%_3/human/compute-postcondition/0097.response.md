Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is less than 5, and `curr` is `pres` + `paths[4]` * (`k` - 4)**

This means that the variable `curr` is now calculated as the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[4]` and the difference between `k` and 4. The values of `i` and the condition on `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
