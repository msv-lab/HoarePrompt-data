Output State: **`i` is `len(paths) + 2`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i-1] * k`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `curr`, and `pres`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
