Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the loop or if statement it is within. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
