Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is less than 4, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[3]` * (`k` - 3), `pres` is increased by `paths[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `pres += paths[i]` increments the value of `pres` by `paths[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `pres` is increased by `paths[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
