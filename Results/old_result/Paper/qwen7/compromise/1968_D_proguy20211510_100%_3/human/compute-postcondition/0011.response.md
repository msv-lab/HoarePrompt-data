Since the `while True` loop runs indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time. The loop will always proceed because it is a `while True` loop.

State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is the converted integer value of the third split value from input, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, where `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `vis[pb - 1] = 1`**
