Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i-1]`, `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i-1] * (k - (i-1))`, `resb` is the maximum of its current value and `curr`, and if `k < i` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code updates `curr` to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, so the term `pathb[i]` becomes `pathb[i-1]`. Thus, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i-1]`. The value of `curr` is then set to `preb + pathb[i-1] * (k - (i-1))`. The value of `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `curr`. The condition `k < i + 1` is checked, and if true, the loop or if statement is broken.
