The only variable in the loop head is the condition itself, which is `True`. Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute as long as there are no explicit conditions to break out of the loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
