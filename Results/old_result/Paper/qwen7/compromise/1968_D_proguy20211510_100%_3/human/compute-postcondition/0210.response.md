Output State: `i` is `len(paths)`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * k`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `paths`, since the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of `paths`. The variable `k` remains an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`. The `curr` variable will be the value of `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * k`, where `pres` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `paths` as each element is added in the loop. Finally, `ress` will hold the maximum value between its initial value and any `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations.
