Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(paths)` is known, `k` is 1, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the last valid `curr` value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the condition `k < i + 1` was true before the `break` statement, the loop or conditional block has been exited. All other variables retain their original values as no changes were made to them within the scope of the `break` statement.
