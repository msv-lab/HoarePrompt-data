Output State: **`i` is 2, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[2]` * (k - 2), `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres` + `paths[0]` + `paths[1]` + `paths[2]`.**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates the value of `ress` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. The other variables (`i`, `curr`, `pres`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
