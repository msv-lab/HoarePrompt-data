Output State: **`i` is 0; `curr` is `pres` + `paths[0]` * (`k` - 0); `pres` is `pres` + `paths[0]`**

Explanation: The code `pres += paths[i]` increments the value of `pres` by `paths[i]`. Given that `i` is 0 initially, `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[0]`. The values of `curr` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
