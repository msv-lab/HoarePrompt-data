Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is the converted integer value of the third split value from input, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, where `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are updated to be the first, second, third, and fourth elements of the list `a`, respectively. The list `p` is then updated to contain these values.
