Output State: **`i` is 2, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[2]` * (k - 2), `pres` is `pres` + `paths[0]` + `paths[1]` + `paths[2]`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is increased by `paths[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `pres += paths[i]` increments the value of `pres` by `paths[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[2]`. The other variables (`curr`, `pres`, `ress`) are not directly affected by this line of code, but their values are mentioned for completeness.
