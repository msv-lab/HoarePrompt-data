Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `preb` is equal to `preb` + `pathb[i]`; `curr` remains unchanged; `resb` is the maximum of its current value and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. The other variables (`i`, `preb`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
