Output State: **`monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `zip` object of `positions` and `healths` based on the absolute value of the positions. The sorting is done in-place, meaning the original lists `positions` and `healths` are combined into a list of tuples and then sorted. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `healths`, and `positions`) remain unchanged.
