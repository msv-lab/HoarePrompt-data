Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n`, `position` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `health` is a list of integers converted from the input, `distance` is the absolute value of the position from the tuple in the `monsters` list at index `i`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, and `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`.**

Explanation: The code `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`. Since `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `total_bullets_used` is updated to its current value plus the health of the current monster. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
