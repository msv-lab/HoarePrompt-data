Output State: **`success` remains False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`**

Explanation: The line `bullets_needed = health` simply reassigns the value of `health` to `bullets_needed`. Since `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` now holds that value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
