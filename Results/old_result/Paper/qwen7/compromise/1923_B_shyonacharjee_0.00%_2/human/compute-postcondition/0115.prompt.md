Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is True, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `healths` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` remains less than `n`, `n` must still be greater than 0, `position` remains the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` remains the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` remains `abs(position)`, `time_available` remains equal to `distance`, and `bullets_needed` remains `health`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, and `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
