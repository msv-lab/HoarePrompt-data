Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `health` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `time_available = distance` updates the value of `time_available` to be equal to the current value of `distance`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
