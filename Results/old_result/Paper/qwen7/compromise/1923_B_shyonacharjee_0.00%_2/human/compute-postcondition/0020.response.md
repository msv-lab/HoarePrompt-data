Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `health` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance` of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` from the previous iteration, `distance` is updated to the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of the `distance` variable to the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
