Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, and `bullets_needed` remains `health`.**

This means that the `time_available` variable is now set to the value of `distance`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
