Output State: **`success` is True, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n`, `position` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `health` is a list of integers converted from the input, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` are undefined, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `success = True` sets the variable `success` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
