Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` remains False, `i` is 1.**

The code `m = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `m`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
