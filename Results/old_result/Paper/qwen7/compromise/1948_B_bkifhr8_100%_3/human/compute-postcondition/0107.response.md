Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` remains False, `i` is -1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will eventually reach -1 because the loop starts from `m-1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. If the loop completes all iterations without finding any pair of elements in `arr` that violate the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` will still be False. The value of `m` will be 0 since the loop processes each element in `arr` exactly once. The variable `i` will be -1 after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has finished processing all elements.
