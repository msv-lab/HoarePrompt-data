Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `nums` which contains two elements: the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and the element `arr[i]`.
- The value of `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The new list `nums` is created based on the conditions specified in the code.
