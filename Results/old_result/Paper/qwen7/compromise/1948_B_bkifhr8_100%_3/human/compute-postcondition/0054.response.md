Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not modify any variable's value but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the context, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
