Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and the element `arr[i]`**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `m`, `arr`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
