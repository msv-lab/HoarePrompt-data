Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is False, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
