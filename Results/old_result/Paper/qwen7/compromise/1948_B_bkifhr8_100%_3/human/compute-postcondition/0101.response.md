Output State: **`ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of the list `nums`. Since `nums` contains the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now set to the last digit of `arr[i-1]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
