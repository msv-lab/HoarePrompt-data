Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `nums` is not equal to the sorted version of `nums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. None of the other variables (`i`, `nums`, `arr`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
