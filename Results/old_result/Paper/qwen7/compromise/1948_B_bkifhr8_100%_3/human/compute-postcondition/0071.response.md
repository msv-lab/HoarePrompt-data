The only objects in the loop head are variables `n`, so we can only adjust `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and starts from a value greater than 0).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is less than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each element has been processed according to the conditions inside the loop, `ans` is False, `i` is 0, `nums` is no longer defined as it is only used within the loop.**
