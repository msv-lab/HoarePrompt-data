Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` shifted by one and the current element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the string representation of the element at index `i-1` in `arr` to integers and concatenating it with the element at index `i` in `arr`.
- Since `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` will contain the integer representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.
