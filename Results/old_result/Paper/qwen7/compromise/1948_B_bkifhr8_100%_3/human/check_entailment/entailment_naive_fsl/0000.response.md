Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and attempts to split the previous element to see if sorting is possible. However, the logic for splitting and checking is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```

- The initial array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- When comparing `67` and `45`, the program checks if `[45, 67]` can be sorted, which is true, but it doesn't update the array correctly.
- The correct approach would be to check if the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

The provided solution does not handle the correct logic for determining if the array can be sorted after applying the operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
