Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even or odd and returns 'yes' or 'no' based on that condition. However, the problem requires more complex logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

For example:
- A \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
- A \(2 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle.

The current implementation only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient for determining if a new rectangle can be formed. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
