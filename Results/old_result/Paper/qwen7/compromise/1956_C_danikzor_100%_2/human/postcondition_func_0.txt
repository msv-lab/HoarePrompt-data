The function processes a single test case defined by an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \)). It calculates and prints the value of \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) followed by \( 2 \times n \). Subsequently, for each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive), it prints two lines: the first starting with 1 and the second with 2, each followed by \( i \) and the numbers from \( n \) down to 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the specified outputs.
