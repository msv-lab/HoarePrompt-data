Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, which calculates the maximum possible sum and the required number of operations.
   - The formula \(n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1) / 6\) is used to calculate the maximum sum, which seems to be a misinterpretation of the problem's requirements.
   - The solution prints \(2n\) operations, each of which permutes the elements of a row or column in descending order.
3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \(n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1) / 6\) does not seem to correctly represent the maximum sum achievable by the given operations. The correct maximum sum for an \(n \times n\) matrix where each element is set to its position in the permutation (i.e., \(a_{i,j} = \min(i, j)\)) is actually \(n^2\).
   - The operations performed (permuting rows and columns in descending order) do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum. Instead, setting each element to its position in the permutation (i.e., \(a_{i,j} = \min(i, j)\)) would achieve the maximum sum.
4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
