The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \) along with a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then sorts the list \( a \) in descending order. The function compares the \( k \)-th largest element in the sorted list with the element at index \( f \). Based on the comparison, it prints either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case. If the \( k \)-th largest element is greater than the element at index \( f \), it prints 'NO'. If the \( k \)-th largest element is less than the element at index \( f \), it prints 'YES'. If they are equal, it checks if the \( k \)-th element is the last element in the list; if so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.
