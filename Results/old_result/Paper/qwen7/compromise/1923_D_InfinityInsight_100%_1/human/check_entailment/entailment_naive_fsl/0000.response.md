Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be directly related to solving the problem as described.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
5
2 2 3 1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 1 2 1 -1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 1 2 1 2
```

In this example, the output is incorrect for the fifth slime. According to the problem description, the fifth slime should be impossible to eat (`-1`), but the program incorrectly outputs `2`.

The program seems to be attempting to use binary search and cumulative sums, but these are not appropriate for solving the given problem. The correct approach would involve tracking the positions and sizes of the slimes and simulating the eating process to determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or determine if it is impossible.
