Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` is 4 - `inx2`, `i` is 4, `a` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 4, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx2` is the value of `last[2]`, and `ans[4]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans[i] = 1` changes the value of `ans[4]` to 1, since `i` is 4. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
