Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is `n-1`; `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `x` to be `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `left` and `a`, the expression `left[i] - a[i] - 1` is used to represent the new value of `x`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
