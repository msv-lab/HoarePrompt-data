The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of `n` non-negative integers, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The function returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[2]` is 1, `ans[3]` is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` is 1. Additionally, the function sets `i` to 0, initializes `left` as the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element, and updates `last` to contain `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`. The original list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` with specific values at indices 2, 3, and 4, sets `i` to 0, initializes `left` as the cumulative sum of `a`, and updates `last` to contain `-1` repeated. The original list `a` and integer `n` remain unchanged.**
