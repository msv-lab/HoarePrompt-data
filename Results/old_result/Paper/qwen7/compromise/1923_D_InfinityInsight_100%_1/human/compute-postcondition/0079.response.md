Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is `n-1`; `inx` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given context, the `continue` statement does not change any variables or affect the state of the program. Therefore, all the previous conditions and values remain unchanged.
