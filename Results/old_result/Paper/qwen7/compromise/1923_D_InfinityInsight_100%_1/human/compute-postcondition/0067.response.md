Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `ans[i]` is updated to `i + 1 - inx` for each `i` in the list.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `ans` such that for each index `i`, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`. However, since the initial conditions specify that `ans[2]` is 1, `ans[3]` is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` is 1, these specific values remain unchanged. The other elements of the list are updated according to the given formula. The value of `inx` remains as specified in the initial conditions, and `inx2` also remains as specified.
