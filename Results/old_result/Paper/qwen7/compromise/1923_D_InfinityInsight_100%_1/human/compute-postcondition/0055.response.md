Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` is 4 - `inx2`, `i` is 4, `a` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 4, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx2` is the value of `last[2]`, and `ans[4]` is 1, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
