Output State: `left` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 0 (since `i` will be set to 0 after the loop ends), `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i` for each iteration.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to 0 since it starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `left` list will contain the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element because the loop appends the sum of the last element of `left` and the current element `i` in each iteration. The `last` list will still contain `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`, and `ans` will remain a list of length `n` filled with -1.
