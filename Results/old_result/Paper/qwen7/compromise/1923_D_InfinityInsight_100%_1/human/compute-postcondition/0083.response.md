Output State: `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is 0; `inx` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to 0 since it starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `ans` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, but no further updates occur once `i` reaches 0. Therefore, `ans` will retain its last known values, and `i` will be 0. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, `x`, `inx`, and `inx2`) will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.
