Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2.
   - `last` is a list containing -1 and -1.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 5 (since the loop starts from 1).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1 and -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 1**
