Postcondition: `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` is 4 - `inx2`, and `ans[4]` is 1. If `a[4] < a[3]`, then `ans[4]` remains 1. If `a[4] >= a[3]`, then `ans[4]` remains 1 as well. The other elements of the list `ans` and the variables `i`, `a`, `n`, `x`, and `inx2` remain unchanged.
