Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer from user input; `b` is the second integer from user input; `adj[a]` now contains `b`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are integers obtained from user input, the list `adj[a]` is updated to include `b`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged, and the values of `a` and `b` are kept as they were from the user input.
