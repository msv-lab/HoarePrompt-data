Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: 
- The value of `L` is updated to the value of `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`.
- The values of `numCuts`, `leftover`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `leftover` is still the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` was originally `(L + R) // 2`.
