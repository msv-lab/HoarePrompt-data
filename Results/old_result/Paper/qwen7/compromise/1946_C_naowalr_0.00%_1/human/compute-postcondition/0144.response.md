Output State: `L` is 33334, `R` is 33335, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 33334, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to narrow down the range between `L` and `R` until the difference between them is no longer greater than 1. After each iteration, `x` is calculated as the midpoint of the current range, and based on the conditions provided, `L` or `R` is updated accordingly. After multiple iterations, the final range will be from 33334 to 33335. Since `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the iterations and does not meet the condition to update `R`, the final value of `R` will be the midpoint rounded down, and `L` will be the midpoint rounded up. Therefore, the final values are `L` as 33334 and `R` as 33335.
