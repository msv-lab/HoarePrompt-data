Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first number from the second input.
   - `b` is the second number from the second input.
   - `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, a]`.
   - `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains the same as the initial value (first number inputted).

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` is still the first number inputted.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same.
   - `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain the same as they were not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 2, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, a]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`**
