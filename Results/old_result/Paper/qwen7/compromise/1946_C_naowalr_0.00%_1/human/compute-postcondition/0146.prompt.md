Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from stdin, representing the number of test cases; n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 for each test case; adj is a list of lists where adj[i] contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex i.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is a value between 1 and `R` (inclusive), where `R` is 100001, and `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` after the loop terminates.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `L` will be adjusted such that it is always less than or equal to `R`, and the value of `x` will be the midpoint of the current range `[L, R]`. The variable `numCuts` and `leftover` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, as they are not reassigned within the loop body. Since the loop condition `R - L > 1` eventually becomes false, indicating that `L` and `R` are as close as possible given the precision of integer division, `R` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `L`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is the final value of `L` after the loop, `R` is the final value of `R` after the loop, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the values of `L` and `R` will converge to the same value, as the loop continues to narrow down the range until `R - L` is no longer greater than 1. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 because it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration of the loop and is not modified within the loop body. The variable `leftover` will hold the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is made once per loop iteration and does not change between iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `L` is 33334, `R` is 33335, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 33334, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to narrow down the range between `L` and `R` until the difference between them is no longer greater than 1. After each iteration, `x` is calculated as the midpoint of the current range, and based on the conditions provided, `L` or `R` is updated accordingly. After multiple iterations, the final range will be from 33334 to 33335. Since `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the iterations and does not meet the condition to update `R`, the final value of `R` will be the midpoint rounded down, and `L` will be the midpoint rounded up. Therefore, the final values are `L` as 33334 and `R` as 33335.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
