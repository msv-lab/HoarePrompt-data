Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is the final value of `L` after the loop, `R` is the final value of `R` after the loop, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `n` is an integer obtained from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, `k` is an integer obtained from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, `z` is `t`, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `adj` as a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each element is an empty list. This does not affect the values of `numCuts`, `L`, `R`, `leftover`, `n`, `k`, or `z`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
