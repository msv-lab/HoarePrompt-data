Output State: **`L` is 1**

The initial state indicates that all integers `a` and `b` are correctly added to their respective adjacency lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]`, and the variable `i` equals `n - 2`. The given code snippet simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `L`. No other variables are affected, so the only change is that `L` is now `1`.
