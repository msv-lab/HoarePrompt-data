Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 0, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `a` to `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[b]`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain both `b` and `a`, making it `[b, a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
