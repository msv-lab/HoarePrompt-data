Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 50002, `numCuts` is greater than `k`, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is 25001.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Given that `L` is 50001 and `R` is 50002, the expression `(L + R)` equals `100003`. The integer division of `100003` by `2` results in `50001`. Therefore, `x` is updated to `25001`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
