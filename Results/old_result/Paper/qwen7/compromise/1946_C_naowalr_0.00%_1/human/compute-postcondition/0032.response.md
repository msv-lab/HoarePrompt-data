Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to the variable `x`. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions for `L` and `R` also remain valid as they were not affected by the code.
