Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is the final value of `L` after the loop, `R` is the final value of `R` after the loop, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `n` is an integer obtained from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, `k` is an integer obtained from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, and `z` is `t`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and then converts them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. This means `n` and `k` are now integer values, but no changes are made to the other variables (`numCuts`, `L`, `R`, `leftover`, and `z`).
