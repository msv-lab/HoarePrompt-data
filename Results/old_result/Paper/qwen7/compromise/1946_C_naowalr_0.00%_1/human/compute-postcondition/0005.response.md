Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 0, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these strings into integers. These two integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
