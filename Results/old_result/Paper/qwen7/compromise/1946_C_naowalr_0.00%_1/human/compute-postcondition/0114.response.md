Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, `adj[b]` now contains `a` and includes the appended value `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n - 1`, two integers `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into a list and converted to integers, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to it, `adj[b]` now contains `a` twice.**

Explanation: The line `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Since `adj[b]` already contained `a` before this operation, after appending, `adj[b]` will contain `a` twice. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
