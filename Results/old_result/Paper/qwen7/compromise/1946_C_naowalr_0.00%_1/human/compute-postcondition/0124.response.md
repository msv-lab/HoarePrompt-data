Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than k, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)` or (`numCuts` is equal to k and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001)**

Explanation: The code `L = x` assigns the value of `x` (which is 50001) to `L`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `L` is now 50001, while `R`, `numCuts`, `x`, and the condition for `leftover` remain as they were in the initial state.
