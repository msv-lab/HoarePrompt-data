Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is the final value of `L` after the loop, `R` is the final value of `R` after the loop, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `n` is an integer obtained from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, `k` is an integer obtained from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, `z` is `t`, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj[a].append(b)
    adj[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted; `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted; `adj[b]` now contains `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, `adj[b]` now contains `a` and includes the appended value `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n - 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, `adj[b]` now contains `a` and includes the appended value `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n - 1`, two integers `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into a list and converted to integers, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to it, `adj[b]` now contains `a` twice.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
