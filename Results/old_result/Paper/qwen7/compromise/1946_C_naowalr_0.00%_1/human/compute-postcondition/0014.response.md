Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 2, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, a, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[b, b, a]`. After appending `b`, `adj[a]` becomes `[b, b, a, b]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `adj[b]` remain unchanged.
