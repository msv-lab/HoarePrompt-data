Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `k` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, and we read two integers from the standard input separated by space; adj is a list of lists with length n + 1, where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code creates a list of lists named `adj`. This list contains `n + 1` elements, each initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the input process of reading two integers from the standard input has been completed.
