Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from user input; `b` is an integer from user input; `adj[b]` contains `a` appended to it; `i` is `n - 1`**.

This means that the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain as per the initial state, but now `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers input by the user. The list `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a` appended to it.
