Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, `adj[b]` now contains `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This means `a` and `b` now contain the values of the first and second numbers inputted respectively. The value of `adj[b]` is updated to contain `a`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, only that it must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes while keeping the unchanged conditions intact.
