Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is `(L + R) // 2**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` to `R`. Since `x` is defined as `(L + R) // 2`, `R` now holds the same value as `x`. All other variables (`numCuts`, `leftover`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
