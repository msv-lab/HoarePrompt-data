Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `n` remains an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is now `n-2`, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `a`, and `adj[b]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `b`; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001.**

The code initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged from their initial states.
