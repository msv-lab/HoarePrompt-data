You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, `n` is the original length of `a`, `a` is the original list of `n` non-negative integers, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` after the bitwise operation, and its value is the difference between the number of times it appears in `a` and the number of times its counterpart (after the bitwise operation) appears. If a key does not appear in `count`, it means its counterpart appeared more times, and its value will be negative. If a key appears in `count`, it means it appeared more times than its counterpart, and its value will be positive or zero.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in list `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). After applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element in the list `a`, the function returns the count of unique elements in the modified list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of unique elements in list `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
