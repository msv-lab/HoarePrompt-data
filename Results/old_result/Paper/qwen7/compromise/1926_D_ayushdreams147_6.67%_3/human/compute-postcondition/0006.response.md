Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). After applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element in the list `a`, the function returns the count of unique elements in the modified list.**
