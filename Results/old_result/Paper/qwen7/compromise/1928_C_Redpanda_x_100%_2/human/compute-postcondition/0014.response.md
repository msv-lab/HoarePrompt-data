Output State: **`prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime`, `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded, `factors[prime]` is at least 1, `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. This means that `factor * prime_to_i` is produced as output. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `factor * prime_to_i` has now been yielded.
