Output State: **`factor` is the next element in `rest` after `prime`, `prime_to_i` is `factor * prime_to_i`, `rest` remains as it was initially**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` calculates the product of `factor` and `prime_to_i` and yields it. Since `prime_to_i` is defined as `2 * prime`, the new value of `prime_to_i` becomes `factor * (2 * prime)`. The values of `factor` and `rest` remain unchanged.
