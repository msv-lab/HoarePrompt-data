You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: 'No'
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and either `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` or `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) and checks if \( (n - m) \) is non-negative and even. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop that runs `kreker` times.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented. This is problematic because the function is called inside the for loop without any implementation.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Now, let's evaluate the correctness of the logic:

- The logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is correct. The key points are:
  - Each move either adds 1 cube or removes 1 cube.
  - Therefore, the difference between the final number of cubes and the initial number of cubes (`n - m`) must be even (since every addition and removal cancels out in pairs).
  - Additionally, `n - m` must be non-negative (since you cannot have a negative number of moves).

Given this analysis, the logic in `func_1()` is correct. However, the program fails because it calls `func_1()` without defining its body.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to define the function `func_1()` properly:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    def func_1():
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
    func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
Since the logic in `func_1()` is correct but the function needs to be defined before being called, the original program is **incorrect** due to the missing function definition.

Correctness: **False**
