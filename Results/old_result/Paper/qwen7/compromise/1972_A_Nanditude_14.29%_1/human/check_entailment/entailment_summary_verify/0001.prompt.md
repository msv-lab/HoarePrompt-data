You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list containing two lists. The first list consists of `n` non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of initial problems, and the second list consists of `n` non-decreasing integers representing the maximum expected difficulties. After executing the function, it returns a new list of two lists, where both lists contain the original integers in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have two arrays `a` and `b` of length `n`, where `a` represents the current difficulties of the problems and `b` represents the maximum expected difficulties.
- We need to find the minimum number of new problems to propose such that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.
- When a new problem with difficulty `w` is proposed, the most difficult problem (last element of `a`) is removed, and `a` is re-sorted.

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `cnt` is initialized to count the number of new problems needed.
   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are used to iterate through `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The loop runs until either `i` or `j` reaches the end of their respective arrays.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current difficulty in `a` is greater than the expected difficulty in `b`. In this case:
     - Remove the last element of `a` (most difficult problem).
     - Insert `b[j]` into `a` at the appropriate position to maintain non-decreasing order.
     - Increment `cnt` and `j`.
   - Otherwise, move both `i` and `j` forward since `a[i]` is already less than or equal to `b[j]`.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the count of new problems needed for each test case.

### Verification:
- The logic correctly handles the condition where `a[i] > b[j]` by removing the most difficult problem and inserting the expected difficulty.
- The insertion of `b[j]` into the correct position ensures that `a` remains sorted.
- The removal of the last element and re-sorting (though not explicitly done in the code) is implicitly handled by the slicing and concatenation operations.

### Edge Cases:
- The program should handle cases where `a` and `b` are already sorted and meet the conditions without needing any new problems.
- It should also handle cases where `a` has elements greater than corresponding `b` values, requiring the insertion of new problems.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately counts the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.
