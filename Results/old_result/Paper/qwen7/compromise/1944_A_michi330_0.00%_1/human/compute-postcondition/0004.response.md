Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2) as part of its input through a test case structure where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. It returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.**
