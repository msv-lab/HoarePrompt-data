Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed, where each integer is half of the corresponding input integer \(x\) for each test case. Specifically, if there are \(t\) test cases, the output will be a list of \(t\) integers, each being the result of \(x_i // 2\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(t\).
