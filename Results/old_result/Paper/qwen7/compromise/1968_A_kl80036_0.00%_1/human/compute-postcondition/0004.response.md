Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \(x\) (with \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\)) and prints half of \(x\) (\(x // 2\)). After processing all test cases, it outputs a list of integers, each being half of the corresponding input integer \(x\).**
