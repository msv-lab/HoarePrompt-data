The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low <= high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low <= high` must be true. Given that `low` is 0, `high` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `n` is a positive integer and `b` is a positive integer, the minimum of `n` and `b` is also a positive integer and thus greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `high` because it is already guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `low` (which is 0) due to being a positive integer. The state right before the loop is already sufficient for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`max_profit` is 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`**
