Output State: t is the number of test cases initially given, each test case processes an integer n between 1 and 50. For each n:
- If n is odd, prints "NO".
- If n is even and less than 400, prints "YES" followed by a string 'AAB' repeated (n//2) times, but the string length does not exceed 200 characters. If n is even but the resulting string would be 200 or more characters long, prints "NO".
