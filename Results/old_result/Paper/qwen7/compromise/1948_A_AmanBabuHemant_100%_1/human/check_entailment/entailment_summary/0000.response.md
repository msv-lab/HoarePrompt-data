Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the input by processing each test case individually.
- It checks if \( n \) is odd or even, which is a necessary condition for constructing a string with exactly \( n \) special characters.
- For even \( n \), the program constructs a string using 'AAB' repeated \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. This ensures that every 'B' in the string will have exactly one neighbor that is different from it, making it a special character.
- The program also checks if the constructed string length is within the limit of 200 characters, which is a valid constraint.
- However, the program does not handle the case when \( n = 1 \) correctly. When \( n = 1 \), the program incorrectly prints "NO" because \( n \) is odd, but a string like "A" would be a valid solution since it has no neighbors and thus all conditions are met.

Correctness: **False**

The program should handle the case when \( n = 1 \) by printing "YES" and "A" instead of "NO".
