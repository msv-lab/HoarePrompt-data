Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `True`. All other variables retain their initial states.
