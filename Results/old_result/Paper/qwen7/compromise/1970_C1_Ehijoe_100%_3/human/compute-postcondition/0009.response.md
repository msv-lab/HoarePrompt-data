Output State: `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers determined by user input for each iteration, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is a list of pairs (u, v) representing edges in a graph, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the key is an integer node and the value is a list of integers representing connected nodes, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connection.

In this output state, the variable `ends` contains all the nodes that have only one connection (i.e., nodes with a degree of 1) after the loop has executed all its iterations. The other variables remain in their initial states or are not affected by the loop.
