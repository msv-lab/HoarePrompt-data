Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
