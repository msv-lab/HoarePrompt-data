### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summaries against the problem description.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring shifted.

#### Given Code:
- `func_1` and `func_2` are defined, but they do not correctly implement the solution.
- `func_1` reads a list of integers from input, which is incorrect since the input should be a binary string.
- `func_1` counts the number of '1's in the string and adds the count plus one to `ans` for each '0' encountered. This logic does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts or the goal of sorting the string.

#### Function Summaries:
- `func_2` processes a specified number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` does not return any value but computes the count of '1's in the string.

Given these observations, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem. They do not handle the cyclic shifts or compute the minimum total cost required to sort the string.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the boundaries between segments of '0's and '1's in the string. Each segment of '1's can be moved to the beginning of the string with the cost being the length of the segment. The total cost would be the sum of the lengths of these segments.

Here is a corrected approach:
1. Identify the boundaries between '0's and '1's.
2. Calculate the cost for each segment of '1's by moving them to the beginning of the string.

#### Example:
For the input `101011`:
- Segments: `1`, `0`, `101`, `11`
- Costs: `1`, `1`, `3`, `2`
- Total cost: `1 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 7`

However, the provided functions do not implement this logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
