Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the problem as described. Specifically, they treat the input as a list of integers instead of a binary string, and their logic does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts or the goal of sorting the string.

For example, consider the input `101011`. The correct output should be `9`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided functions will not produce this result because they do not correctly calculate the cost of cyclic shifts or sort the string.
