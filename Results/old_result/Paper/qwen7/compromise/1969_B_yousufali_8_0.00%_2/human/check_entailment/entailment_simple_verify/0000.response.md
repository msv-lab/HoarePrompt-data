### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input as a list of integers, which is incorrect. The problem specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. For example, the input `101011` should be read as a string, not as a list of integers.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` does not match the problem requirements. The program attempts to count the segments of consecutive 1's and adds the length of each segment to the answer. This approach is incorrect because:
   - It does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts.
   - It does not ensure that the string is sorted in non-descending order.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input `101011`. The program would incorrectly process this as a list of integers `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
   - The program would then count segments of consecutive 1's and add their lengths to the answer, resulting in `3 + 3 + 2 = 8`, which is incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the positions of the first 0 and the last 1 in each segment of 1's and 0's.
   - We need to calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move these segments to their correct positions.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
