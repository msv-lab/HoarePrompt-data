### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` reads an input that is expected to be a list of integers but should actually be a single binary string.
   - The function converts the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which splits the input into individual elements and converts them to integers. This is incorrect for a binary string input, as it expects a space-separated list of integers, not a binary string.
   - The function then iterates through the list and counts the number of 1s and 0s. However, the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the string is not implemented.
   - The function prints `ans`, which is the sum of all segments of consecutive 1s in the list plus the length of each segment. This is not the correct approach for solving the problem.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also be incorrect.

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - The program should read a binary string and calculate the minimum cost to sort it using cyclic shifts.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the binary string input and does not implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost.

5. **Annotations Analysis:**
   - The annotations provided do not reflect the actual behavior of the functions. They suggest that `func_1` is counting segments of consecutive 1s, which is not the correct approach for solving the problem.
   - The annotations for `func_2` indicate that it processes test cases but does not provide any output or verify the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the binary string input and does not implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts. The current implementation is flawed and does not solve the problem as intended.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
