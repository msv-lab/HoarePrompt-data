### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process a binary string and calculate the minimum cost to sort it.
   - However, the function currently reads a list of integers from input, which is incorrect. The input should be a single binary string.
   - The logic inside the function is trying to count segments of consecutive 1s and add their lengths to the answer. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also be incorrect.

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - The program should read a binary string and calculate the minimum cost to sort it using cyclic shifts.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the binary string input and does not compute the correct cost.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify the positions where the string needs to be shifted to sort it.
   - For each segment of 0s followed by 1s, the cost is the length of the segment.
   - The total cost is the sum of the lengths of these segments.

6. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We should iterate through the string and whenever we encounter a '0' after a sequence of '1's, we should add the length of that sequence to the cost.
   - This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the binary string input and does not compute the correct cost. The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the current implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly process the binary string and compute the minimum cost to sort it using cyclic shifts.
