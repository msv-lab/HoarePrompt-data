Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even and prints the corresponding player as the winner without considering the optimal strategy for the game. According to the game rules, the player who ends up with zero coins in their wallet loses. However, the program incorrectly determines the winner based solely on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

For example, consider the test case `1 4`. Based on the game rules, if Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 4 coins, the game would proceed as follows:

1. Alice can either swap wallets or keep them. If she keeps them, she will remove 1 coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 4 coins.
2. Bob can then either swap or keep. If he keeps, he will remove 1 coin, leaving him with 3 coins and Alice with 0 coins.
3. This process continues until one of them is left with 0 coins.

The program, however, incorrectly determines that Bob wins because `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. This is not a valid strategy for determining the winner based on the game rules. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and should be considered incorrect.
