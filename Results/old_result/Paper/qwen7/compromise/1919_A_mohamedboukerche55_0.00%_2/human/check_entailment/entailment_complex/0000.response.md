Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd.
2. The provided solution iterates over each test case, reads the values of `a` and `b`, and then checks if their sum is even or odd.
3. If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".
4. This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for the game:
   - If the sum of the coins is even, Bob can always force the game into a state where the sum is odd, ensuring he wins.
   - If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice can always force the game into a state where the sum is even, ensuring she wins.
5. The provided code correctly implements this logic for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
