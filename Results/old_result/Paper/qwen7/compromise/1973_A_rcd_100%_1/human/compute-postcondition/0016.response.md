Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the postconditions and preconditions remain the same, and we simply note that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
