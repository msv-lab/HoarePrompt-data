Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` is either 0 or 1.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
   - `y` is at least 1 if `x` is 1.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement to be executed is `print(p1 - x + p3)`.

Now, let's analyze the expression `p1 - x + p3`:

- If `x` is 0:
  - The expression simplifies to `p1 - 0 + p3`, which is `p1 + p3`.

- If `x` is 1:
  - The expression simplifies to `p1 - 1 + p3`, which is `p1 + p3 - 1`.

Given that `y` is at least 1 if `x` is 1, this condition does not affect the calculation of the expression directly but confirms that `x` can only be 0 or 1.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `x`:

- If `x` is 0, the output will be `p1 + p3`.
- If `x` is 1, the output will be `p1 + p3 - 1`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we need to consider both possibilities.

Output: **p1 + p3 - x (where x is either 0 or 1)**
