Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `y >= x`.

2. **Current states before the loop**:
   - `x` is 0.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `y >= x`.
   - Given that `x` is 0, the loop will execute if `y > 0`.
   - Since `y` is equal to `p3`, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `p3` could be any positive integer as long as it is less than `p1 + p2`.

4. **Check the current state of `y` (which is `p3`)**:
   - We know `p3` is an integer and less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, but we do not have specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Therefore, `p3` could be any positive integer.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes the first time, `p3` (which is `y`) must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is `y` (or `p3`), ensuring it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is 0, `t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `y` (which is `p3`) must be greater than 0**.
