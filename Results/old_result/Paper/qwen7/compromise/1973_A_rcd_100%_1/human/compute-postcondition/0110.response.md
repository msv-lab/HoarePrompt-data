Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the constraints provided for t, p_1, p_2, and p_3. For each test case, if t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 500, and p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, the function processes these values but does not explicitly return a specific value from the function body description given.**

Note: The actual return value is not specified in the provided output cases, so the functionality focuses on the constraints and input parameters described.
