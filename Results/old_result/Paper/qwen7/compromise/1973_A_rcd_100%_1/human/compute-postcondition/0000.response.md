Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), after executing the code, `t` will still be within this range, but its specific value will depend on the user's input. All other variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`) remain unchanged and still satisfy the conditions \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). However, since no changes are made to these variables in the given code, they are not included in the updated state.
