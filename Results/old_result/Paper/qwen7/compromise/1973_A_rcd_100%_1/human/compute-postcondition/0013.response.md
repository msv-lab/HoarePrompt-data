Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `p1 - x` is less than or equal to the current value of `p2 - y`.
