Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is decreased by 1 and `x` is set to 1.
