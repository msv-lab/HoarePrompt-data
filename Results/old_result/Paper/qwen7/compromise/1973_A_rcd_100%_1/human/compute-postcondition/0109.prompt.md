Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = p3
        while y >= x:
            if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                print(p1 - x + p3)
                break
            else:
                x += 1
                y -= 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Additionally, after all iterations of the loop, `x` will be either 0 or 1, and `y` will be equal to `p3`. The loop will continue until either the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, in which case it will print `p1 - x + p3` and break, or until `y` becomes less than `x`, in which case it will print `p3`. If the condition is never met, `p3` will be printed after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, we continue the loop. If `p3` is not less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is 1 if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, otherwise `y` is 0, and `t` remains greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop. If the sum is even, `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` is at most -2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
