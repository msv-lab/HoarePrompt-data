Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, and the condition that `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2` still holds true. The program continues the loop, so we indicate that we are continuing the loop in the output state.
