Postcondition: **`x` is either 0 or 1, `t` is greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, and `p3` is greater than 0. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1, and `y` is set to `p2 - 1`.**
