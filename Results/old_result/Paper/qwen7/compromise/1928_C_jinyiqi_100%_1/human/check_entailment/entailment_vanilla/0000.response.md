Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received for each test case.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even.
     - If `(n + x - 2)` is even, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` to find all divisors of `(n + x - 2)`.
     - If `(n - x)` is even, it calls `func_1(n - x)` to find all divisors of `(n - x)`.

3. **Filtering Divisors:**
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.

4. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.

5. **Printing Result:**
   - The length of the `output` list is printed, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that the total number of positions considered is even, which aligns with the problem statement where the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - Similarly, `(n - x) % 2 == 0` ensures that the starting point is correctly aligned with the settling pattern.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(x)` correctly calculates all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - The logic in the main loop to filter valid `k` values is also correct.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The filtering logic ensures that only those `k` values are considered which satisfy the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
