Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `output1` is a list containing 1 element which is `i`, `output2` is a list containing 1 element which is `int(x / i)`, if `x % i == 0`. Otherwise, `i` remains 2, `n` remains unchanged, and both `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.
