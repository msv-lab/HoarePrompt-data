Output State: **The loop will continue to iterate as long as \(i\) (which starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than or equal to the square root of \(x\). After all iterations, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` in ascending order, and `output2` will contain the corresponding quotients in descending order.**

To elaborate, once the loop finishes all its iterations, `output1` will include every integer \(d\) such that \(1 < d \leq \sqrt{x}\) and \(x\) is divisible by \(d\). Similarly, `output2` will include the corresponding quotient \(\frac{x}{d}\) for each divisor \(d\) found in `output1`. The values of `x` and `n` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
