Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing 2 elements `[3, 3]`, `output2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `output1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `output1`. Since `output1` initially contains one element `[i]` (i.e., `[3]`), after appending `i` again, `output1` becomes `[3, 3]`. The values of `x`, `i`, `n`, and `output2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
