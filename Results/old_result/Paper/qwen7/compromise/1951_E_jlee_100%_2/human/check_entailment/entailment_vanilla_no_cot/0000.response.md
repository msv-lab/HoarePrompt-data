Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies single-character strings as non-palindromic and outputs "NO". However, it should output "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

2. **General Partition Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings is flawed. The program tries to find a single non-palindromic substring, which is not always possible. It should check for multiple partitions if necessary.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the string has repeating characters or when the string length is even and all characters are the same.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(substring):
    return substring == substring[::-1]

def can_partition_non_palindromic(s):
    n = len(s)
    if n <= 1:
        return False, None
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
            return True, [s[:i], s[i:]]
    return False, None

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input().strip()
        n = len(string)
        if n == 1:
            print("NO")
            continue
        can_partition, partition = can_partition_non_palindromic(string)
        if can_partition:
            print("YES")
            print(len(partition))
            print(" ".join(partition))
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version checks for a valid partition by trying to split the string at every possible position and ensuring neither part is a palindrome. If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" along with the number of parts and the partition itself. If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".
