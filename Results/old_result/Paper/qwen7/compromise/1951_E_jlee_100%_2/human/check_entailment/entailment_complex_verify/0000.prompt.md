You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: All input strings have been processed, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `t` is the original input integer, `i` ranges from `0` to `t-1`, `string` is the input string for each iteration, `s` is the list representation of `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is `True` if a valid condition was met for the string, otherwise it remains `False`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` and `count2` are integers that track specific conditions during the loop, and `j` is the last index checked in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions and prints one of three possible outputs: "YES" followed by the number of operations needed to transform the string into a palindrome, or "NO" if no transformation can achieve the required condition. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify partitions for strings that require more than two non-palindromic substrings. 

Consider the following test case:
```
input:
3
aba
abc
abcd
```

The expected output for `aba` would be:
```
YES
2
ab a
```

However, the current implementation only checks for partitions of length 1 or 2. It does not consider partitions of length greater than 2, which is necessary for strings like `aba`.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle partitions of length greater than 2. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        # Check if the entire string is a palindrome
        if string == string[::-1]:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to find a partition of length 2
        for j in range(1, n):
            if string[:j] != string[j:][::-1] and string[j:] != string[:n-j][::-1]:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                break
        else:
            # If no partition of length 2 works, check for longer partitions
            print('YES')
            print(n)
            print(*[string[i:i+1] for i in range(n)], sep='')
```

This revised version checks for partitions of length 2 first and then handles longer partitions if necessary. This ensures that the program can correctly identify partitions for all test cases.
