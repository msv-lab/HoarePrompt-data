Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is defined as `count + 1`
- `n` is greater than 0

However, there is no explicit value or definition for the `string` variable in the initial state. Since `string` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine its value.

Therefore, the output of the `print(string)` statement will be an attempt to print an undefined variable.

Output: **string (where string is an undefined variable)**
