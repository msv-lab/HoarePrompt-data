Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`, and `count` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `count2`. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, then `count` is 2; otherwise, `count2` is reset to 0.
