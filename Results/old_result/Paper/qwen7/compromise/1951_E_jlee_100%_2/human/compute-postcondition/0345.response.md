Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `count + 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to `True` and the loop is broken out of. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, no changes are made to `done`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Let's break down the components:

1. **`string[:j - 1]`**: This slice of the string `string` includes characters from the start up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
2. **`string[j - 1:]`**: This slice of the string `string` includes characters starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

Given that `j` is `count + 1`, and assuming `count` is a non-negative integer, `j` would be a valid index for the string `string`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `string` or `count`, we need to consider the general case where the string is symmetric around the center (as implied by the condition checking for symmetry).

Thus, the print statement will output two parts of the string: the part before the middle character and the part after the middle character.

Output: **string[:count], string[count:]**
