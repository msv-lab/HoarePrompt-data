Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and either the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, in which case `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, and `done` remains unchanged.
