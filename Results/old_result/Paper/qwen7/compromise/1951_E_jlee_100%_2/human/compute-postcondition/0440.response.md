Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is `j` and its current value is greater than `0`, `count2` is `0`, `n` must be greater than `0`, and the condition `count2 == count` is true. The condition `count > 1` is false.
