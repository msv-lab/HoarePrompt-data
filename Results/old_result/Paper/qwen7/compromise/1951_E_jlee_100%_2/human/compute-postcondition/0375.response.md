Output State: **`done` is `True`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the list `s`, which is the length of the input string. This length is stored in the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
