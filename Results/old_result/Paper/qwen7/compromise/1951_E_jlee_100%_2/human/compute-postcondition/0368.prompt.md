Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is equal to `n-1`, `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is `t`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, and the condition `s.count(x) == n` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`; `done` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is equal to `j`. If `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count`. If `count` is not greater than 0, `count2` is equal to `1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, `done` is `True`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. This holds true regardless of whether `count2` is less than, equal to, or greater than `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is `count + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `done` is True if either `count > 1` and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, or `count2` is greater than `count` and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count` is equal to `j` or `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains unchanged and the loop continues. If `count2` is not greater than `count` and `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains unchanged and the loop continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
