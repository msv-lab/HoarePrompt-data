Output State: **`j` is `count + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is equal to `j`, `done` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `j` to `count`. This means `count` now holds the same value as `j`. The conditions for `n` and `done` remain unchanged from the initial state since they are not affected by the assignment operation.
