Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`

The code snippet simply prints the number 1. Since no variables or objects need to be evaluated or described further, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1**
