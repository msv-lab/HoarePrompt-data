Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list representation of the input string
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count` is `j` and its current value is greater than `0`
- `count2` is `0`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`
- The current value of `count2` is greater than `count`

The print statement is simply printing the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
