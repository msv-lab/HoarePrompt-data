Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, `count2` is `0`, `n` must be greater than `0`, and if at any point `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is not set to `True`. If `count2 == count` and `count > 1`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` becomes `True`. If neither condition is met, the loop continues with the same conditions.
