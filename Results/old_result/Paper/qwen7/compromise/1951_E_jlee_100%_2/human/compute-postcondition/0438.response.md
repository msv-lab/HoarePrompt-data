Output State: **`done` is set to `True`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is `j` and its current value is greater than `1`, `count2` is `0`, `n` must be greater than `0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables listed in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the loop or if statement we were inside. All other variables retain their initial values.
