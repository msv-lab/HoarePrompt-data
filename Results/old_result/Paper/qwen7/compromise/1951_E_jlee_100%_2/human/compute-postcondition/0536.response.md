To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `done` is `True`.
   - `count` is equal to `j`.
   - The function checks if the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.

2. **Condition for Loop Continuation**:
   - If the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, the function sets `done` to `True` and exits the loop.
   - If the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, the function continues the loop or iteration with `count` remaining unchanged.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given the above conditions, the print statement will execute only after the loop has exited because `done` is set to `True`. This implies that the characters from index `j` to `n-1-j` were found to be unequal, and thus, the loop has completed its execution.

4. **Values of Variables**:
   - `string[:j]`: This is the substring of `s` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j`.
   - `string[j:]`: This is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output these two substrings separated by a space.

Output: **string[:j] string[j:]**
