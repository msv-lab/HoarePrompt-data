Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`. The condition `done` equals `True` holds true.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is executed, it means we are breaking out of the loop or conditional block we are currently inside. However, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables outside of that block. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `count`, `s[j]`, `x`, and the condition `done` remain unchanged.
