Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `done` is True if `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`
- `count` is 1

We need to evaluate the `print` statement:

```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Given that `j` is 1, let's break down the slicing operations:

1. `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:1 - 1]` which is `string[:0]`. This results in an empty string `""`.

2. `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[1 - 1:]` which is `string[0:]`. This results in the entire string `string`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Output: **'', string**
