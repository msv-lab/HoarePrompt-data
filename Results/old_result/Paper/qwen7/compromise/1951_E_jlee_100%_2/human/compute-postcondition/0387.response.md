Output State: **`done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s` is still valid, but since no loop is present, the condition itself does not get evaluated. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
