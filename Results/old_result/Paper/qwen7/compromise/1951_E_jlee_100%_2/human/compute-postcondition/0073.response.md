Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`.
- The condition `count2` equals `count` holds true, and `count` is greater than 1.

We need to evaluate the `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])` statement.

1. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` becomes -1.
2. In Python, slicing with a negative start index from the beginning of the string results in an empty string (`""`).
3. Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` will be `""`.

For `string[j - 1:]`:
- `j - 1` again is -1, but since slicing with a negative end index from the end of the string also results in an empty string (`""`), `string[j - 1:]` will also be `""`.

Thus, both parts of the string slice result in empty strings.

Output: **'', ''**
