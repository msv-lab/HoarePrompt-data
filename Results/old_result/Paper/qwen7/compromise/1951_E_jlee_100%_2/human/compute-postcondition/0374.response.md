Output State: **`done` is `True`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string.**

The code `s = list(string)` converts the input string into a list of characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `done` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
