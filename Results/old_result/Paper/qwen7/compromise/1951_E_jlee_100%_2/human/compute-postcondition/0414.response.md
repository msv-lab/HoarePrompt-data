The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, `count` is `j`, `count2` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and if at any point `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.**
