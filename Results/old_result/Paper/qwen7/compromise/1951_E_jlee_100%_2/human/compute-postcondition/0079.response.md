Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` equals `count`, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`. If `count` is greater than 1, then the condition `done` equals `True` holds true. Otherwise, `count2` is 0, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`.
