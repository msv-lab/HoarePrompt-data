Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`, and `count` is 1.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
