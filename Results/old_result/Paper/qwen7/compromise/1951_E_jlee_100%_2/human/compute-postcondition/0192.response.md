Output State: **`j` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `t`, `string` is an input string**

The code `string = input()` assigns the value entered by the user through the input prompt to the variable `string`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
