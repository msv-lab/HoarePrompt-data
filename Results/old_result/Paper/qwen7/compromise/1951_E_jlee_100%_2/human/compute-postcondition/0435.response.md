Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list representation of the input string
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count` is `j` and its current value is greater than `1`
- `count2` is `0`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- If at any point `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is not set to `True`
- The condition `count2 == count` is true

The print statement is simply `print(2)`. This means it will print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
