Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it simply indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional block we were inside. None of the variables are affected by this statement, so their values remain unchanged.
