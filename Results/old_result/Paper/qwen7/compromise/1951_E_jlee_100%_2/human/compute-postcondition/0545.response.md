Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is `count2 + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `count2` is incremented by 1. The values of `done` and `count` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `done` is still `True` and `count` is still equal to `j`. The new value of `count2` is `count2 + 1`.
