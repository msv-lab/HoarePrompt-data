Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and is the number of test cases. Each test case will contain three integers n, x, and y, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. Additionally, the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The first line of each test case contains these three integers n, x, and y. The second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = n - list0[-1]
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `list0` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `count` is equal to the number of times `num` equals 1 for consecutive elements in `list0` plus 1, `i` is `x-2`, `num` is 1, `n` is `list0[-1] + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the if-else block executes, `i` will be `x - 1`, `num` will be `n - list0[-1]`, and `count` will be the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution. If `num` equals 1, `count` is incremented by 1 and `num` remains 1; otherwise, `num` is updated to `n - list0[-1]` and `count` does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x - 1`, `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution plus 1, `T` is `T - (x - 1)`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]` equals 1, and `list0` is sorted.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
