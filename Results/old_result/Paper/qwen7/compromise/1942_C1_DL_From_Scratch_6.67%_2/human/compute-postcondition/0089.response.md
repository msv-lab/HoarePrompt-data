Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), followed by \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive integers in the list and adds the number of such gaps to the count of test cases minus one. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.**
