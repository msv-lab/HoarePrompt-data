Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: `num_tests` is an input integer, and the value of `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
3. **Determine what needs adjustment**: For the loop to execute at least once, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Given that `num_tests` is an input integer and the current state does not specify any particular value for `num_tests`, we need to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Since no specific value for `num_tests` is given, we can only adjust the condition to ensure it meets the requirement of being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**
