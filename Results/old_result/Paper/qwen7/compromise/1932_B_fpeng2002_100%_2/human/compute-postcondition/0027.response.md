Output State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i]` for each `i` from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_tests` remains 0 because it was not modified within the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it is an input parameter not altered by the loop. The list `nums` remains the same as it was initially provided. The variable `x` will be equal to the length of `nums` since the loop increments `x` until it reaches the length of `nums`. The variable `start_year` will be the final value obtained after applying the given formula to each element in `nums` sequentially.
