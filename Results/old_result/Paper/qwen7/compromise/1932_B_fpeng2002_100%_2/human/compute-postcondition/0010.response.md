Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
   - `start_year` is calculated as `nums[1] * ((nums[1] + nums[1] - 1) // nums[1] + 1)`.
   - `x` is 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for x in range(0, len(nums)):
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Current State of `x`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `x` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `start_year` are not affected by the loop head and remain the same.

7. **Updated States:**
   - `num_tests` remains greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0.
   - `n` remains the same input integer.
   - `nums` remains a list of integers with at least 1 element.
   - `start_year` remains the same value.
   - `x` is now 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `nums[1] * ((nums[1] + nums[1] - 1) // nums[1] + 1)`, `x` is 2**
