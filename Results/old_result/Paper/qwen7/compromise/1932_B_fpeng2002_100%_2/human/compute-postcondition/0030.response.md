The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `num_tests` is 0. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `num_tests` must be adjusted to a value greater than 0.

The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `x`) do not affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i]` for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1.**
