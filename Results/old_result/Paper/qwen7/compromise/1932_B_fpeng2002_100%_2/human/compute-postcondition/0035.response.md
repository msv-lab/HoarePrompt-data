Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` and the expression `range(0, len(nums))`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `x`**: The loop will start with `x` being 0 because the range function starts from 0 by default.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than the length of `nums`.

4. **Adjust the required states**: Based on the loop head, the only variables that need adjustment are `x` and `nums`. We need to ensure that `x` starts at 0 and that `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element (since the loop requires `len(nums)` to be greater than 0).

Given the initial state:
- `num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer
- `x` is equal to the length of `nums`
- `start_year` is 0

We need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, `x` should be set to 0, and `nums` should be a non-empty list.

State: **`x` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element**
