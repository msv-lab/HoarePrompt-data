Output State: `x` is equal to the length of `nums`; `start_year` is the result of applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for every index `x` from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the length of the list `nums`. The value of `start_year` will be the final result of repeatedly applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the list `nums`, starting from the initial value of `start_year` which is 0.
