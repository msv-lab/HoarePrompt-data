Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces; `start_year` is 0.**

The code initializes `start_year` to 0. This does not affect the values of `num_tests`, `n`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
