Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `num_tests` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (though its specific value is not relevant for this particular print statement).
   - `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `x` is the length of `nums`.
   - `start_year` is calculated by applying the formula `(start_year // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i]` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `x-1`, starting with `start_year` initialized to 0.

2. **Formula Explanation**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, the formula `(start_year // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i]` is applied.
   - Initially, `start_year` is 0.
   - For the first iteration, `start_year // nums[0] + 1` results in 1 because `0 // nums[0] + 1 = 1`.
   - Therefore, `start_year` becomes `1 * nums[0]`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - In the next iteration, `start_year` becomes `1 * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1` * `nums[1]`.
   - This process continues until all elements in `nums` are processed.

4. **Final Value of `start_year`**:
   - Since `start_year` starts at 0 and is updated in each iteration by the formula, the final value of `start_year` will be the product of all elements in `nums` after the formula is applied iteratively.

Given that `nums` is a list with at least one element, let's denote the elements of `nums` as `a0, a1, a2, ..., ax-1`.

The final value of `start_year` will be:
\[ \text{start\_year} = (1 \cdot a0) \cdot (1 \cdot a1) \cdot (1 \cdot a2) \cdots (1 \cdot ax-1) = a0 \cdot a1 \cdot a2 \cdots ax-1 \]

Therefore, the print statement will output the product of all elements in the `nums` list.

Output: **the product of all elements in the `nums` list**
