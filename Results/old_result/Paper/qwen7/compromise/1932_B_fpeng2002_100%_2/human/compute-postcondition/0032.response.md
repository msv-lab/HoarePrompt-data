Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i]` for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `num_tests`, `nums`, `x`, or `start_year`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
