You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates a value `start_year` by iteratively applying the formula `(start_year // a_i + 1) * a_i` for each element `a_i` in the list, starting with `start_year` initialized to 0. After processing all test cases, it prints the final `start_year` value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`nums`).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to keep track of the current year when the last sign occurred.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates over each sign.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.

4. **Update Logic:**
   - The update logic `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
   - This logic is correct because:
     - `(start_year // nums[x])` gives the largest integer less than or equal to `start_year / nums[x]`.
     - Adding 1 to this quotient and multiplying back by `nums[x]` gives the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs, the final value of `start_year` is printed, which should be the year when all signs occur sequentially.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `6 3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - First sign (3): `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Second sign (2): `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign (4): `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign (5): `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign (9): `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign (18): `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: 36

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `5 1 2 3 4 5`
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - First sign (1): `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - Second sign (2): `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - Third sign (3): `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Fourth sign (4): `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - Fifth sign (5): `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: 5

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `5 1 1 1 1 1`
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - Each sign (1): `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`, `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`, etc., up to `start_year = 5`.
  - Output: 5

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `6 50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - First sign (50): `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - Second sign (30): `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
  - Third sign (711): `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - Fourth sign (200): `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
  - Fifth sign (503): `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - Sixth sign (1006): `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: 2012
