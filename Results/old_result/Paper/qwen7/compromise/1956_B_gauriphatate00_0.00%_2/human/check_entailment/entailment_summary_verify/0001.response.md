### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the logic implemented in the functions. However, let's break down the analysis further to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Key Points to Verify

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - You and Nene each have n cards.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Strategy for Nene:**
   - Nene will place cards on the table to block your points whenever possible.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Counts the number of pairs of cards in your hand.
   - Returns the minimum of the number of pairs and half the number of your cards.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound:
     - `Counter(a)` counts the occurrences of each card in your hand.
     - `sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))` counts the number of pairs.
     - `min(pairs, n // 2)` ensures that the result is the minimum of the number of pairs and half the number of your cards.
   - This aligns with the optimal strategy for Nene, as she will place cards on the table to block your points.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.
   - The logic for reading and processing the input is correct.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Nene will always place cards on the table to block your points.
   - If you have a card `x`, Nene will place a card `x` on the table if possible.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum number of points you can get by considering the number of pairs and the optimal blocking strategy.
