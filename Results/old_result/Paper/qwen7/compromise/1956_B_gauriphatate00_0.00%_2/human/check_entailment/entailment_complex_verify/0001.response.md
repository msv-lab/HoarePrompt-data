### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the logic implemented in the functions. However, let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - You and Nene each have n cards initially.
   - Nene will try to prevent you from scoring points by placing cards on the table when you select a new card.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - You and Nene each have n cards initially.
   - Nene will prioritize placing cards on the table to block your points.

3. **Strategy for Nene:**
   - Nene will place a card `x` on the table if you select a card `x` to prevent you from scoring.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum of the number of pairs of cards and half the number of your cards.
   - `Counter(a)` counts the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - `sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))` counts the number of pairs (i.e., cards that appear twice).
   - `min(pairs, n // 2)` returns the minimum of the number of pairs and half the number of your cards.
     - If you have more than `n // 2` pairs, Nene can place one pair on the table for each of your pairs, preventing you from scoring any points.
     - If you have fewer than `n // 2` pairs, Nene can still block some of your points by strategically placing cards.

5. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the total number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of cards `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the result and prints it.

### Verification

- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The logic in `func_1` is correct because:
    - If you have `pairs` of cards, Nene can place one of those pairs on the table, preventing you from scoring any points.
    - If you have fewer than `n // 2` pairs, Nene can still block some of your points by strategically placing cards.
  - The function correctly returns the minimum of the number of pairs and half the number of your cards, which aligns with the optimal strategy for Nene.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
