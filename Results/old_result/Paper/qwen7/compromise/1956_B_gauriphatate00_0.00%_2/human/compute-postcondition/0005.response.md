Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, `a` is a list of n integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `idx`, `t`, `data`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, and `results` is now an empty list.
