Output State: **idx is 2 + t * (1 + n), t is an input integer, data is a list of strings, n is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, a is a list of n integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand for each iteration, results is a list of outputs from func_1(n, a) for each iteration.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `idx` starts at 2 and increases by 1 + n for each iteration of the loop (`1` for the line `n = int(data[idx])` and `n` for the line `idx += n`). Therefore, after `t` iterations, `idx` will be `2 + t * (1 + n)`.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is used only to determine the number of iterations.
- The variable `data` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` is set to an integer value inside the loop but is not stored anywhere; its value changes with each iteration.
- The variable `a` is reset to a new list of integers for each iteration based on the current value of `n`.
- The variable `results` accumulates the outputs from `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.
