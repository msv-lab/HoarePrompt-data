Postcondition: `counter` is 3 if the character at position `i` (which is `len(num) - 2`) in `num` is '0'. Otherwise, `counter` is 2 if the character at position `i` (which is `len(num) - 2`) in `num` is '0', and `counter` remains 1 otherwise; `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\); `i` is `len(num) - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
