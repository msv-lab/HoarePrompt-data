Output State: **`counter` is 0, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The code initializes `counter` to 0. The value of `num` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it. Therefore, `num` still holds its initial condition of being an integer within the range 1 to \(10^9\).
