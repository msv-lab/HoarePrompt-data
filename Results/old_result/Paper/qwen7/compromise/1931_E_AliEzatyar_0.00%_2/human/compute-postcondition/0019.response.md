Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `counter` will hold the total count of '0' digits from the end of `num` until the first non-zero digit is encountered, `num` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), and `i` will be the index where the loop breaks, which is the position right after the last '0' digit or 0 if `num` consists entirely of '0's.**

In simpler terms, `counter` will count how many trailing zeros `num` has, and `i` will point to the index just after the last zero or will be 0 if there are no zeros at the end.
