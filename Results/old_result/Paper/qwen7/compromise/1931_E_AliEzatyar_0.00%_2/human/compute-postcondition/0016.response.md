Output State: **`counter` is 2 if the character at position `i` (which is `len(num) - 2`) in `num` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 1; `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\); `i` is `len(num) - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the values of `counter`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
