Postcondition: **`no` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is the input string from the user, `counter` is equal to the length of `c`, `c` is a non-empty string, and the last character of `c` is `x`. If any character in `c` is not found in either `a` or `b`, the function outputs these states.**
