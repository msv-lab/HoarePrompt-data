Postcondition: `no` is False, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is the input string from the user, and `counter` is equal to the length of `c`. This means that after executing the if-else block, `c` is a non-empty string where every character in `c` was found in either `a` or `b`, and the loop has checked all characters in `c`.
