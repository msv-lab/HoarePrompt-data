Postcondition: `no` remains False, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the new input string that must have at least one character, `counter` is 3, and either `x` is not in the current element of `a` at index `counter` and `x` is not in the current element of `b` at index `counter`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
