Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in c`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `c`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `counter` is incremented by 1 (this is not part of the loop head, so it does not affect the loop execution).
   - `c` is a non-empty string.
   - `x` is the first character of `c`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement remains intact (this is not part of the loop head, so it does not affect the loop execution).

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute again**:
   - For the loop `for x in c` to execute again, `c` must still be a non-empty string.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is set to the first character of `c` at the start of each iteration, `x` will change with each iteration but `c` remains the same as long as it is non-empty.
   - Therefore, `c` must remain a non-empty string for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`c` is a non-empty string**
