Based on the initial state provided:

- `counter` is incremented by 1.
- `no` is initially `False`.
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `x` is not found in both `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`.
- `x` is the next value in the list `c`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects whose values need to be described in this case, as the print statement does not depend on any variable values but rather just prints a fixed string.

Output: **YES**
