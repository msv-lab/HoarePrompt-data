Postcondition: **`no` remains False, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the new input string that must have at least two characters, `counter` is 2, and `x` is not in the current element of `a` at index `counter` or `x` is not in the current element of `b` at index `counter`. If the condition `x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
