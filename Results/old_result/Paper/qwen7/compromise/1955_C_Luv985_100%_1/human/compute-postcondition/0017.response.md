Output State: **`a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[1]` is `a[1]`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` decrements the value of `a[r]` by `mi`. The other variables remain unchanged. `a[r]` was originally `a[r]`, and now it is `a[r] - mi`. All other conditions and values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
