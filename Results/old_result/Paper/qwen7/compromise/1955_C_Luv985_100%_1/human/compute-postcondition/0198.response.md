Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `ans` is 1, `t` is `k % 2`.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
