Output State: **`a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[1]` is `a[1]`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, and `a[l]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was set to 0. After executing the code, `l` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
