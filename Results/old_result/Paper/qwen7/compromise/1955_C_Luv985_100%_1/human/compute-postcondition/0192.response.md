Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `l` is 1, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `ans` is 2, `a[r]` is 0, and the condition `l == r` is now false.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
