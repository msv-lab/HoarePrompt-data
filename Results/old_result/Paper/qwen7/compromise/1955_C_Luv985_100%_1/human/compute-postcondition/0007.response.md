Output State: **`T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n` is an integer converted from the first word of the input split by space; `k` is an integer converted from the second word of the input split by space; `a` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the first word of the input converted to an integer and the second element is the second word of the input converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` takes the input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The first element of `a` is the first word of the input converted to an integer, which is assigned to `n`, and the second element of `a` is the second word of the input converted to an integer, which is assigned to `k`. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
