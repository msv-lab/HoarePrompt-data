Output State: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n` must be at least 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list containing two elements, both elements are integers, the first element is the first word of the input converted to an integer and the second element is the second word of the input converted to an integer; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `mi` is assigned the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, `a[l]` is the first element of the list `a` and `a[r]` is the second element of the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
