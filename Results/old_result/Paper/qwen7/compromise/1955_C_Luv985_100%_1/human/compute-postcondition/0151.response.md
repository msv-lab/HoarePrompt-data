Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1 plus 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 3` or `n - 2`, `k` is `k - (min(a[l], a[r]) * 2)`, `l` is `l + 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2` if the condition is false, `a[r - 1]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` was initially `n - 2` or `n - 1`, after decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 3` or `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
