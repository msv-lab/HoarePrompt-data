Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of ships. It also includes two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) for each of the t test cases, where n is the number of ships and k is a threshold value. Additionally, a list of n positive integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) is provided, representing the durability of each ship. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing the number of ships, a threshold value, and a list of ship durabilities. It then calculates and returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.
