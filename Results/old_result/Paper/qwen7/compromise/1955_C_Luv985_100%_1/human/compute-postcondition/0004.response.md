Output State: **`T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n` is the first word of the input split by space; `k` is the second word of the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code splits the input by space into two parts and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it was not involved in any operation.
