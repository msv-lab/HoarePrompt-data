Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is less than `r`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is defined as the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
