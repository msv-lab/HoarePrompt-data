Output State: **`T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n` is an integer converted from the first word of the input split by space; `k` is an integer converted from the second word of the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code snippet `k = int(k)` converts the second word of the input, which was previously stored in `k` as a string, into an integer. The first word of the input is already stored in `n` as an integer, and the value of `T` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
