Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`.**

The code `t = k % 2` assigns the value of `k % 2` to the variable `t`. Since the initial value of `k` is greater than 0, `k % 2` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd. However, without knowing the exact value of `k`, we cannot specify the exact value of `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
