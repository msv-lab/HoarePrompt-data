Postcondition: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-2`, `ans` is 2, `t` is `k % 2`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if else block executes.**
