Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each value in `N`. For each value of `num`, the following conditions are checked:
   - If `num > cur`, then `M[cur]` is set to 1, `num` becomes the new `cur`, and the loop may break or continue based on the condition `num > cur + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is the next value from `N`.
   - `cur` and `M` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the next value from `N`, it will be the starting value for the next iteration.
   - `cur` and `M` will remain unchanged unless the loop breaks or continues based on the conditions inside the loop.

Given the loop head involves only the variable `num`, we need to update `num` to the next value from `N`.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `num` will be the next value from `N`.
- `cur` and `M` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` and `M` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration**.
