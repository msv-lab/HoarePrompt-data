Output State: **`cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `N` that was greater than `cur` at some point during the loop, and the value for each such key is 1. For any `num` in `N` that was not greater than `cur`, the value in `M` is 2. `cnt` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = []` initializes an empty list named `cnt`. This does not affect the values of `cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`, or `M`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
