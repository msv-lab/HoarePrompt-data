Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an input integer minus 1, `S` is an input integer plus an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input split, `M` is a dictionary with all keys that were greater than `cur` at some point during the loop having a value of 1, all other keys having a value of 2, and the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, with `cnt` containing all the keys from `M` that had a value of 1.**

Explanation: The line `cur = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
