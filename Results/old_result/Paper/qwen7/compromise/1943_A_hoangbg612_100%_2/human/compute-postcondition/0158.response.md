Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for num in N:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `N`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is the second element of `N`.
   - `cur` is equal to `num`.
   - If `num > cur`, then `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand what happens in the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the second element of `N`, in the next iteration, `num` will be the third element of `N`.
   - `cur` will be updated to this new value of `num`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `num` will be the third element of `N`.
   - `cur` will be the third element of `N` (since it gets updated to the new value of `num`).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new state should reflect that `num` is now the third element of `N` and `cur` is the third element of `N`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`num` is the third element of `N`, and `cur` is equal to `num`**.
