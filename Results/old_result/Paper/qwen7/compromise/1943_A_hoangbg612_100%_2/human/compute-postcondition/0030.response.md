Output State: **`cur` is the next element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 1**.

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `M`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
