Output State: **`num` is the third element of `N`, and `cur` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Since `num` is the third element of `N`, `cur` now holds the same value as `num`. The condition `if num > cur + 1` is not relevant here because `cur` is immediately set to `num`, making the comparison redundant. Therefore, the output state reflects that `num` remains the third element of `N`, and `cur` is now equal to `num`.
