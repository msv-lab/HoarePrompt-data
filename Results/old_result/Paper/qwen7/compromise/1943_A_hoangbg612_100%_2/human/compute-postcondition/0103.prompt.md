Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is -1, `T` is an input integer minus 1, `S` is an input integer plus an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input split, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` contains all the keys from `M` that had a value of 1, and the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num` is an integer, `cur` is an integer, and if `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` and `M` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration. If `num > cur`, then `M[cur]` is set to 1, `num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` remains as it was updated in the previous iteration, and `M[cur]` is either 1 (if `num` was greater than `cur` and we broke out of the loop) or `M[cur] + 1` (if `num` was not greater than `cur`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
