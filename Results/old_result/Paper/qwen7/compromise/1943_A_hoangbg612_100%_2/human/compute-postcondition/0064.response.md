Output State: **`cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer minus 1, `S` is an input integer plus an input integer (S = int(input())), `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with all keys that were greater than `cur` at some point during the loop having a value of 1, all other keys having a value of 2, and the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, with `cnt` containing all the keys from `M` that had a value of 1.**

In this output state, the variable `S` has been updated to the value of the input integer provided by the user, which is the sum of the original value of `S` and the new input integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
