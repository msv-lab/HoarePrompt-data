Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, `cur` is equal to the last element of `N`, and `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in the list `N`. Additionally, if the sum of all values in the dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
