Output State: **`num` is assigned to `cur`, `N` must contain at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`; `M[cur]` is set to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been updated to 1, while the other variables retain their previous conditions and values as described in the initial state.
