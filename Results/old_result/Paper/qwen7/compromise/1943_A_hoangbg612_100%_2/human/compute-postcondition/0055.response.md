Output State: **`cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary that still has at least one key left to iterate over, `cnt` is a list with the key `k` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `cnt.append(k)` appends the key `k` to the list `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
