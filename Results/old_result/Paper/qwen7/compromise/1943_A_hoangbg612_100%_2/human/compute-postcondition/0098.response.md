Output State: **`num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` is `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The initial state mentions that `num` is the next value from `N`, and `cur` is increased by 1. After executing the code, `cur` is updated to the current value of `num`. The other conditions (breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement) remain unchanged.
