Output State: **`M[cur]` is incremented by 1, `num` is an integer, `cur` is an integer, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The values of `num` and `cur` remain unchanged, and the condition that `num` is less than or equal to `cur` still holds true.
