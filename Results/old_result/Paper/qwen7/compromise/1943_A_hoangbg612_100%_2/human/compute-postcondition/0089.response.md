Output State: **`M[cur]` is set to 1, `num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If the condition `num > cur + 1` is not met, the postcondition remains as the initial state where `num` is the next value from `N` and `cur` and `M` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration.**

This means that the value of `M[cur]` is now set to 1. The values of `num`, `cur`, and the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement remain as described in the initial state.
