To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `cur` is equal to the second element of `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(cur)
   ```

Given this information, we need to consider two cases for the value of `cur`:

- If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, then `cur` will be set to the second element of `cnt`.
- If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements, then `cur` will remain unchanged from whatever its previous value was.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `cnt`, we cannot determine the exact value of `cur` without additional information. However, based on the given conditions, `cur` will either be the second element of `cnt` if `cnt` has at least 2 elements, or it will retain its previous value if `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements.

Therefore, the output will depend on the actual value of `cnt`.

Output: **cur (where cur is the second element of cnt if len(cnt) >= 2, otherwise cur retains its previous value)**
