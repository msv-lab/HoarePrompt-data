Output State: **`cur` is the next element in the list `N` if it was not -1 and is increased by 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value `1` if `num > cur`, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `M`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `N` is a list of sorted integers and `M` is a dictionary with specific keys and values based on the comparison between `num` and `cur` remains valid.
