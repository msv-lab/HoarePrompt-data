Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `k` is the first key in the dictionary `M`.
- If `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the element `k`.
- If `M[k]` is not 1, then `cnt` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary `M` using the statement:
```python
for k in M.keys():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `M`.

2. **Determine the Next Key**:
   - Since `k` was the first key in the dictionary `M` at the end of the previous iteration, the next key in the iteration would be the second key in the dictionary `M`.

3. **Update the State**:
   - `k` will now be the second key in the dictionary `M`.
   - The value of `cnt` will depend on the value of `M[k]` (the second key). We need to consider both cases:
     - If `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` becomes a list containing the element `k`.
     - If `M[k]` is not 1, then `cnt` remains unchanged.

### Final State
Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`.
- `cnt` is either a list containing the second key if `M[k]` equals 1, or it remains unchanged if `M[k]` is not 1.

Thus, the final state is:
**`k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`, `cnt` is either a list containing the second key if `M[k]` equals 1, or it remains unchanged if `M[k]` is not 1.**
