Output State: **`T` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) and \(T > 0\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `N`. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged from their initial state.
