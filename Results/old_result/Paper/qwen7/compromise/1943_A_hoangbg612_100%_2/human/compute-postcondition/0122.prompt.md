Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is incremented by 1, and all values of `M[cur]` remain 1 unless `cur` was incremented and then the loop broke, in which case the corresponding `M[cur]` would be 1 and `cur` would be set to the next value in `N` that is greater than `cur + 1`. The variable `cur` will be the last value that satisfied `num > cur` and `num <= cur + 1` for all `num` in `N`. The sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`. `cnt` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is the first key in the dictionary `M`. If `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the element `k`. If `M[k]` is not 1, then `cnt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`, and `cnt` is a list containing the second key of `M`. If `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` remains unchanged. If `M[k]` does not equal 1, then `cnt` still contains the second key of `M`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is the third key in the dictionary `M`, and `cnt` is a list containing the second key of `M`. If `M[k]` equals 1, `cnt` is appended with the current key `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
