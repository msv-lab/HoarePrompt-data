Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game's final score based on the rules described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding MEX**:
   - The program attempts to find the second smallest unique number in the sorted list, which is not the correct approach for calculating the MEX.
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c`. The program does not construct the array `c` during the game and instead tries to infer the MEX directly from the sorted list `N`.

2. **Gameplay Simulation**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns appending elements to `c` and deleting elements from `a`, respectively. The program does not simulate these turns or construct the array `c` properly.
   - Instead, the program tries to find a pattern in the sorted list `N` to determine the MEX, which is not aligned with the game rules.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX, but the way `cur` is calculated is incorrect and does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and will produce incorrect results for most test cases.

Correctness: **False**
