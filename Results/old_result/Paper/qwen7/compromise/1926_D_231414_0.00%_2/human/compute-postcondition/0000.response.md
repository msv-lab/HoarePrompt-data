Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `times` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds an integer input from the user. The initial value of `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, but its specific value is not known and remains unchanged by this operation.
