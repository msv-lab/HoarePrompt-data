Output State: **`data` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer, `i` is the first element of the list `data`, `s` is the bitwise XOR of `i` and `check`, `dic[s]` is decremented by 1, `ans` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The first element of the list `data` is still assigned to `i`, the bitwise XOR of `i` and `check` is still assigned to `s`, and `dic[s]` is still decremented by 1.
