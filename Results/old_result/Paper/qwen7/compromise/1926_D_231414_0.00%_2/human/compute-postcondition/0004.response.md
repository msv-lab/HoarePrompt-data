Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `data`. The initial conditions for `times` and `n` remain unchanged.
