Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value of \(2^{31} - 1\), which is 2147483647. This does not affect the values of `times`, `n`, `data`, `dic`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
