Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; If `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` + 2, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` becomes `D[in_aa]` + 2; Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: 
- The line `C[out_aa] += 1` increments `C[out_aa]` by 1.
- The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
