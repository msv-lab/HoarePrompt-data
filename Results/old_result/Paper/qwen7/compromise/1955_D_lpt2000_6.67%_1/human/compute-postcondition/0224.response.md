Postcondition: `E[out_aa]` and `D[out_aa]` are integers. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is still decreased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` remain unchanged. In both cases, `E[out_aa]` is guaranteed to be decreased by 1.
