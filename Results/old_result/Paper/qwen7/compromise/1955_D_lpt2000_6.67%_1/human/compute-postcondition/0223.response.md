Postcondition: `E[out_aa]` is an integer, `D[out_aa]` is an integer, `C[out_aa]` is an integer. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged. `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, otherwise `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
