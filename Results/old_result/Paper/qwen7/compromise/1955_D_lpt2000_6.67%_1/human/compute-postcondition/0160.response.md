Output State: **`nabors` is decremented by 1; `aa` is a list of integers from the input split; `bb` is a list of integers from the input split; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the list `bb`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_bb = Counter(bb)` creates a `Counter` object named `cnt_bb` that contains the counts of each element in the list `bb`. The other variables (`nabors`, `aa`, `bb`, and `cnt_aa`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
