Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an input integer, and all other variables (t, n, m, k, a, b) retain their initial states.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All values in `D` are zero, `tot` is zero, `fnd` is incremented by 1 for every iteration where `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, `C` contains counts of elements in `aa[m:]` that were never in `bb` and their count in `C` is incremented by the number of such elements, `E` contains counts of elements in `aa[:n-m]` that were never in `bb` and their count in `E` is decremented by the number of such elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: All elements in `aa` have been processed, meaning `m` iterations have been completed since the loop starts processing elements from `aa[m:]`. The value of `fnd` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `tot` (the sum of `D.values()`) is greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `fnd` will be equal to the number of such iterations. `D` will contain the final counts of elements that were common between `aa[:m]` and `bb`, adjusted by the loop's operations. `C` will contain the counts of elements in `aa[m:]` that were not in `bb`, with these counts incremented based on the loop's logic. `E` will reflect the net changes in counts of elements in `aa[:n-m]` that were also in `bb`. `tot` will be the sum of the values in `D` after all iterations. `nabors` will be decremented by the number of iterations, and `aa` will be updated to a new list of integers as per the input provided.

In summary, after all iterations, `fnd` will be the total number of times `tot` reached or exceeded `k`, `D` will show the final common counts, `C` will show the counts of unique elements in `aa[m:]`, `E` will show the net changes in counts of common elements in `aa[:n-m]`, `tot` will be the sum of `D.values()`, and `nabors` will be decremented by the number of iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `fnd` will be incremented by 1 each time `tot` (the sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `tot` will be the sum of the remaining positive values in the Counter object `D`. All other variables (`C`, `E`, `aa`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`) will retain their final values after the last iteration of the loop. If `tot` never reaches `k` during any iteration, `fnd` will remain at its last incremented value.

In natural language: The final state of the loop will have `fnd` incremented each time `tot` meets or exceeds `k`, with `tot` being the sum of the remaining positive values in `D`. Other variables like `C`, `E`, `aa`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa` will hold their values after the last loop iteration, and `k` will remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
