Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split and converted to integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is either one less than its original value and still greater than 0, or it is decreased by 1 to become less than or equal to 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 after the if-else block executes. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` is adjusted as follows: if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, it is increased by 1 (and may also be increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]` or `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1). If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`; the values of `out_aa`, `in_aa`, `C[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, `C[in_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged +1, `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
