Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split and converted to integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`.**

Explanation: The code `E = cnt_aa - D` creates a new Counter object `E` which contains the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`. Here, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, so `E` will contain the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not present in both `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
