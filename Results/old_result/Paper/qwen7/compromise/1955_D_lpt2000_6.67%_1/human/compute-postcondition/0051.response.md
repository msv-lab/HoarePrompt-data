Output State: **`out_aa` is the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`; its value is either decreased by 1 (if `E[out_aa] > 0`), increased by 1 (if `E[out_aa] <= 0`), or decreased by 1 (if `D[out_aa] > 0`); `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is met; if the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is not met, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `in_aa` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions related to `out_aa` remain unchanged except for the fact that `C[out_aa]` has been incremented by 1.
