Output State: **`nabors` is decremented by 1; `aa` is a list of integers from the input split; `bb` is a list of integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `bb` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The original list `aa` remains unchanged, and `nabors` is decremented by 1. The output state includes the updated value of `nabors`, the unchanged list `aa`, and the newly created list `bb`.
