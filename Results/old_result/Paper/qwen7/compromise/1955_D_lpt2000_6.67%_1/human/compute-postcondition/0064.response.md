Postcondition: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`; the values of `out_aa` and `in_aa` remain unchanged. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.
