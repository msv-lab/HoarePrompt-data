Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, the values of `out_aa`, `in_aa`, `D[in_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `C[out_aa] += 1` increments the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1. The values of `D[out_aa]`, `fnd`, `tot`, `k`, `in_aa`, `E[out_aa]`, and `D[in_aa]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
