Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is an integer, `D[out_aa]` is an integer, `C[out_aa]` is an integer, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `E[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `E[in_aa]` by 1. According to the postconditions, if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, it would be decreased by 1. If not, `D[out_aa]` would be decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` would be increased by 1, in both cases, `E[out_aa]` would be decreased by 1. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `E[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]`, and the code only affects `E[in_aa]`, the output state includes the updated value of `E[in_aa]` and maintains the postconditions for `E[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]`.
