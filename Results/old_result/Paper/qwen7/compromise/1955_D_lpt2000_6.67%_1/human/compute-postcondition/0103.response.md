Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, `E[out_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` will have one of the following states:
- If `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is now greater than 0 - 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
- If `D[out_aa]` was less than or equal to 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.
