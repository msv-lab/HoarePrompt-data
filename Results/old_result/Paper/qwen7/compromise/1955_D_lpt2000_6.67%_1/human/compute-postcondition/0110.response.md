Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0 and not equal to `D[in_aa]`**.

This means that `D[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions on `D[out_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `C[in_aa]`, and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
