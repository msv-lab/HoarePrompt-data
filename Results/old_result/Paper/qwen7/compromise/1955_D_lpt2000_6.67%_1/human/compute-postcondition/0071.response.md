Postcondition: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`; the values of `out_aa`, `in_aa`, `C[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` remain unchanged. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, and either `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, or `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged. If `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, or `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.
