You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the coins.
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no more facing-up coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - Each test case consists of the number of coins `n` and a string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is odd, it prints "YES" indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it prints "NO" indicating Bob wins.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of counting the number of 'U' coins and determining the winner based on whether this count is odd or even is correct.
   - This approach works because:
     - If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice can always force the game into a state where the number of 'U' coins is even after her turn, ensuring she can always make a move.
     - If the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob can always force the game into a state where the number of 'U' coins is odd after his turn, ensuring he can always make a move.
   - The program correctly handles the input and outputs the result based on the given rules.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2, as it does not rely on the specific details of the string `s` beyond counting the 'U' coins.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
