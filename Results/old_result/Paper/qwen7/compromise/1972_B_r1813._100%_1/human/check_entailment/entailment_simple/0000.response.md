Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then splits it into parts. This is a common approach for handling multiple test cases where each test case's input is provided sequentially.
2. **Loop Structure**: The program correctly iterates over each test case, reading `t` test cases as specified.
3. **Variable Usage**: The variables `n` and `s` are correctly assigned from the input for each test case.
4. **Count Calculation**: The program counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` using `count('U')`.
5. **Winning Condition Check**: The program checks if the count of 'U' is odd. If it is, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This logic aligns with the problem statement.
6. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' if Alice wins and 'NO' if Bob wins, which matches the required output format.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the number of 'U' characters being odd or even.

Correctness: **True**
