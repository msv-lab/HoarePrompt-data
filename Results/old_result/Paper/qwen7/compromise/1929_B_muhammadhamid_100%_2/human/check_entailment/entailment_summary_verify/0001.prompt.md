You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions. If \( k \) is 1, it prints 1. If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). The function reads the number of test cases from the first input, followed by pairs of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of cells to color such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The problem states that the grid is an \( n \times n \) square, and it has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
   - For small values of \( k \), we can directly calculate the minimum number of cells needed.
   - For larger values of \( k \), we need to consider the structure of the diagonals and how they overlap.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color 1 cell. This is handled correctly by the code.
   - If \( k \leq 2(n + (n-2)) \), the code calculates the minimum number of cells using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - For \( k > 2(n + (n-2)) \), the code prints `k // 2 + 1`.

3. **Detailed Calculation**:
   - The expression \( 2(n + (n-2)) \) simplifies to \( 4n - 4 \).
   - For \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the code correctly uses `math.ceil(k / 2)` to find the minimum number of cells.
   - For \( k > 4n - 4 \), the code uses `k // 2 + 1`, which is also correct because it ensures that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

4. **Examples**:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \).
     - Since \( k = 4 \leq 4n - 4 = 8 \), the code calculates \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \).
     - Since \( k = 3 \leq 4n - 4 = 8 \), the code calculates \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \).
     - Since \( k = 10 > 4n - 4 = 8 \), the code calculates \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \).

5. **General Case**:
   - The logic handles both small and large values of \( k \) correctly, ensuring that the minimum number of cells is calculated accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly determines the minimum number of cells to color for any given \( n \) and \( k \) within the specified constraints.
