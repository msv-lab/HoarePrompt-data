### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the remainder when a number is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is used to ensure the final result fits within the required modulo constraint.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray, but it has significant logical flaws.
   - The logic inside the loop is incorrect and does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
   - The function appends segments to `segments_variants` and then finds the maximum segment, but this approach is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem.
   - The function returns a list containing `-1`, indicating that no valid segment was found, which is incorrect since the problem guarantees a valid solution.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function is completely empty and unused in the provided code.
   - It appears to be a placeholder and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Given these issues, the overall logic of the program is flawed. The core issue lies in `func_2`, which incorrectly identifies the maximum sum subarray. The program does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified that the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_2`. The provided code does not solve the problem as intended and fails to correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect.
