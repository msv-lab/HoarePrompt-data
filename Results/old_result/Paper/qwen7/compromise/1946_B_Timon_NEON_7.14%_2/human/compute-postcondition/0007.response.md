Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is `[max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]]`**

Explanation: The provided line of code appends a new element to the `segments_variants` list. Specifically, it appends `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`. Given the initial state, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, and `len(arr)` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a positive integer (since `segments_variants` is initially empty, implying `arr` has at least one element). Therefore, the appended value to `segments_variants` is `[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]`. All other variables (`max_sum`, `new_segment`, and `max_segment`) remain unchanged.
