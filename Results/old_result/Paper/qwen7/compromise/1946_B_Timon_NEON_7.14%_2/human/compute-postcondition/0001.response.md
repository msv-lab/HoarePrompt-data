The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `number` and `quantity`. `number` is an integer representing the sum of the original array, and `quantity` is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations k. The function does not return any specific value based on the given constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept an integer `number` representing the sum of the original array and a non-negative integer `quantity` representing the number of operations k, without specifying any particular output or action beyond these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` representing the sum of the original array and a non-negative integer `quantity` representing the number of operations k, without specifying any particular output or action beyond these parameters.**
