Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `len(nums) - 2`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least 0 (since `i` starts from 0).

3. **Analyze the given state**:
   - `cd` is 0.
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning.
   - The length of `nums` is not equal to 2.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we need to ensure that `i` can be incremented without exceeding `len(nums) - 2`.
   - Given that `nums` is a sorted list with an additional 0 at the beginning, the minimum length of `nums` must be 3 (since it cannot be 2).
   - Therefore, `len(nums)` must be at least 3, making `len(nums) - 2` at least 1.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `len(nums)` should be at least 3.

So, the final state is:
**`cd` is 0, `i` is 0, `len(nums)` must be at least 3**.
