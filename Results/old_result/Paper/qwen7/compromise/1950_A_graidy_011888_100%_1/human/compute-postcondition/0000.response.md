Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
