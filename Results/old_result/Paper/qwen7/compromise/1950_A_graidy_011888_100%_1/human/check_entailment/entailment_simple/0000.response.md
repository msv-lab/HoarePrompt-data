Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic for determining whether three given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. It reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case and converts them into integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - For a stair (`a < b < c`), the program checks if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. If true, it prints "STAIR".
   - For a peak (`a < b and b > c`), the program checks if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output Formatting**: The program outputs the results in the correct format, with each line corresponding to the result of a single test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
