Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function which uses `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 each time, the loop will execute as long as `i < not_mid`.

3. **Adjust the state of `not_mid`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `not_mid` must be greater than 0.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `arr`, `cliquess`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `not_mid` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
**`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left < right`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list where elements from index `left + mid - 1` to `left` are filled with values starting from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, `cliquess` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `clique`.**
