Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left < right`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `right + 1` to the variable `big_element`. The values of `left`, `right`, and `small_element` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new assignment for `big_element`.
