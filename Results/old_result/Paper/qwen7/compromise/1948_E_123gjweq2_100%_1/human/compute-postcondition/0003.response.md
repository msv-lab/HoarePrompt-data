Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left < right`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1**.

Explanation: The code calculates `not_mid` as `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given that `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, substituting this into the equation for `not_mid` gives us `not_mid` as `right - left - mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
