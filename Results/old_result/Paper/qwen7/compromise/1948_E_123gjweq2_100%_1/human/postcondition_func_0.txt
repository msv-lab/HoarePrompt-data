The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * n. It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and populates an array `arr` with `n` ones. Additionally, it prints the array `arr`, the number of cliques, and an array `cliquess` filled with `n` zeros.
