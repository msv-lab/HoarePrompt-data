You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to populate the array `arr` based on the specified range and clique index.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cliques` is equal to ceil(`n` / `k`), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, `arr` is a list of `n` ones, `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = cliques - 1`. For each iteration, the function `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)` is called. This function sets the elements in the `arr` list from index `i * k` to `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)` (inclusive) to `i + 1`. Since `i + 1` will take on values from 1 to `cliques`, and each element in `arr` will be set to one of these values within its respective range, the final state of `arr` will be a list of `n` ones. The variable `cliquess` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is the ceiling of n divided by k)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (where there are n zeros)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that left < right and both are within the range [0, n-1], where n is the length of the array arr. clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left < right`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1`, `arr` is a list where elements from index `left + mid - 1` to `left` are filled with values starting from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, `cliquess` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `clique`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i

    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left < right`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1`, `arr` is a list where elements from index `left + mid - 1` to `left` are filled with values starting from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and elements from index `left` to `left + not_mid - 1` are filled with values starting from `big_element - (i + 1)` to `big_element - i`, `cliquess` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `clique`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`.
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two arrays: `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.

2. **Loop to Assign Values**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `cliques - 1`.
   - For each iteration `i`, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - The `make_array` function fills the array in a specific pattern, ensuring that elements within the same segment (determined by `left` and `right`) are assigned different values but within the range `[1, n]`.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on `left` and `right`.
   - It splits the range into two parts (`mid` and `not_mid`) and fills the array accordingly.
   - Elements in the first half are filled with smaller values starting from `small_element`, and elements in the second half are filled with larger values starting from `big_element`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that:
1. The values in `arr` are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.
2. The conditions for forming cliques are met: for every pair of vertices `(i, j)`, `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
3. The partition into cliques is minimal.

#### Example Verification

Let's take the example from the problem statement:
- For `n = 5` and `k = 4`:
  - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
  - The expected output is:
    ```
    3 1 5 2 4
    2
    1 1 2 1 2
    ```

- Let's manually check the conditions:
  - Vertices 1 and 2: `|1-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3 <= 4` (valid)
  - Vertices 1 and 3: `|1-3| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 <= 4` (valid)
  - Vertices 1 and 4: `|1-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 <= 4` (valid)
  - Vertices 1 and 5: `|1-5| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 > 4` (invalid, but they are in different cliques)
  - And so on...

- The partition ensures that vertices within the same clique satisfy the condition, and vertices in different cliques do not.

### Conclusion

The program correctly assigns values to the vertices and partitions them into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
