### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires creating a graph on \( n \) vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Input Parameters**: `n` (number of vertices) and `k` (an integer).
   - **Cliques Calculation**: The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - **Array Initialization**: An array `arr` of size `n` is initialized with all elements set to 0. Another array `cliquess` of size `n` is also initialized with all elements set to 0.
   - **Filling the Array**: The function `make_array` is called for each clique index from `0` to `cliques - 1`. This function fills segments of `arr` with increasing and decreasing sequences of integers, ensuring that each segment corresponds to a clique.
   - **Output**: The function prints the array `arr`, the number of cliques, and the array `cliquess`.

3. **Function `make_array` Analysis**:
   - **Input Parameters**: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - **Array Filling**: The function fills a segment of `arr` from `left` to `right` with a sequence of increasing and decreasing integers. The segment is split into two halves, and the first half is filled with increasing integers, while the second half is filled with decreasing integers. The corresponding segment in `cliquess` is set to the `clique` identifier.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of cliques and ensures that each vertex is assigned a unique integer from 1 to `n`.
   - The function `make_array` correctly fills the segments of `arr` and `cliquess` according to the specified rules, ensuring that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The output format matches the required format: the array `arr` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the number of cliques is correct, and the partition into cliques is valid.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
