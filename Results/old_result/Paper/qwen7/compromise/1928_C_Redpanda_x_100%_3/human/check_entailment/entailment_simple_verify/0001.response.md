### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine how many values of \( k \) fit the given constraints for each test case.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya's position in the line is \( n \), and the number he received is \( x \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern is periodic with a period of \( 2k-2 \).
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to find all possible \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) and the settling pattern fits.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - `func_1(n)` is intended to find the prime factors of \( n \).
   - `generate(k)` is intended to generate all possible products of the prime factors raised to various powers.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided functions do not directly solve the problem. They are meant to find the prime factors and their powers, but they are not used correctly to solve the problem at hand.
   - The logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values from the factors is missing.
   - The annotated code shows that the program attempts to use the factors of \( n \) to find valid \( k \) values, but the implementation is flawed.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to determine the period \( 2k-2 \) that fits within the range \( 1 \leq x < n \).
   - We need to check if \( n \mod (2k-2) \) results in \( x \).
   - We need to iterate over possible values of \( k \) and count those that satisfy the condition.

6. **Evaluation of the Given Code**:
   - The code uses the `func_1` function to get the prime factors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \).
   - It then checks if the factors are even and if \( k/2 + 1 \geq x \).
   - However, the logic to determine the valid \( k \) values is not correctly implemented. The code does not properly handle the periodicity and the modulo operation to find valid \( k \).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values is flawed.
   - The annotated code provides insight into the intended approach but does not fix the fundamental issues in the logic.
