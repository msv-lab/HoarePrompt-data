Output State: `prime_to_i` is `factor * prime_to_i * prime * prime`, `rest` is the list without its first element, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `factors[prime]` is incremented by 3, and no new value is yielded.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `prime_to_i` will be updated by multiplying it with `prime` three times (as per the given pattern), making it `factor * prime_to_i * prime * prime`. The `rest` list remains unchanged as no elements are added or removed from it other than the initial assumption. The `factor` variable is updated to the first element of the modified `rest` list, and `factors[prime]` is incremented by 3 since the loop runs `factors[prime] + 1` times and `factors[prime]` was initially incremented by 1 before the loop started. No new value is yielded as the loop completes its iterations.
