Output State: **`prime_to_i` is `factor * prime_to_i`, `rest` is the list without its first element, and `factor` is the first element of `rest`; the function yields `factor * prime_to_i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` updates the generator's state to yield the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. After yielding, the variables `prime_to_i` and `rest` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `factor` remains the first element of `rest`. The value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded, but since we are only asked to describe the state of the variables, we note that the function yields this value.
