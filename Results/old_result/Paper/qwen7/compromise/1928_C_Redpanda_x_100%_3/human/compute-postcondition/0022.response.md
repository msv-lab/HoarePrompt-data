Output State: **`prime_to_i` is `factor * prime_to_i`, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `rest` is the list without its first element, `prime_to_i` is updated to `factor * prime_to_i`.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`. Since `prime` is equal to `factor * prime_to_i` from the initial state, `prime_to_i` is now updated to `factor * prime_to_i`. The values of `factor` and `rest` remain unchanged.
