Output State: `prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `rest` is the list without its first two elements, `factor` is the second element of the modified `rest` list, `factors[prime]` must be at least 2, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded after each iteration.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `prime_to_i` will be updated to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`. The `rest` list remains unchanged except for having its first two elements removed. The `factor` variable is set to the second element of the modified `rest` list. The condition for the loop to continue is that `factors[prime]` must be at least 2. After each iteration, the value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.
