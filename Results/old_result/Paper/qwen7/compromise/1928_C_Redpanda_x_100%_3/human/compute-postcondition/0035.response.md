Output State: **`prime_to_i` is 1, `rest` is the list without its first two elements, `factor` is the second element of the modified `rest` list, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

This means that the value of `prime_to_i` remains unchanged at 1, the list `rest` does not change except for losing its first two elements, the variable `factor` remains the second element of the modified `rest` list, and `factors[prime]` must still be at least 0. Additionally, the value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded (returned).
