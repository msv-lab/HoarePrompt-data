Output State: `prime_to_i` is set to 1, `factor` is equal to the product of `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`, and the loop has executed `factors[prime] + 1` times.

Explanation: Since the loop runs for `factors[prime] + 1` times, after all iterations, `prime_to_i` will be multiplied by `prime` exactly `factors[prime]` times (as per the given output states), resulting in `prime_to_i` being equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`. The value of `factor` will be updated to this new value of `prime_to_i` after the loop completes. Additionally, `factors[prime]` will be decremented by 1 after the loop, making it 0 if it was initially greater than 0.
