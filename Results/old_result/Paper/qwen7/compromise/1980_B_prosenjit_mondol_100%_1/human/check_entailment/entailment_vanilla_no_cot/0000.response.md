Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the following steps accurately:

1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the number of cubes (`n`), the index of the favorite cube (`f`), and the number of removed cubes (`k`).
3. Adjusting the index of the favorite cube and the number of removed cubes to be zero-based.
4. Reading the values shown on the cubes.
5. Sorting the values in non-increasing order.
6. Checking if the value of the cube that was originally at the `f`-th position is greater than the value of the `k`-th cube after sorting:
   - If yes, the favorite cube is not removed, so it prints "NO".
   - If no, the favorite cube is removed, so it prints "YES".
   - If the values are equal, it further checks if the `k`-th cube is the last cube or if the `(k+1)`-th cube is smaller than the original value of the favorite cube to determine if it might be removed:
     - If the `k`-th cube is the last cube or the `(k+1)`-th cube is smaller, the favorite cube is removed, so it prints "YES".
     - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE".

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
