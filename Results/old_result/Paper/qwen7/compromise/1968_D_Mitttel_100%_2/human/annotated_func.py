#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array a, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, s is a list of integers representing the starting positions P_B and P_S, and k is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is `0`, `mx` is the maximum value between its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]` after all iterations, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is the final position in the permutation after all iterations, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `1` at the indices visited during the iterations and `0` elsewhere.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` will be `0` because the loop condition `k > 0` will no longer be satisfied. The variable `mx` will hold the maximum value between its initial value (0) and the cumulative value of `cur + k * a[s]` after all iterations. The list `vis` will mark all visited positions in the permutation `p` with `1`, and the rest will remain `0`. The variables `n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, and `cur` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the cumulative value of cur + 0 * a[s] after all iterations, with the list vis marking all visited positions in the permutation p with 1 and the rest as 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: an array `a` of integers, a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, a list `s` of integers representing starting positions, and a non-negative integer `k`. It iterates through the permutation based on the starting positions until `k` becomes zero or all positions are visited. During each iteration, it updates the current sum `cur` and the maximum value `mx`. After completing the iterations, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the final value of `cur + 0 * a[s]`, with a list `vis` marking all visited positions in the permutation `p` as 1 and the rest as 0.
