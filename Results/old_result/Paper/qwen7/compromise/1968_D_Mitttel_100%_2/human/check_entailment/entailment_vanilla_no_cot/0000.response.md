Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a given starting position `s` over `k` turns. However, the logic inside the function is flawed. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that the player will stay at the current position until the end, which is not necessarily true. The player can move to `p[s]` at any point during the `k` turns.

2. **Game Logic**: The main loop of the program calls `func_1` with `pb-1` and `ps-1` as starting positions. This adjustment (`-1`) is correct because the indices in the arrays start from 0, but the logic within `func_1` needs to correctly simulate the game rules.

3. **Movement Logic**: The function should simulate the movement according to the rules of the game, considering that the player can move to `p[s]` at any point during the `k` turns. The current implementation does not correctly simulate this.

To fix these issues, the `func_1` function should simulate the game properly, taking into account the possibility of moving to `p[s]` at any turn. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    stack = [(s, k)]
    
    while stack:
        s, k = stack.pop()
        if k <= 0:
            continue
        if vis[s]:
            continue
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        stack.append((s, k))
        stack.append((p[s], k))
    
    return mx
```

With this corrected function, the overall program logic remains the same, but it now correctly simulates the game according to the rules.
