### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- The game involves two players (Bodya and Sasha) taking turns based on a permutation and an array of scores.
- Both players start at specified positions and take `k` turns.
- Each turn, a player's score increases by the value at their current position in the array `a`.
- After scoring, a player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation `p`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a single player starting at a given position `s` over `k` turns.
- It uses a while loop to simulate the player's moves, updating the score and marking visited positions.
- The function does not consider the simultaneous nature of the game; it only calculates the score for one player.

#### Program Analysis:
- The main program reads input for multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1` twice: once for Bodya's starting position (`pb - 1`) and once for Sasha's starting position (`ps - 1`).
- It then compares the scores returned by `func_1` and prints the result accordingly.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Single Player Simulation**: The function `func_1` only calculates the score for one player and does not simulate the other player's moves.
2. **Simultaneous Moves**: The function does not handle the simultaneous nature of the game, where both players must choose their moves independently.
3. **Score Comparison**: The main program does not compare the scores of both players to determine the winner.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The function `func_1` correctly simulates the moves for a single player over `k` turns.
- However, it does not account for the simultaneous nature of the game, which requires both players' scores to be compared.
- The main program does not correctly implement the game logic for both players.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" because it only simulates the moves for one player and does not compare the scores of both players.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the game for both players and does not compare their scores to determine the winner.
