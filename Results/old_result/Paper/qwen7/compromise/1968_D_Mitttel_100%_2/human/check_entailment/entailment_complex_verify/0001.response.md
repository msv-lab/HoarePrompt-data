### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb` (Bodya's starting position), `ps` (Sasha's starting position), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha, passing the necessary parameters. This function is responsible for calculating the maximum possible score for a given starting position.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes variables to keep track of the maximum score (`mx`), the current score (`cur`), and a visited array (`vis`) to avoid revisiting positions.
   - It iteratively updates the score and moves through the permutation until it either runs out of moves (`k <= 0`) or visits all positions.
   - The function returns the maximum score achievable from the given starting position.

4. **Score Comparison**:
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Sasha'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the scores are equal by printing 'Draw'.
   - It correctly identifies when Bodya has a higher score and when Sasha has a higher score.
   - The logic for determining the winner is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

However, upon closer inspection of the `func_1` function, there is a critical issue with the way the function calculates the maximum score. Specifically, the function only considers the score accumulated during the iterations and does not account for the possibility of staying at the current position without moving to `p[s]` in every iteration. This can lead to an incorrect calculation of the maximum score.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function uses a while loop to iterate through the permutation until `k` becomes zero or all positions are visited.
  - In each iteration, it updates the current score `cur` and the maximum score `mx`.
  - However, the function only considers the score accumulated during the iterations and does not account for the possibility of staying at the current position without moving to `p[s]` in every iteration.

- **Example Counterexample**:
  - Consider the following input:
    ```
    1
    2 2 1 2
    2 1
    5 3 2
    ```
  - Here, `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `pb = 1`, `ps = 2`.
  - The permutation `p` is `[2, 1]` and the array `a` is `[5, 3]`.
  - According to the problem statement, both players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation.
  - For Bodya starting at position 1:
    - First turn: Stay at position 1, score = 5.
    - Second turn: Move to position 2, score = 5 + 3 = 8.
  - For Sasha starting at position 2:
    - First turn: Stay at position 2, score = 3.
    - Second turn: Move to position 1, score = 3 + 5 = 8.
  - Both players end up with a score of 8, resulting in a draw.

- **Current Function Behavior**:
  - The function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of staying at the current position in every iteration, leading to an incorrect calculation of the maximum score.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the maximum score for a given starting position. The function only considers the score accumulated during the iterations and does not account for the possibility of staying at the current position without moving to `p[s]` in every iteration.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
