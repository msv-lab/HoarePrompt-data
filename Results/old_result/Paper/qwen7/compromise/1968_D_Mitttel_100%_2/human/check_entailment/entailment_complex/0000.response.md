Reasoning:
1. The main program reads input and calls the `func_1` function for both players' starting positions.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
3. The function correctly initializes variables and uses a loop to simulate the game turns, updating the current score (`cur`) and the maximum score (`mx`) accordingly.
4. The function marks visited positions in the permutation using the `vis` list.
5. The function returns the maximum score achievable from the starting position.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in `func_1` seems to correctly simulate the game for one player. The main program then compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic in the main program. The main program subtracts 1 from the starting positions `pb` and `ps` before passing them to `func_1`. This adjustment is necessary because the permutation indices start from 1, but the implementation inside `func_1` expects indices to start from 0. Therefore, the main program should pass `pb - 1` and `ps - 1` to `func_1`.

Since the main program passes `pb - 1` and `ps - 1` to `func_1`, the logic in `func_1` should work correctly for the adjusted indices.

Correctness: **True**
