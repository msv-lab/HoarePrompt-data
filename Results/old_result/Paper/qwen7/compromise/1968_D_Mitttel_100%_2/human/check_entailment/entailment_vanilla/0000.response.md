Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation**: The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb` (Bodya's starting position), `ps` (Sasha's starting position), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It also adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha, passing the necessary parameters. This function is responsible for calculating the maximum possible score for a given starting position.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes variables to keep track of the maximum score (`mx`), the current score (`cur`), and a visited array (`vis`) to avoid revisiting positions.
   - It iteratively updates the score and moves through the permutation until it either runs out of moves (`k <= 0`) or visits all positions.
   - The function returns the maximum score achievable from the given starting position.

4. **Score Comparison**:
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Sasha'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the scores are equal by printing 'Draw'.
   - It correctly identifies when Bodya has a higher score and when Sasha has a higher score.
   - The logic for determining the winner is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all cases appropriately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
