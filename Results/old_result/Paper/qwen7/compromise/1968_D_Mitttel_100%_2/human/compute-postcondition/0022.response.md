Output State: **`vis[s]` is 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[s]` updates the value of `s` to `p[s]`. All other variables (`vis[s]`, `k`, `mx`, `cur`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `s` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
