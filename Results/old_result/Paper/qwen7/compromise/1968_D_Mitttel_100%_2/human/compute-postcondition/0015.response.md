Output State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s[0]` must not be equal to `s`, `vis[s]` is 1, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s]` updates the value of `s` to the value of `p[s]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
