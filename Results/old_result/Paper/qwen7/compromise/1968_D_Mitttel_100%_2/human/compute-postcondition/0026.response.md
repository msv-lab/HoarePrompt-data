Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: a (a list of integers), p (a permutation of integers from 1 to n), s (a list of integers representing starting positions), and k (a non-negative integer). It returns the maximum value between 0 and the cumulative value of cur + 0 * a[s] after all iterations, with the list vis marking all visited positions in the permutation p with 1 and the rest as 0.**
