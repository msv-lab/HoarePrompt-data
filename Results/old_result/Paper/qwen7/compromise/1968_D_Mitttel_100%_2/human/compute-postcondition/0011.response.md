Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `s[0]` must not be equal to `s`; `vis[s]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `vis[s] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the dictionary key `s`. The conditions for `k` and `s[0]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` must still be greater than 0, `s[0]` must not be equal to `s`, and `vis[s]` is now 1.
