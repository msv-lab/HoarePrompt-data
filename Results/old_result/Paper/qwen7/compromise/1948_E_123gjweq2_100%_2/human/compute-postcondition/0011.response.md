Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It fills an array `arr` with values from `left` to `right - 1` such that the first half of the range is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. Additionally, it sets the corresponding entries in the `cliquess` list to the value of `clique`.**
