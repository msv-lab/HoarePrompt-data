Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, and `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range; `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

This means that the value of `left` and `right` remains unchanged, and `clique` also remains unchanged. The new variable `small_element` is set to `left + 1`.
