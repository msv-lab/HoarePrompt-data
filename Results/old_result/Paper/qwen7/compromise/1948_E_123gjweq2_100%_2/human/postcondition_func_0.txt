The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * `n`. It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n` divided by `k` and initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`. It then calls the `make_array` function to fill `arr` with values such that each segment of `arr` is set to the same value, resulting in `arr` being a list of `n` ones. The function prints `arr`, the calculated number of cliques, and `cliquess`. Finally, it returns `arr` and `cliquess`.
