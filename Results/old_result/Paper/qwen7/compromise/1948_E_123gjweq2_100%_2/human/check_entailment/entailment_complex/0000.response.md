Reasoning:
- The problem requires creating a graph partitioned into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints.
- The provided solution attempts to achieve this by dividing the vertices into segments and assigning each segment to a different clique.
- In `func_1`, the number of cliques is correctly calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
- The `make_array` function is supposed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays such that each segment of vertices is assigned to a specific clique.
- However, the implementation of `make_array` is flawed:
  - It incorrectly sets the `arr` values in the middle of the range, leading to incorrect assignments.
  - The logic for setting `arr` and `cliquess` values is not consistent with the problem's requirements.
- The provided solution does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
