Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of three integers sorted in descending order: [x, k, n], `sum1` is x + k + n, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i == 0`, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`. `ans` contains the value of the updated `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions:
- If `i` equals 0, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.
- Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`.
In both cases, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `ans` contains `sums`, and `sums` is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i == 0`, or `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
