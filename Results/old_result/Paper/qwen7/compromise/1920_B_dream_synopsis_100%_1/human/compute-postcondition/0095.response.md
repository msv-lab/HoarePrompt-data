Output State: The list `a` remains as a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` is calculated based on the conditions within the loop:

- If `i == 0`, the first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations where `i + x - 1 < n`, each element in `ans` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- For iterations where `i + x - 1 >= n`, each element in `ans` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

In summary, `ans` will contain the sequence of sums calculated according to the given conditions over all iterations of the loop.
