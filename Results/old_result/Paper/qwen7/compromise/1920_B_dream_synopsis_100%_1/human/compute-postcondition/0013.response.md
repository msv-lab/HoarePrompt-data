Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, and the value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0, so `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[-1]`, which is undefined in Python unless `a` is a list with at least one element. However, since the problem does not specify the exact nature of `a`, we assume it is defined and accessible. The value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, so `i + x - 1` is a valid index for the list `a`. The output state includes the updated `sums` value and retains the other initial conditions.
