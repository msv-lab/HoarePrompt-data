Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is at least 1; `sums` is `sums + a[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, `i - 1` equals 1, so `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
