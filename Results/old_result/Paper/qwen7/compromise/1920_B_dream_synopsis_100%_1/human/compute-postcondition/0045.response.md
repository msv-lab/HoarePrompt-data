Output State: The loop will execute exactly `k + 1` times. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

To summarize, `i` will be `k`, `k` will still be a non-negative integer, `sums` will be the final calculated value after the last iteration of the loop, and `ans` will be a list with `k + 1` elements, where each element represents the value of `sums` after each iteration from 0 to `k`.
