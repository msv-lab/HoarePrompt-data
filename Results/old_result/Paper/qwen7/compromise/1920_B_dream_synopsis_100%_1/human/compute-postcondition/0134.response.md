Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[1 + x - 1]`**.

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to 0.
- The variable `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` which is `a[1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` which is `2 * a[1 + x - 1]`. Therefore, `sums` is now `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[1 + x - 1]`.
