Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is greater than or equal to 0
   - `ans` contains either `[sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x], sums]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `[sums + a[0], sums]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Determine the new condition for `k`**: For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `k + 1`. Given that `i` is now 2, `k` must be at least 2 (since `2 < k + 1` implies `k >= 1`).

6. **Adjust the state of `ans`**: The value of `ans` does not change within the loop itself based on the given information. Therefore, it remains the same.

Given these points, we can conclude the following:

- `i` will be 2.
- `k` must be at least 2.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ans` contains either `[sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x], sums]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `[sums + a[0], sums]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.**
