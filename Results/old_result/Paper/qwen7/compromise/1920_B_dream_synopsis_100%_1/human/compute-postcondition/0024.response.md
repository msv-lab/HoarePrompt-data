Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`**.

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is already defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, appending it to `ans` does not change its value but adds it to the list `ans`. The other variables (`i`, `k`) remain unchanged.
