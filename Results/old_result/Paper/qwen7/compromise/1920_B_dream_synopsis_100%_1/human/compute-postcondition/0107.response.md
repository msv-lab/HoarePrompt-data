Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `ans` contains `sums`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The value of `sums` itself does not change; it is simply added to the list `ans`.
