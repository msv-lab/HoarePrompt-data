Output State: The loop will execute `k + 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, and `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` will be calculated based on the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically:

- If `i == 0`, the initial value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations where `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- For iterations where `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

In summary, `ans` will contain `k + 1` values starting from the initial `sums` value and updated according to the given conditions for each iteration of the loop.
