Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing an additional element based on the conditions provided, `sums` is `sum1 + a[2] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[2]` since `i` is 3) and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. However, the value of `x` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i + x - 1]`. Therefore, `sums` is updated to be the sum of all elements in `a` (`sum1`) plus `a[2]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
