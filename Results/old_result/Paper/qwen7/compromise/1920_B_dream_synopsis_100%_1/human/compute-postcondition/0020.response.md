Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions:
- If `i` is 0, `sums` is initially `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- If `i` is 1 and `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- If `i` is 1 and `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`.
`ans` contains the value of the updated `sums`.
