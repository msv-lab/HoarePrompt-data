Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is at least 1
   - `sums` is updated based on specific conditions (details provided)
   - `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(k + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `k`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, it is the only state that needs to be adjusted.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `sums` and `ans` are updated within the loop body but their values depend on the loop condition and are not directly adjusted here.

7. **Updated State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `k` remains at least 1.
   - `sums` and `ans` are updated based on the loop body, but their values are not specified here.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `k` is at least 1**
