Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is at least 1; `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 2) and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` (which is `2 * a[x]` since `i` is 2). The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
