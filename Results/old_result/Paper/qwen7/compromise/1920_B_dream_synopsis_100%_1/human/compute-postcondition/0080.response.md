Postcondition: `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is a list containing either `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0, or `sums = a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums = a[0]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`. In both cases, `ans` is updated to contain an additional element based on the conditions provided. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is appended with `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` contains `sum1 + a[0]` as the new element.
