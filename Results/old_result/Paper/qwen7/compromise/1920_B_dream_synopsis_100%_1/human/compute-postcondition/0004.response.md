Output State: **`a` is a list of three integers sorted in descending order: [x, k, n]**.

Explanation: The initial state of `a` is a list `[n, k, x]` sorted in ascending order, where `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing `a.reverse()`, the list `a` is reversed, resulting in the list being sorted in descending order: `[x, k, n]`.
