Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions:
- If `i` equals 0, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.
- Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`.
In both cases, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`.
