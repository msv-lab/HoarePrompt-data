Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is at least 1; `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`; `ans` contains the value of `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `k`, and the expression for `sums` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the `ans` list.
