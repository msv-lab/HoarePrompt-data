Output State: **`i` is 2 (if `i` was 1), `i` is 4 (if `i` was 3), etc., `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `answer` contains the element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index `a[-1]` of the array `array` to the list `answer`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The updated state of `answer` includes the previously contained elements plus the new element from `array[a[-1]]`.
