Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 1 initially, and `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Check the Given States:**
   - `i` is currently equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an integer inputted by the user.
   - `answer` contains `[1]`.
   - `a` is `[1, -1]`.
   - `a[0]` and `a[-1]` have been adjusted based on the loop conditions.
   - `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, we need to set `i` to 1.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
