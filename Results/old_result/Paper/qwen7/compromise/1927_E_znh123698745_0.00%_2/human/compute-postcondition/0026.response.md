Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `answer` contains the element at index 0 from `array`, and the element at index 0 in `array` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the element at index 0 in the array `a` (which is the same as `array`) by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `answer` still contains the element at index 0 from `array`, which now has been incremented by 1.
