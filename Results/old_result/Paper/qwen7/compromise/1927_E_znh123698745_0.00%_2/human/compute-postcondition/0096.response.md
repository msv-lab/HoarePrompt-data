Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes two integers, `n` and `k`, within specified ranges, with `k` being even. For each test case, it returns whether the conditions are met (i.e., 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even) or not.**
