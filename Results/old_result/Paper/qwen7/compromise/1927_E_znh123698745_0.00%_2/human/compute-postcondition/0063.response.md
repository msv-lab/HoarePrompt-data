Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list with two elements where `a[0]` is `n + 2` and `a[-1]` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not affect the existing values of `i`, `a`, `array`, or `answer`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged, while `n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the input.
