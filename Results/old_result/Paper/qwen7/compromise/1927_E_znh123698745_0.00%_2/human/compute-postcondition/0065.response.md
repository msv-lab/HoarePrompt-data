Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list with two elements where `a[0]` is `n + 2` and `a[-1]` is -1, `answer` is `[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.**

Explanation: The line `answer = [1]` initializes a new list called `answer` with a single element `1`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `array`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
