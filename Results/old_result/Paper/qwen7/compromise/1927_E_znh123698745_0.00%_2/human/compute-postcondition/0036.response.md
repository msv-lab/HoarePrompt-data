Output State: **`i` is `n`, `answer` contains `[1]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `n` and `k` are integers inputted by the user, `a[0]` and `a[-1]` have been adjusted based on the loop conditions, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `a` with the values `[1, -1]`. This changes the value of `a` from its previous state, but does not affect the values of `i`, `answer`, `n`, `k`, `a[0]`, `a[-1]`, or `array`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the updated list `a`.
