Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `answer` is updated with the element at index `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` from the `array` to the list `answer`. However, the initial values and conditions of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains 2, `n` must still be greater than 1, and `answer` is updated with the new element.
