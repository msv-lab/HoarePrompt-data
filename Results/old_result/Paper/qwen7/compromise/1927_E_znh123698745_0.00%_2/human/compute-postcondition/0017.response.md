Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `answer` is updated with the element at index `array[a[-1] - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide the exact value of `a`, we know that the last element of `a` (denoted as `a[-1]`) is decreased by 1. The other variables `i`, `n`, and `answer` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `answer` is now updated with the element at the new index `a[-1] - 1` in the `array`.
