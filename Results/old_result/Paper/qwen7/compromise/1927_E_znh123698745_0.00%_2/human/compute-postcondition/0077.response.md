Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: 
   - If `i` is odd, `answer` appends the last element of `array` to itself, and `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.
   - If `i` is even, `a[0]` is increased by 1, and `answer` appends the element `array[a[0]]` to itself.

4. **Analyze the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - If `i` is odd, `answer` contains the last element of `array` appended to it, and `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.
   - If `i` is even, `a[0]` is increased by 1, and `answer` contains the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it.

5. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(1, n)`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `i + 1` is still within the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - If `i` was odd, the next `i` (which is `i + 1`) will be even.
   - If `i` was even, the next `i` (which is `i + 1`) will be odd.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Depending on whether `i` was odd or even, the conditions for `answer` and `a[0]`/`a[-1]` will change accordingly.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- If `i` was odd, `i + 1` will be even, so `a[0]` will be increased by 1, and `answer` will contain the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it.
- If `i` was even, `i + 1` will be odd, so `a[-1]` will be decreased by 1, and `answer` will contain the last element of `array` appended to it.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

**State:**
- `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was odd, `i` becomes even, and if `i` was even, `i` becomes odd.
- `n` remains the same.
- `answer` will either append the last element of `array` (if `i` was odd) or the element `array[a[0]]` (if `i` was even).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2 (if `i` was 1), `i` is 4 (if `i` was 3), etc., `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `answer` will contain the last element of `array` appended to it if `i` was odd, or the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it if `i` was even**.
