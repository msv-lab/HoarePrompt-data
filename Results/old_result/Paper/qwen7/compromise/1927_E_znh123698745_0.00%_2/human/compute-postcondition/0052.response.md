Postcondition: `i` is either \(n\) or \(n-1\), `a` is a list, `array` is a predefined list, and `answer` is a list. If `i` is \(n-1\), then the last element of `a` is decreased by 1, and the last element of the updated `a` is appended to `answer`. If `i` is \(n\), then the first element of `a` is increased by 1, and `answer` contains the first element of `array` at index `a[0]`.
