You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute \(n-1\) times in total. After all iterations, the value of \(i\) will be \(n-1\). The variable `answer` will contain \(n\) elements, starting with 1 and following the pattern described by the loop conditions. Specifically, if \((-1)^i\) is -1, the element at `array[a[-1]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` will be decreased by 1. Otherwise, the element at `array[a[0]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[0]` will be increased by 1. The final state of `a` will be such that `a[0]` is \(n\) and `a[-1]` is 1. The `array` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The `answer` list will contain elements from the `array` in a specific alternating pattern based on the loop conditions, starting with 1 and ending with either the first or last element of the original `array`, depending on the parity of \(n\).
    #
    #In summary, the final `answer` list will contain \(n\) elements, starting with 1 and following the described pattern, with `a[0]` being \(n\) and `a[-1]` being 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes two integers, `n` and `k`, within specified ranges, with `k` being even. For each test case, it returns whether the conditions are met (i.e., 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even) or not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
