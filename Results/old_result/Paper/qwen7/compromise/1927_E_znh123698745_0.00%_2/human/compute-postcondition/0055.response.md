Output State: **`i` is between 1 and \(n-1\); `answer` has one additional element which is `array[a[-1]-1]`**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Since `a[-1]` was previously equal to `array[a[-1]]`, after decrementing, `a[-1]` becomes `array[a[-1]] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `answer` still has one additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`, but now `a[-1]` is `array[a[-1]] - 1`.
