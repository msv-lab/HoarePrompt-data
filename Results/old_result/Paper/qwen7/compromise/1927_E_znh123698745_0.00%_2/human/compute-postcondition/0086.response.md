Output State: **`i` is 2 or 4; `n` must be greater than 2 or 4 respectively; `answer` contains the element `array[a[-1] - 1]` appended to it; `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition on `n` (it must be greater than `i`) also remains valid.
