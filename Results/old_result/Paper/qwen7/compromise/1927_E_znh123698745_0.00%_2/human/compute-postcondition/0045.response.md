Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `a` is a list, `array` is a predefined list, and `answer` is a list. If \((-1\) raised to the power of `i` equals -1\), then `answer` has one additional element which is `array[a[-1] - 1]`. If \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1, then `a[0]` is increased by 1, and `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[0]]`.
