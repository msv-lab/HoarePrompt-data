The function calculates and returns the total number of applications arranged in a grid using 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons. It takes the number of 1 × 1 icons (`x`) and the number of 2 × 2 icons (`y`) as input, where both are non-negative integers. Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it computes the number of rows needed to arrange these icons in a grid and returns this total number of rows. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it adjusts `x` based on the number of 2 × 2 icons and calculates the total rows accordingly. If `x` is 0, it only considers the 2 × 2 icons, and if `y` is 0, it only considers the 1 × 1 icons. In all cases, it ensures that the arrangement fits the given number of icons.
