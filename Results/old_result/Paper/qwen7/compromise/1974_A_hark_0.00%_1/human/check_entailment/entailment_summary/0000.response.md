Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a grid where each screen is a 5x3 grid.
2. The `func_2()` function is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens required based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
3. Let's break down the logic of `func_2()`:
   - If both `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons) are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit in half the rows (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, which is equivalent to 2 cells per row), and then adjusts the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
   - If only `y` (number of 2x2 icons) is greater than 0, it calculates the number of rows needed just for the 2x2 icons.
   - If only `x` (number of 1x1 icons) is greater than 0, it calculates the number of rows needed just for the 1x1 icons.
   - If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0 since no icons need to be placed.
4. The `func_3()` function reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_2()` for each test case.
5. Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_2()`, the function correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case.

Based on the above analysis, the implementation of the functions meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
