### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function simply returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`.
- It is not used in the main logic of the program, so we can ignore it for now.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function takes input values `x` and `y`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
- The logic inside `func_2` is complex and involves several calculations:
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates how many 2x2 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing the maximum possible 2x2 icons.
  - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the count of 1x1 icons based on the placement of 2x2 icons.
  - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
  - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

#### Detailed Analysis of Logic

1. **Case 1**: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
   - The calculation `math.ceil(y / 2)` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen.
   - The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` ensures that the remaining 1x1 icons are recalculated after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The final calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is correct for determining the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

2. **Case 2**: Only `y` is greater than 0.
   - The logic `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

3. **Case 3**: Only `x` is greater than 0.
   - The logic `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` is correct because each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

4. **Case 4**: Both `x` and `y` are 0.
   - The logic `print(0)` is correct because no icons need to be placed.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic in `func_2`:

- The calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. This equation does not accurately reflect the placement of 2x2 icons. Specifically, it incorrectly subtracts the space taken by 2x2 icons from the total space and adds back the space taken by 1x1 icons, which can lead to incorrect results.

- The calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` assumes that the remaining 1x1 icons will always fit into the remaining space, which may not be true due to the incorrect placement logic.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for different combinations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the placement of 2x2 icons and the subsequent calculation of the number of screens needed.

Final: **False**
