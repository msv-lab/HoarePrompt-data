### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used in the main logic of the program, but it is defined correctly.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the icons.
   - It handles different cases:
     - When both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
     - When only `y` is greater than 0.
     - When only `x` is greater than 0.
     - When both `x` and `y` are 0.
   - The logic inside the function seems to handle the placement of icons correctly:
     - For the case when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates how many 2x2 icons can fit and then adjusts the remaining 1x1 icons accordingly.
     - It uses `math.ceil` to ensure that partial screens are counted as full screens.
   - The function correctly updates and prints the number of screens required.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_2()` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the program processes each test case correctly and outputs the results for each one.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in `func_2()` appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The function handles all edge cases and uses appropriate mathematical operations to determine the minimum number of screens required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
