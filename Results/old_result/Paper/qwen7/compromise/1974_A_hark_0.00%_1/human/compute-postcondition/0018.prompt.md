You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: bxsfory1 + math.ceil(y / 2)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. If x is greater than 0 and y is 0, x represents the number of 1 × 1 icons and y remains 0. Otherwise, x and y represent the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively, and either x is 0 or y is not 0.
        #State: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. If x is 0, then y represents the number of 2 × 2 icons (and y > 0). Otherwise, x and y represent the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively, with at least one of them being non-zero.
    #State: `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` are calculated based on the values of `x` and `y`. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x > 0` else 0, `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. If `x` is 0, then `y` represents the number of 2 × 2 icons (and `y > 0`). Otherwise, `x` and `y` represent the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively, with at least one of them being non-zero.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns the total number of applications arranged in a grid using 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, where the number of 1 × 1 icons is represented by x and the number of 2 × 2 icons is represented by y.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
