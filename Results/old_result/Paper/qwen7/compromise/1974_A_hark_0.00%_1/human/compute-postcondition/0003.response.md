Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and it has been used to control the number of iterations in the loop. After the loop executes all the iterations, no other variables are affected by the loop, so their states remain unchanged. The loop itself does not change any variable's value; it only calls `func_2()` for `t` times.
