You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer n indicating the length of an array a, and an array a of n integers. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1(a)` to perform an unspecified operation on the array a and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Purpose**: This function checks if the array `a` can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
2. **Logic**:
   - It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - It iterates through all possible splits of `concatenated_a` and checks if any split matches `sorted_a`.

**Issues with `func_1`**:
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting and swapping parts of the array. Instead, it checks if the entire array `a` plus itself contains a subarray that is sorted. This is not equivalent to checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
- **Example Counterexample**: Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. Sorting this gives `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`. Concatenating `a` with itself gives `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. However, there is no way to split this concatenated array to get `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]` as a subarray. Therefore, `func_1` would incorrectly return `'Yes'` for this case.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Purpose**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. **Logic**:
   - It reads the input data and processes it to extract the number of test cases, the size of each array, and the elements of each array.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.

**Issues with `func_2`**:
- **Correct Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is correct in terms of reading input and calling `func_1`. However, since `func_1` has issues, the overall solution will still be incorrect.

### Conclusion
Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic, the program as a whole is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
