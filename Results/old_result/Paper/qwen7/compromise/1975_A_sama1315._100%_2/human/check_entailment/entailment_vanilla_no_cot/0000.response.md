Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts, but it does so by checking if a sorted version of the array is a subarray of the array concatenated with itself. This approach is flawed because it doesn't correctly simulate the operation described in the problem statement.
- The function `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1`, but the logic in `func_1` is incorrect for the problem's requirements. Specifically, the check `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:` does not guarantee that the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.
- To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if the array can be split and swapped such that the resulting array is non-decreasing. One way to do this is to ensure that the maximum element in the prefix is less than or equal to the minimum element in the suffix for all possible splits.

Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def can_become_non_decreasing(a):
    n = len(a)
    max_prefix = [a[0]]
    min_suffix = [a[-1]]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_prefix.append(max(max_prefix[-1], a[i]))
    
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        min_suffix.append(min(min_suffix[-1], a[i]))
    
    min_suffix.reverse()
    
    for i in range(n):
        if max_prefix[i] <= min_suffix[i]:
            return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = can_become_non_decreasing(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This code correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.
