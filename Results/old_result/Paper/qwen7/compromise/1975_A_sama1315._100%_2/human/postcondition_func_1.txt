The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer n indicating the length of an array a, and an array a of n integers. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1(a)` to perform an unspecified operation on the array a and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.
