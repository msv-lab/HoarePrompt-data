Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the input split by spaces, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`, and `idx` is 0.**

The variable `idx` is initialized to 0, which does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the addition of `idx` being set to 0.
