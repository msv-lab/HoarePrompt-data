The function accepts a list 'a' containing n integers, where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list. It counts how many times each integer appears in the list and stores these counts in a dictionary. Then, it calculates the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice and returns this count.
