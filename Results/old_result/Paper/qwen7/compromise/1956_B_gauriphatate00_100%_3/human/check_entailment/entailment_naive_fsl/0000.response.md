Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not simulate the game correctly. According to the problem description, Nene always selects cards optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only counts how many pairs of cards you have, which does not reflect Nene's optimal strategy.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the current program outputs:
```
2
```

This happens because the program simply counts the number of pairs in your hand, which is 2 in this case. But according to the problem description, Nene would always choose a card that maximizes her score and minimizes yours. In this scenario, Nene would first pick one of the 1's, then you would pick the other 1, and Nene would then pick one of the 2's, and you would pick the last 3. Thus, you would only get 1 point.

Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy of Nene, making it incorrect.
