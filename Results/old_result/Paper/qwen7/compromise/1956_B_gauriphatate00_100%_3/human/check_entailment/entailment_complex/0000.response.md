Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Maximum Score:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. However, this does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.
   - According to the problem, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. This means that Nene will try to force you to get as few points as possible by playing optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy Consideration Missing:**
   - The function does not consider the optimal strategy of Nene. For example, if you have two cards with the same number, Nene would play one of those cards immediately to prevent you from scoring a point on your next turn.
   - The function only checks if a number appears exactly twice and counts it towards your score, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - In the first test case, the output should be 1, but the function incorrectly outputs 2 because it counts the numbers that appear exactly twice without considering Nene's optimal strategy.
   - In the second test case, the output should be 2, but the function incorrectly outputs 0 because it does not account for Nene's optimal strategy.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
