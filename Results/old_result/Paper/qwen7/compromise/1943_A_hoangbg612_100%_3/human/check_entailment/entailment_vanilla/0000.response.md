Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for finding the game's final score based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is unnecessary since the sorting operation does not affect the logic for determining the MEX value directly. Sorting can be removed without affecting the correctness.

3. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`. This will be used to keep track of the current highest number that can be excluded.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number in `N`.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number.
   - It checks if the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means we have found a gap and can increment `cur` by 1.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and increments its count in `M`.
   - This part of the code seems to be trying to find the smallest missing number in a sequence, but it does not fully account for the game rules where Alice and Bob take turns.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`. If true, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` where the count is 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second key in `cnt`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The logic for finding the MEX is flawed. The program does not properly simulate the game's turns and does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob take turns.
   - The program assumes that the smallest missing number can be found by simply counting occurrences, which is not accurate for the game's rules.

2. **Game Rules Not Implemented:**
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Alice always picks from the original array, and Bob removes elements from the array after Alice's turn.
   - The MEX calculation should consider the sequence of moves and the resulting array `c` after all turns are completed.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the game's final score based on the problem description. It fails to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not accurately calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

**Correctness: **False**
