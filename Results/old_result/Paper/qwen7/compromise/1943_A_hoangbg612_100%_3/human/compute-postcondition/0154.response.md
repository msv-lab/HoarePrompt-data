Postcondition: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is either `cur` or `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
