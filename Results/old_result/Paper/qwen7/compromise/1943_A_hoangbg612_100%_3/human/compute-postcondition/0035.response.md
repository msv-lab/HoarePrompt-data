Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 and set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1 and sets it to 1. Since `cur` is equal to `num` in the initial state, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 and then set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
