The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. This operation does not affect the list `N`, the dictionary `M`, or the sum `S`. The only change is that `cur` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`cur` is the highest value in the list `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur - 1` plus 1, the dictionary `M` remains with entries where the key is the value of `cur` at the point when it was last updated (either directly by setting `cur = num` or incremented by 1), and for each key, the value is the count of numbers in `N` that are either equal to the key or fall within the range `[cur - 1, cur]`. The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.**
