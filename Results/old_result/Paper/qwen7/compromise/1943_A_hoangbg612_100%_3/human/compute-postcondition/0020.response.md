Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `num` is an element from the list `N`.
   - `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`.
   - If `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1.
   - `N` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is an index in the list `N`.
   - `M[cur]` is incremented based on the condition involving `num` and `cur`.
   - If `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1.
   - `N` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is taken from `N`, the next `num` will be the next element in `N`.
   - `cur` will be updated based on the condition `num > cur + 1`.
   - `N` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `N` must contain at least one element.
   - `cur` will be updated to either its current value (if `num <= cur + 1`) or `cur + 1` (if `num > cur + 1`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cur` is an index in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`, if `num > cur + 1` then `cur` is increased by 1, `N` must contain at least one element, and `num` will be the next element in `N`**.
