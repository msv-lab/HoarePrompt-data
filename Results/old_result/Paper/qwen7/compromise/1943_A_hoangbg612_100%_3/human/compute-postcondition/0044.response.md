Output State: **`cur` will be the highest value in the list `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur - 1`, the dictionary `M` will have entries where the key is the value of `cur` at the point when it was last updated, and for each key, the value is the count of numbers in `N` that are either equal to the key or fall within the range `[cur - 1, cur]`, the sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, `cnt` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = []` initializes an empty list named `cnt`. This does not affect the values of `cur`, `M`, or `S`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the new empty list `cnt`.
