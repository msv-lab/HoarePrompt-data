Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, and `cur` is equal to the original value of `cur` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `num` is still greater than `cur + 1`, and `cur` is now one more than its original value.
