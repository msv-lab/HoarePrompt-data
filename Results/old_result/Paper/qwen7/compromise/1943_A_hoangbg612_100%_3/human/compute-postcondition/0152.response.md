Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is either `cur` or `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `cur` + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement it is inside. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the given code snippet, the values of `T`, `M`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain as they were in the initial state.
