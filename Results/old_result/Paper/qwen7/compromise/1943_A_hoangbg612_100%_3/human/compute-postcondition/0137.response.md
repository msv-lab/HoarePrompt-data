Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `cur` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `num`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `M` now contains one key-value pair where the key is `cur` and the value is 1. The other conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
