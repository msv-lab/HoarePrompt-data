Output State: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where each key is an integer from the list `N` and each value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer as determined by the loop, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is the last integer processed in the loop, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `T` will still be greater than 0, `M` will be a dictionary showing how many times each number appeared consecutively in the original list `N`, `cnt` will include all numbers that originally had a count of 1 in `M`, `cur` will be the last number processed, and `N` will be empty because all elements have been processed.
