Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, and `cur` is equal to the original value of `cur` plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly mentioned, the `break` statement implies that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional structure we were inside. The values of `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
