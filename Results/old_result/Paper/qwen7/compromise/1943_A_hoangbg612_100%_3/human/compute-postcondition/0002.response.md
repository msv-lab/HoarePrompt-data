Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `S` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `S` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The value of `T` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `T` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), and `S` now holds the integer input provided by the user.
