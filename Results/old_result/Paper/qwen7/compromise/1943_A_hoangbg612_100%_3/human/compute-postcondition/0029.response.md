Postcondition: `cur` is an index in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`. If `num > cur`, `cur` is increased by 1. If `num > cur - 1` or `num <= cur`, `M[cur-1]` is incremented by 1 and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 and `cur` remains unchanged if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`.
