Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[cur-1]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur-1` or `num <= cur`, and `M[cur]` is set to 1, if `num > cur + 1` then `cur` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M[cur]` (which is `M[num]`) is set to 1. The conditions for incrementing `M[cur-1]` remain the same as before, and if `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` is increased by 1.
