Output State: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in `N`, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `M` will contain each unique integer from the original list `N` as a key, with its value being the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer. The variable `cur` will hold the last integer from the list `N` that was processed, and `N` itself will be empty as all elements have been iterated over.
