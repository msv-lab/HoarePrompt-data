Postcondition: **`N` is a list containing all elements except the one that was just processed (which is `num`), `cur` is either equal to `num` or the next element in the updated list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. The most internal loop or if statement is not broken if `num > cur + 1`, otherwise, it continues based on the value of `cur`.**
