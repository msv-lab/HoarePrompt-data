Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is -1, and `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `num` if `num > cur`, otherwise `cur` is -1, and `N` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is either `cur` or `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `num` if `num > cur`, otherwise `cur` is -1, and `N` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces with one less element than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is either `cur` or `num` and the value is either 1 or 2, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `num` if `num > cur`, otherwise `cur` is -1, and `N` must contain at least one element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
