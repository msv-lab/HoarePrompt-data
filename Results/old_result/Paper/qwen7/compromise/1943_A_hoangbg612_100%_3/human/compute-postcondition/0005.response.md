Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cur` to -1. This does not affect the values of `T`, `S`, or `N`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
