Based on the initial state provided:

- After all iterations of the loop have finished, the dictionary `M` no longer contains any keys with a value of 1.
- The list `cnt` contains all the keys from the dictionary `M` that satisfied the condition `M[k] == 1` during the loop's execution.
- The length of the list `cnt` is at least 2.
- The variable `cur` is equal to the second element in the list `cnt`.

The `print(cur)` statement will print the second element of the list `cnt`.

Output: **the second element in the list cnt**
