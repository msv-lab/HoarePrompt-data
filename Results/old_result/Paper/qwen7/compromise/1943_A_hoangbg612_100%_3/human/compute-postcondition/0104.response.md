Output State: **`cur` is equal to the last element in the original list `N` plus 1; `M` contains each unique element from `N` as a key with its corresponding count as the value; the sum of all counts in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`; `cnt` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = []` initializes an empty list named `cnt`. This operation does not affect the values of `cur`, `M`, or `S`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as per the initial state, and `cnt` is now an empty list.
