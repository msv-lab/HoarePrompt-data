Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is either `cur` or `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is now equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. All other variables (`T`, `M`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
