Postcondition: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is a list containing all unique keys from the original dictionary `M` that had a value of 1, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cur` is the second element in the list `cnt`.
