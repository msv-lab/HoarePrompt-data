Output State: **`N` contains at least one element, the current value of `num` is greater than the current value of `cur` plus 1, `cur` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The conditions and the state of `N` and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, `N` still contains at least one element, `num` is still greater than `cur + 1`, and `cur` is now increased by 1.
