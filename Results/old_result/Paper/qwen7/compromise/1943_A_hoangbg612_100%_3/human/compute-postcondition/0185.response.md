Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the dictionary `M` will be empty, as all entries with a value of 1 will have been processed. The list `cnt` will contain all unique keys from the original dictionary `M` that had a value of 1 during the loop's execution. The variable `cur` will be set to the second smallest key in the list `cnt` if the list has at least two elements; otherwise, `cur` will be -1 (or undefined, depending on how the code handles an empty `cnt` list). The variable `T` will be 0, indicating that all input integers have been processed.

In simpler terms, after running the loop through all iterations, `M` will be empty because all its entries with a count of 1 will have been removed. `cnt` will hold all the unique keys that appeared exactly once in any of the input lists `N`. `cur` will be the second smallest number in `cnt` if `cnt` has more than one element; otherwise, `cur` will be undefined or -1. Also, `T` will be 0, showing that there are no more inputs to process.
