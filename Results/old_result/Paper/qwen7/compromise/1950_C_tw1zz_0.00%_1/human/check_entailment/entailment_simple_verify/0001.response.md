### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input string `hh:mm` into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).

2. **Conversion Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to determine the 12-hour equivalent for the hour part (`h`).
   - For hours from 01 to 12, it directly assigns the 12-hour equivalent.
   - For hours from 13 to 23, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the `time` to "PM".
   - For hour 00, it correctly sets the 12-hour equivalent to 12 and the `time` to "PM".

3. **Issues with the Provided Solution:**
   - While the logic appears to cover most cases, it is indeed overly verbose and can be simplified.
   - The use of multiple `if-elif` statements can be replaced with a more concise approach using modulo arithmetic.
   - The current implementation handles the edge case for `00` correctly, but the overall structure is not as efficient as it could be.

4. **Simplified Correct Implementation:**
   - Using modulo arithmetic, we can simplify the conversion logic.
   - The modulo operation `% 12` will give us the 12-hour equivalent for any hour from 0 to 23.
   - We can then check if the hour is less than 12 to determine whether it is "AM" or "PM".

Here is a simplified version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = str((int(h) % 12) or 12)  # Convert 24-hour to 12-hour format
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')
```

This simplified version:
- Uses modulo arithmetic to handle the conversion.
- Correctly sets "AM" or "PM" based on the hour.
- Handles all edge cases correctly, including `00`.

### Conclusion:

While the original implementation is correct in terms of functionality, it is overly verbose and can be simplified. The provided solution, although correct, is not as efficient as it could be. However, the core logic and handling of edge cases are correct.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct, even though it can be simplified further.
