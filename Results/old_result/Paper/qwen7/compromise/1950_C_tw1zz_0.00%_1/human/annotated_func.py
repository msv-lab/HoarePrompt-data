#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1:mm AM/PM". The specific times printed will depend on the input provided during the loop executions. For each input "hh:mm", the code converts "hh" to the 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" accordingly, then prints the result.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple time inputs in the 24-hour format and converts them to the 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of time inputs to process, followed by `t` lines of time inputs in the format "hh:mm". For each input, it converts the hour part to the 12-hour format and appends the appropriate AM/PM designation, then prints the converted time. The final state consists of `t` lines of output, each displaying a time in the format "h1:mm AM/PM".
