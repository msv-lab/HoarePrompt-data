### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem statement carefully.

1. **Problem Statement Analysis:**
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The provided solution counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and uses a formula to compute the result.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters (`neg`) in the string `s`.
   - It calculates the result using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1()` correctly counts the number of '-' characters and applies the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

4. **Optimality Consideration:**
   - The key issue is whether the formula `n - 2 * neg` always gives the minimum possible penalty.
   - To determine this, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     - For `s = "-----"` (length 5), the formula gives `5 - 2 * 5 = -5`, but the correct answer should be 5 (splitting into `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]` results in a penalty of 0).
     - For `s = "--+++++++-"` (length 10), the formula gives `10 - 2 * 8 = 2`, but the correct answer should be 0 (splitting into `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]` results in a penalty of 0).

From these examples, it is clear that the formula `n - 2 * neg` does not always yield the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for the actual values and arrangement of the array `a` and their impact on the penalty calculation.
