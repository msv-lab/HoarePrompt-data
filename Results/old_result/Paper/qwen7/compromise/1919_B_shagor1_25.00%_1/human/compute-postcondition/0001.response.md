Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n, and `s` is assigned the value of input from the user.**

The code `s = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n, after executing the code, `s` will be updated to the input string provided by the user, while `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
