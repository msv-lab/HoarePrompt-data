Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n, `neg` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `neg` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
