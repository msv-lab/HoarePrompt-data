Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from stdin, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `a` remains unchanged as a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**

The code reads a line of input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is not affected by this operation.
