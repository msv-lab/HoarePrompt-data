Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable here is `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `n`.

2. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**: Since the loop head only contains `n`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

3. **Understand the initial state**: The initial state is given as follows:
   - `cnt` is increased by the sum of all values in `v`.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v` is a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. This is because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive), and if `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not run at all.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
