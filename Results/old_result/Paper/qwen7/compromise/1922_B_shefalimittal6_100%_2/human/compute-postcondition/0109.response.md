Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of all values in `v`, `ans` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `t` must be greater than 0**.

This means that the variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[idx])`, which is an integer extracted from the `data` list at index `idx`. All other variables retain their previous states.
