Output State: **`ans` is updated to ans + cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2, `cnt` is updated to the next value of v, `i` is updated to 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `i` starts at 1, the first iteration updates `ans` with `v[1]`. After updating `ans`, `cnt` is set to the next value in the list `v`, which is `v[2]`, and `i` is incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
