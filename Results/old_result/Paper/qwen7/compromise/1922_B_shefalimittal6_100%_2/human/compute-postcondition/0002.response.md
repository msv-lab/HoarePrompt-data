Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from stdin, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `idx` is 0, and `a` remains unchanged as a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables (`data`, `t`, `n`, and `a`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as their initial conditions.
