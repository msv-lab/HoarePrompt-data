Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is `v[0]`, and `ans` is increased by `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its current value. Given that `i` is 2, the expression becomes `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6`. The values of `i`, `n`, `cnt`, and the updated `ans` are as described.
