Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, but since it's a placeholder and not used in the loop, we don't need to consider it for adjusting the state.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. 

3. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state before the loop is:
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `results` contains a single string which is the str representation of `ans`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `ans` is the cumulative sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each `i` from `0` to `n`.
   - `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` up to the `n`-th element.
   - `t` is decreased by 1.
   - `v` is now a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. All other variables (`idx`, `data`, `results`, `ans`, `cnt`, `t`, and `v`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
