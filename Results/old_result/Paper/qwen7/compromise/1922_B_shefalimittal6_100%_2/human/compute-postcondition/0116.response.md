Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is a variable in the loop head, it directly affects the loop's continuation.

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, and no other variables in the loop head affect the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 0. Additionally, since `idx` and `v[x]` are not part of the loop head, their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `n` must still be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
