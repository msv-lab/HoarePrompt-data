Output State: **`ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `n` is `idx - 1`, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Here, `i` is 0, and the condition that `v[i]` (which is `v[0]`) is greater than or equal to 2 is met. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state.
