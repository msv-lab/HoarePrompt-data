Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from stdin, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `idx` is 2, and `a` remains unchanged as a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
