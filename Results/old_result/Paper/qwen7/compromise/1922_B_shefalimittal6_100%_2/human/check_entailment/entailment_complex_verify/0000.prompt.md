You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain a list of strings where each string represents the value of `ans` calculated for each of the `t` iterations. The variable `n` will be equal to the last index processed (`idx - 1`), `cnt` will be the total count of all occurrences across all lists `v` for each iteration, and `ans` will hold the final accumulated result from performing the specified calculations over all iterations.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the string representations of `ans` for each iteration, separated by newlines
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of non-negative integers \( a \) (of size \( n \)). For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the frequency of elements in the list \( a \) and stores the result as a string in a list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each result separated by a newline.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. However, the program only counts the number of ways to choose three sticks without checking if they can form a triangle.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3
1 1 1
```

The correct output should be `1` because there is only one way to choose three sticks (all three sticks), and they can form a degenerate triangle (a straight line). However, the program will output `3` because it simply counts the number of ways to choose three sticks without verifying the triangle inequality condition.

To fix this, the program needs to check the triangle inequality condition for each combination of three sticks. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = [int(data[idx + i]) for i in range(n)]
        idx += n
        cnt = 0
        for comb in combinations(a, 3):
            if comb[0] + comb[1] > comb[2] and comb[0] + comb[2] > comb[1] and comb[1] + comb[2] > comb[0]:
                cnt += 1
        results.append(str(cnt))
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected version uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three sticks and checks the triangle inequality condition for each combination.
