### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach when dealing with large inputs.
   
2. **Parsing Test Cases**: It iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary values (`n` and the array `a`). This part seems correct.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: For each test case, it counts how many times each value appears in the array `a`. This is stored in the list `v`.

4. **Triangle Formation Logic**:
   - To form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - The program calculates the number of valid combinations of three sticks that can form a triangle using combinatorial logic.
   - Specifically, it checks:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to pick 2 out of these sticks and pairs them with any other stick.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to pick 3 out of these sticks.
   - The logic for counting combinations is correct.

5. **Combination Calculations**:
   - The formula used to count combinations is correct:
     - `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for pairs.
     - `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for triplets.
   - These formulas correctly compute the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 items from a set of identical items.

6. **Output**: The results are printed in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the implementation.

### Correctness:
**True**
