Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for char in expression:`. The variables involved here are `char` and `expression`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `char`: This variable will take on each character from the string `expression` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `expression`: This is the string that the loop will iterate over.

3. **Initial state given**:
   - `count` is 0
   - `balance` is 0
   - `length` is an integer representing the length of the string expression

4. **Condition for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, the string `expression` must contain at least one character. If `expression` is an empty string, the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `char` will take on each character from `expression`, we need to ensure that `expression` is not an empty string.
   - We don't need to adjust `count`, `balance`, or `length` as they are not part of the loop head and their values are already given.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `expression` must be a non-empty string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`expression` must be a non-empty string**
