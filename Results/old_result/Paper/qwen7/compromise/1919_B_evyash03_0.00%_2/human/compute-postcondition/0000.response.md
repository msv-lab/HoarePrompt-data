Output State: **`count` is 0, length is an integer representing the length of the string expression.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. The length of the string `expression` and its composition of characters "+" and "-" remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `length` is still an integer representing the length of the string `expression`, and `count` is now explicitly set to 0.
