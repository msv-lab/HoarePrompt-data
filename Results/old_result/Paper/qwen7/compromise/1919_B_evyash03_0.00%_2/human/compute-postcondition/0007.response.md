Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of '+' and '-' characters and an integer `length` representing the length of `expression`. It counts the number of times the balance (initially set to 0) goes below zero while iterating through each character in `expression`. If the final balance is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the count. The function returns this final count.**
