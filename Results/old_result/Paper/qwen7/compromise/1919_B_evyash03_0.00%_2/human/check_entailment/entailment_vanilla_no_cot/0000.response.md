Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of segments where the balance goes negative, but it does not calculate the penalty as required by the problem statement. Specifically, the function does not compute the penalty based on the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by its length.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should:
1. Split the string into segments based on '-' characters.
2. For each segment, calculate the penalty as `abs(sum(segment)) * len(segment)`.
3. Sum these penalties to get the total penalty.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    parts = ['']
    for char in expression:
        if char == '-':
            parts.append('')
        parts[-1] += char
    result = 0
    for part in parts:
        if part:
            sum_part = sum(1 if c == '+' else -1 for c in part)
            penalty = abs(sum_part) * len(part)
            result += penalty
    print(result)
```

This corrected version correctly splits the string into segments, calculates the penalty for each segment, and sums these penalties to get the final result.
