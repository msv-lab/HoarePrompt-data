### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not solve the problem as stated. Let's break down why the provided solution is incorrect and how we can improve it.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance goes negative but does not compute the actual penalty as described in the problem statement. The penalty is the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays multiplied by their lengths.

2. **Misunderstanding of the Problem:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the optimal splitting strategy to minimize the penalty. Instead, it focuses on counting splits where the balance is negative, which is not the same as minimizing the penalty.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the array is split in such a way that the penalty is minimized. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

1. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - Maintain a running sum (`balance`) and a count of splits (`count`).
   - Whenever the balance becomes zero, it indicates a potential optimal split point.

2. **Calculate the Penalty:**
   - For each split, calculate the penalty as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.
   - Sum these penalties to get the total penalty.

Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    balance = 0
    count = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_penalty = float('inf')

    for i, char in enumerate(expression):
        if char == '+':
            current_sum += 1
        else:
            current_sum -= 1
        
        if current_sum == 0:
            # Calculate the penalty for this subarray
            penalty = abs(current_sum) * (i - count + 1)
            min_penalty = min(min_penalty, penalty)
            count = i + 1
            current_sum = 0

    # Handle the last subarray
    if current_sum != 0:
        penalty = abs(current_sum) * (len(expression) - count + 1)
        min_penalty = min(min_penalty, penalty)

    print(min_penalty)
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `balance` keeps track of the cumulative sum of the subarray.
   - `count` keeps track of the start index of the current subarray.
   - `min_penalty` stores the minimum penalty found so far.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each character, update the `current_sum` based on whether it is `'+'` or `'-'`.
   - When `current_sum` becomes zero, it means we have found a subarray whose sum is zero. Calculate the penalty for this subarray and update `min_penalty`.

3. **Handle the Last Subarray:**
   - After the loop, handle the last subarray if `current_sum` is not zero.

This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array optimally.

### Final Evaluation

Given the corrected approach, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the provided solution. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
