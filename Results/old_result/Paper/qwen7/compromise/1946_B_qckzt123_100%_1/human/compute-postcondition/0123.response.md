Output State: **`i` is 1; `t` is 4 % MOD; `ans` is 2 % MOD; `t` is updated to 4 % MOD**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. Given that `t` is initially `4 % MOD`, the operation does not change the value of `t` since `4 % MOD` is already `4 % MOD`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged.
