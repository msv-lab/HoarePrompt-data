Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` is max(0, `t`), `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element, `s` is the sum of all remaining elements in list `a`**

Explanation: The code `t = max(tmp, t)` updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` (which is 0) and `t`. Since `tmp` is 0, `t` remains unchanged unless `t` was less than 0 before this line of code. However, since `t` is initially set to `max(0, t)`, it is already non-negative. Therefore, `t` does not change. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
