Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `x` is the first element in the list `a`.
   - `tmp` is equal to 0.
   - `t` is equal to `max(0, t)`.

3. **Determine the changes for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the first element in the list `a`, after the first iteration, `x` will be set to the second element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains the same unless it is modified within the loop body, but since no modification to `a` is mentioned, we assume `a` stays the same.
   - `tmp` and `t` are not directly affected by the loop head, so their values remain unchanged for now.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `a` remains the same (a list of integers with at least one element).
   - `x` becomes the second element in the list `a`.
   - `tmp` remains 0.
   - `t` remains `max(0, t)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `tmp` is equal to 0, `t` is equal to `max(0, t)`**
