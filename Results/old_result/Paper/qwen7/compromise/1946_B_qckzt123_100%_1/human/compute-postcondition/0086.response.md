Output State: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than `k-1`, `t` is \(2^{k-1} \mod \text{MOD}\), `ans` is the cumulative sum of terms \(t\) from \(2^0 \mod \text{MOD}\) to \(2^{k-1} \mod \text{MOD}\) modulo `MOD`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `k-1`, `k` must be greater than `k-1` (which is always true since `k` does not change within the loop), `t` will be \(2^{k-1} \mod \text{MOD}\) because it doubles in each iteration starting from 2, and `ans` will be the sum of all `t` values from the start of the loop up to the final value of `t`, all taken modulo `MOD`.
