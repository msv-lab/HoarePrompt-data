Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of `tmp` and the third element in `a`, and `t` is equal to `max(tmp, t)`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments `tmp` by the value of `x`, which is the third element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `tmp` is now the sum of its previous value and `x`, and `t` remains as the maximum of its previous value and `tmp`.
