Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

The code initializes two new variables `t` and `tmp` with the value `0`. The values of the existing variables `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
