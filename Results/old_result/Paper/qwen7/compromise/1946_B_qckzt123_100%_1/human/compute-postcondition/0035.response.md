Output State: **`ans` is `ans` modulo `MOD`, `t` is `t % MOD`, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `k` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be `ans` modulo `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, or `k`. Therefore, the updated state of `ans` is its value modulo `MOD`, while `t`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
