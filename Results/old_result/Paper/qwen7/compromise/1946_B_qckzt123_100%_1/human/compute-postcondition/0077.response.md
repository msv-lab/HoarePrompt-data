Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 2, `t` is 4 % MOD, `ans` is `ans` % MOD, `t` is equal to `t` % MOD**

The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t` modulo `MOD`. Since the initial value of `t` is `4 % MOD`, after executing the code, `t` remains `4 % MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation.
