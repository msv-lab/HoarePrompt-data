Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is 0, and `t` is equal to `max(x, t)`**.

Explanation: The code initializes `tmp` to 0, which overrides the previous value of `tmp`. Since `tmp` was previously the sum of itself and the third element in the list `a`, it is now reset to 0. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is the third element in the list `a`. The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x`.
