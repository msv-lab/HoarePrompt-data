Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers read from input, `ans` is the sum of `t` which starts at 0 and doubles each iteration until it reaches \(2^{k-1} - 1\) modulo `MOD`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` remains the same as its initial value, `T` must be greater than 0, and `s` is the sum of the elements in list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `t` which starts at 0 and doubles each iteration until it reaches \(2^{k-1} - 1\) modulo `MOD`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` remains the same as its initial value, `T` must be greater than 0, and `s` is the sum of the elements in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `t` which starts at 0 and doubles each iteration until it reaches \(2^{k-1} - 1\) modulo `MOD`, `t` is equal to `max(tmp, t)`, `tmp` is 0, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` remains the same as its initial value, `T` must be greater than 0, and `s` is the sum of the elements in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is the third element of the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `t` which starts at 0 and doubles each iteration until it reaches \(2^{k-1} - 1\) modulo `MOD`, `t` is equal to `max(tmp, t)` and remains unchanged since `tmp` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` remains the same as its initial value, `T` must be greater than 0, and `s` is the sum of the elements in list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
