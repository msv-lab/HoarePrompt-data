Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after performing the specified operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the sum `s` of the array and calculates the maximum prefix sum `t`. This ensures that any negative contributions are ignored, and only positive contributions are considered.

2. **First Operation**: The initial value of `t` is added to `s`, which gives the best possible sum after the first operation.

3. **Subsequent Operations**: For each additional operation, the program doubles the current maximum sum (`t`), ensuring that the sum grows exponentially. This is optimal because each new subarray sum can be added multiple times, contributing to the maximum possible sum.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large sums, which is necessary according to the problem statement.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the operations, the program handles all potential cases correctly. It accounts for both positive and negative elements in the array and maximizes the sum through repeated doubling of the prefix sum. Therefore, the program is correct.
