### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice picks elements and appends them to her array `c`, then removes them from `a`.
   - Bob picks elements and removes them from `a` without appending.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code provided does not correctly implement the game logic.
   - It uses functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not relevant to the game logic and are commented out.
   - The function `func_1` is defined but does not correctly simulate the game or calculate the MEX.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX by ensuring that as many numbers as possible are included in `c`.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX by preventing Alice from including certain numbers in `c`.
   - The key observation is that Alice can always include at least one instance of each number from `0` to `n-1` in `c` if they exist in `a`.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Count the frequency of each number in `a`.
   - If any number appears exactly once, Alice can include it in `c`.
   - If no number appears exactly once, the MEX will be `0` because Alice cannot include any number that is missing.

5. **Provided Code Analysis:**
   - The provided code attempts to count frequencies but does not handle the game logic correctly.
   - It prints the first number that appears exactly once, which is not the correct approach.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code shows that `func_1` counts the frequency of each number in the array `arr`.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` only prints the first number that appears exactly once, which is not the correct approach to finding the MEX.
   - The code does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns, and it does not ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX or Bob minimizes it.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or calculate the MEX. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Response:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
