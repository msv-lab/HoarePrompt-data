Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as required. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find the MEX of the array `arr` directly, which does not align with the game rules.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
0
0
```

This is incorrect because:
- In the first test case, the optimal strategy would involve Alice picking elements such that the resulting array `c` has a MEX of 2, not 0.
- In the second test case, the optimal strategy would result in a MEX of 1, not 0.
- In the third test case, the optimal strategy would result in a MEX of 0, but the program incorrectly outputs 0.

The program fails to account for the alternating turns and the strategic choices made by both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
