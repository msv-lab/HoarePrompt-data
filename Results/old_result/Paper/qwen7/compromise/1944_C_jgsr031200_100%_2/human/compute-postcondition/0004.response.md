Output State: **`cou` is 0, `freq` is a list where each index `i` (where \(0 \le i < n\)) contains the count of how many times `i` appears in the original list `arr`. All other elements in `freq` up to index `n` are still zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cou` to 0. This does not affect the values of `freq` or the original list `arr`. Therefore, the only change is that `cou` is now set to 0, while `freq` remains unchanged from its initial state.
