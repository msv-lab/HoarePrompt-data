Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is an element from the list `arr`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, the initial value of `i` can be any of the elements in `arr`.

3. **Determine the State of `arr`**: The list `arr` contains non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\). The length of the list is \(n\), and \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty. Additionally, since `i` will take on each value from `arr` during the loop iterations, we don't need to specify an exact initial value for `i` but rather ensure that `arr` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final State:**
State: **`arr` must contain at least one element**
