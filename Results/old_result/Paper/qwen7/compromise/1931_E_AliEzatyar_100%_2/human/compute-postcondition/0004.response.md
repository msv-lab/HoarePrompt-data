Output State: **`counter` is 1, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, and the length of `num` is at least 1, and the current value of `num[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`num` and its current digit value) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
