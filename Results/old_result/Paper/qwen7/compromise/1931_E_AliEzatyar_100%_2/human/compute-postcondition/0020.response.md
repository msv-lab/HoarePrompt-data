Output State: The value of `counter` will be equal to the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`, and `num` will remain an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\).

Explanation: The loop iterates over the characters of `num` from the end to the beginning. It increments `counter` each time it encounters a '0'. Once it encounters a non-zero digit, it breaks out of the loop. Therefore, after the loop completes, `counter` will hold the count of trailing zeros in `num`. The value of `num` itself does not change during the loop's execution.
