Output State: **`counter` is either 2 or 3, `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\), and the length of `num` is at least 1, and the character `num[i]` is '0', where `i` is `len(num) - 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. Since `counter` was either 1 or 2, it now becomes either 2 or 3. The values of `num` and its properties remain unchanged.
