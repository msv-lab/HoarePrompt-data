Postcondition: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\), and the length of `num` is at least 1, and the character `num[i]` is '0', where `i` is `len(num) - 3`. After the if-else block executes, if `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `counter` remains either 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
