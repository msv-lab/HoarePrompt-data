Postcondition: **All variables remain unchanged except for `j` which equals `n`, `reachable_second_row` which is `True`, and `reachable_first_row` which remains in its last known state based on the conditions evaluated during the loop's final iteration. The current value of `reachable_second_row` is `True`.**
