Output State: **results is ['YES'], reachable_second_row is True, reachable_first_row is in its last known state based on the conditions evaluated during the loop's final iteration.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially empty, after appending `'YES'`, it contains only one element, `'YES'`. The variables `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain unchanged from their previous states. `reachable_second_row` is explicitly stated to be `True`, and `reachable_first_row` retains its state from the loop's final iteration.
