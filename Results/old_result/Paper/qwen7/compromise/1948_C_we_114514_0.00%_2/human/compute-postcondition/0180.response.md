Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, `j` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>' with `j` being equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, or the value of `row2[j]`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
