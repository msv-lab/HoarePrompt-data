Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, `j` is 0, `n` must be a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, the condition `reachable_first_row` is true, and the value of `row1[j]` is '>'**.

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` sets the variable `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, and `row1[j]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
