Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `test_case`, which is being iterated over from the `test_cases` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of `test_case`**: At the start of the loop, `test_case` will take on the values from the `test_cases` list one by one.

3. **Understand the constraints and requirements**:
   - Each `test_case` is a list containing three elements: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly `n` characters that are either '<' or '>'.
   - The `test_cases` list itself is not directly involved in the loop head, but its contents are.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `test_case` is a list, the first element of `test_case` (which is `n`) must be within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even).
   - The second and third elements of `test_case` (the two strings) must consist of exactly `n` characters, and each character must be either '<' or '>'.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the first element of `test_case` is within the required range and that the second and third elements are valid strings as described.

**State after adjustment**:
- `results` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `test_cases` is a list of valid test cases, meaning each `test_case` in `test_cases` must satisfy the conditions mentioned above.

Since the loop will iterate over each `test_case` in `test_cases`, we need to ensure that the first element of each `test_case` is within the required range and that the second and third elements are valid strings.

**Final State**:
State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test_case in `test_cases` is a list where the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and the second and third elements are strings consisting of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'**
