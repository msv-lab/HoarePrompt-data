Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>', and the program does nothing as the condition `j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>'` is not specified to change any variables in the if part, hence the variables retain their initial values.
