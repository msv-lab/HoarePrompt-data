Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, and the condition `reachable_first_row` is true if and only if `row1[0] == '>',` otherwise `reachable_first_row` is false. If `reachable_first_row` is true, then `reachable_second_row` is also true. If `reachable_first_row` is false, then `reachable_second_row` is true if `row2[0] == '>'`, or remains false if `row2[0] != '>'`.
