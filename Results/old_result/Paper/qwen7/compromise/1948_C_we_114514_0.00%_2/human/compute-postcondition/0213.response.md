Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_second_row` is `True`**.

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` sets the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `reachable_second_row` is updated to `True`.
