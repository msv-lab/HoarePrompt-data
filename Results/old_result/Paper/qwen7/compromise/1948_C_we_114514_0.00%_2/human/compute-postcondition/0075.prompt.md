Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, results is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test_case in `test_cases` is a list where the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and the second and third elements are strings consisting of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>', regardless of the comparison result with `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 1, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>', regardless of whether `j` equals `n - 1` or not, and if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, no changes are made; otherwise, the conditions remain as initially stated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>', regardless of whether `j` equals `n-1` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
