Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`, depending on whether the conditions within the loop were met for each test case.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- For each test case, the variable `reachable_second_row` will determine if the loop concluded with a 'YES' or 'NO'.
- If `reachable_second_row` is `True` for any given test case, the corresponding entry in the `results` list will be 'YES'. Otherwise, it will be 'NO'.
- The value of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will be determined by the logic within the loop based on the characters in `row1` and `row2`.
- The variable `j` will be equal to `n - 1` for the last iteration of the loop for each test case.
- The variable `t` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final `results` list will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`, reflecting whether the specified conditions were met for the entire grid represented by `row1` and `row2` for each test case.
