Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list.
   - `reachable_first_row` is false.
   - `reachable_second_row` is true.
   - The current value of `row2[0]` is '>'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is an input to the loop and does not change within the loop body.
   - The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, and `row2[0]` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>'**.
