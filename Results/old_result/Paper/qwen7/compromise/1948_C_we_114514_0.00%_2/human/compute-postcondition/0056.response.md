Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>'**.

The code simply reassigns `reachable_second_row` to `True`, which does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, or the value of `row2[0]`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values.
