Output State: **`counter` is 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of boxes, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', where `s1[i] = '1'` if there is a cat in the i-th box initially, and `s2[i] = '1'` if there should be a cat in the i-th box according to the desired state.**

The code initializes the variable `counter` to 0. No changes are made to the values of `n`, `s1`, or `s2`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
