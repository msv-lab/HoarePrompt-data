Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array can be sorted using the specified operations.
2. The main loop iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the array and then tries to sort it by repeatedly applying the operation to elements greater than or equal to 10.
3. However, the implementation of the operation within the loop has several issues:
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is sorted, but it is called before any operations are applied, which means it does not reflect the changes made during the loop.
   - The operation to split the digits of an element is not correctly implemented. The code does not actually split the digits and insert them back into the list.
   - The logic to check and apply the operation is flawed. It should only attempt to split an element if it is greater than or equal to 10 and is out of order with the previous element, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.
4. The final check with `func_1` after the loop is also incorrect because it checks the original list, not the modified one.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
