Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not used properly**: The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted but does not account for the operations allowed in the problem. This function should be modified to simulate the allowed operations and check if the array can be sorted through these operations.

2. **Incorrect logic for applying operations**: The logic inside the loop that applies the operations is flawed. It only checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and the previous element is greater than 10, then splits the previous element. However, it does not ensure that the array can be fully sorted through these operations.

3. **Missing implementation of the main logic**: The core logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements into their digits is missing. The current implementation does not handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Function to split a number into its digits and insert them back into the list
    def split_and_insert(num, index):
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
        list1.pop(index)
        for digit in reversed(digits):
            list1.insert(index, digit)
    
    # Function to check if the array can be sorted by splitting elements
    def can_sort():
        while True:
            sorted_list = sorted(list1)
            if list1 == sorted_list:
                return True
            changed = False
            for j in range(len(list1)):
                if list1[j] >= 10:
                    split_and_insert(list1[j], j)
                    changed = True
            if not changed:
                break
        return list1 == sorted_list
    
    if can_sort():
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version includes:
- A function `split_and_insert` to handle the splitting and insertion of digits.
- A function `can_sort` that attempts to sort the array by repeatedly splitting elements until no more changes can be made or the array is sorted.
