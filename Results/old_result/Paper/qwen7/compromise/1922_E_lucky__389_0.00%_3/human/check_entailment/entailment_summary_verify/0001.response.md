### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The program attempts to generate such an array by breaking down `X-1` into powers of 2, which represent the lengths of segments of the array where the elements are strictly increasing.

2. **Key Logic in `func_1()`**:
   - The program subtracts 1 from `X` because the empty subsequence is not counted.
   - It then iteratively finds the largest power of 2 that fits into `X`, constructs the corresponding segment of the array, and updates `X`.
   - The segments are stored in `subseq_lens` and the maximum length among these segments is stored in `mx`.

3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The array is constructed using the lengths in `subseq_lens`. For each segment, the program appends the appropriate number of elements to the array.
   - The first segment is filled with consecutive integers starting from 0 up to `mx-1`.
   - Subsequent segments are filled with the values from `subseq_lens`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `X` is 2, the array `[0]` is generated, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`).
   - If `X` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, the program will terminate early and return `-1`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the construction of the array based on the given constraints.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case when `X` is a power of 2 properly. For example, if `X` is 4, the program will incorrectly generate an array that does not have exactly 4 increasing subsequences.
- **Incorrect Construction of the Array**: The array construction logic is flawed. The segments are not being constructed correctly to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Example 1**: For `X = 4`, the program should generate an array with exactly 4 increasing subsequences. However, the current logic will generate an array like `[0, 1, 0, 1]`, which does not have exactly 4 increasing subsequences.
- **Example 2**: For `X = 5`, the program should generate an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences. The current logic will generate an array like `[0, 1, 0, 1, 2]`, which does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences, we need to ensure that the array is constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. This can be achieved by carefully constructing the array segments to match the required number of subsequences.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
