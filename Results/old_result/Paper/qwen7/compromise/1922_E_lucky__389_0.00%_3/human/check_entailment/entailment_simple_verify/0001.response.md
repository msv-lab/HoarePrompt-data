### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The program attempts to generate such an array by breaking down `X-1` into powers of 2, which represent the lengths of segments of the array where the elements are strictly increasing.

2. **Key Logic in `func_1()`**:
   - The program subtracts 1 from `X` because the empty subsequence is not counted.
   - It then iteratively finds the largest power of 2 that fits into `X`, constructs the corresponding segment of the array, and updates `X`.
   - The segments are stored in `subseq_lens` and the maximum length among these segments is stored in `mx`.

3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The array is constructed using the lengths in `subseq_lens`. For each segment, the program appends the appropriate number of elements to the array.
   - The first segment is filled with consecutive integers starting from 0 up to `mx-1`.
   - Subsequent segments are filled with the values from `subseq_lens`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `X` is 2, the array `[0]` is generated, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`).
   - If `X` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, the program will terminate early and return `-1`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the construction of the array based on the given constraints.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of `subseq_lens` Construction**: The logic to construct `subseq_lens` is flawed. Specifically, the loop that constructs `subseq_lens` does not correctly handle the decrement of `x` and the appending of segment lengths. This can lead to incorrect values being stored in `subseq_lens`.

- **Incorrect Array Construction**: The array `ansv` is constructed by appending elements from `subseq_lens` multiple times, which does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences. The logic assumes that appending elements from `subseq_lens` twice will result in the correct number of increasing subsequences, which is not always true.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Example 1**: For `X = 13`, the expected output is `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`. The annotated code suggests that `subseq_lens` should contain `[6, 4, 4]`, but this is incorrect. The correct `subseq_lens` should be `[3, 4]`.

- **Example 2**: For `X = 37`, the expected output is `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`. The annotated code suggests that `subseq_lens` should contain `[5, 4, 4, 4]`, but this is incorrect. The correct `subseq_lens` should be `[5, 4, 3]`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. One correct approach would be to use a more systematic method to construct the array, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate due to the flaws in the logic for constructing `subseq_lens` and the array. The program does not correctly generate arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

**Correctness: **False**
