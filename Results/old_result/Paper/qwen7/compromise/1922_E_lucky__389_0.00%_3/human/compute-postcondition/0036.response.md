Output State: **`mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is at least 29, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6 and 11, `i` is 11**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 11) to the list `subseq_lens`. Initially, `subseq_lens` contains the value 6. After appending 11, `subseq_lens` will contain both 6 and 11. The values of `mx`, `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
