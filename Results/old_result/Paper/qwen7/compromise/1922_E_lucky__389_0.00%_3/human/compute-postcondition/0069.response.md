State: **`mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4, `i` is 1**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the length of `subseq_lens`.
- The length of `subseq_lens` is 3, but the loop starts from 1, so it will iterate 2 times (from index 1 to 2).
- The initial value of `i` is set to 1, which ensures the loop starts correctly.

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`, ensuring it starts from 1.

State: **`mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4, `i` is 1**
