Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^18. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided information.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes some logic involving `t` and `X`, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.
