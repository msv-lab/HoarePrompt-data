Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` must be at least 15, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 5**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The values of `mx`, `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and the condition on `t` remain unchanged.
