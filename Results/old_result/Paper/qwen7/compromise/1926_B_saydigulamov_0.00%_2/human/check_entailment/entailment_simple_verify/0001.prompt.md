You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. It is guaranteed that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is the final input integer which is one more than the last input integer provided during the loop executions, `i` is the total number of iterations (which is equal to the sum of all integers input during the loop executions), `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings `b` provided during the loop executions. The value of `b` is the last input string provided by the user, and the postcondition remains unchanged as long as the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`. However, since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be between 1 and 100, `a` will be the sum of all integers input during the loop, `i` will be the total number of iterations, `k` will contain the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings, and `b` will be the last input string. The if condition does not alter the state of `k` or `b` unless the first and second elements of `k` are equal, but even then, the state does not change due to the lack of an else part.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires determining whether a given binary grid contains a square or a triangle.
   - A square is defined by `k` consecutive rows, each containing `k` consecutive `1`s at equal distances from the left edge.
   - A triangle is defined by `k` consecutive rows, where the `i`-th row contains `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s centered in one column.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `a` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
   - For each row, it checks if there is any `1` and counts the number of `1`s in that row.
   - If the first row has `1`s, it appends the count of `1`s in that row to the list `k`.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `k`.

3. **Issues in the Given Program**:
   - The program does not check if the grid forms a square or a triangle.
   - The program only checks if the first row has `1`s and counts them, but it does not verify the pattern required for a square or a triangle.
   - The program does not handle the specific patterns required for a square or a triangle.
   - The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to identify the shapes (square or triangle) based on the grid pattern.
