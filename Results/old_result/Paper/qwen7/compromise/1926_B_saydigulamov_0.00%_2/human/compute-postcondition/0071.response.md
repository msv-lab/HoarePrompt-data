Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is the final input integer which is one more than the last input integer from the previous iterations, `i` is the total number of iterations (equal to the sum of all individual inputs for `a`), `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings `b` provided during the loop executions. The postcondition remains unchanged, meaning if the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, this equality is maintained throughout all iterations. Since the loop continues until all inputs are processed, the final state will reflect the complete aggregation of counts from all input strings that contained the character '1'.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` stays within its initial range, `a` is the sum of all individual `a` values from each iteration, `i` is the total number of iterations, and `k` contains the total count of '1's from all input strings across all iterations.
