State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `0 <= i < a` must be true.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 because it is the initial value for the loop variable `i`.
4. The variable `a` must be within the range specified (2 ≤ a ≤ 10) for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 0 and `a` being within the range 2 to 10.
