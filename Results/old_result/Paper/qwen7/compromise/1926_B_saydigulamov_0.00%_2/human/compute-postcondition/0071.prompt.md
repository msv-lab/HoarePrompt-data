Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, a is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, i is the total number of iterations (which is equal to the integer input from the user), k is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's in all the input strings b, and b and loop_count are the last input string and integer respectively. If the first and second elements of k are equal, no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is the final input integer (one more than the last input), `b` is the last input string, and `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each string `b` that contained the character '1'. If the first two elements of `k` are equal, this equality is maintained.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` is the final input string provided by the user, and `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings provided during the loop executions. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
