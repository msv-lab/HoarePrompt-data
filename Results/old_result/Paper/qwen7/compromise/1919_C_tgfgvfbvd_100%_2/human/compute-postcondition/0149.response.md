Postcondition: `a` and `b` are updated such that `a` becomes the value of `l[x+1]` and `b` becomes the value of the original `a`. `c` is increased by 1 if `a` is not greater than `b`, and `n` is greater than 0. Specifically, if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` remains the value of `l[x]` and `b` remains the original value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` becomes the value of `l[x+1]` and `b` becomes the value of `l[x]`. In both cases, `c` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than 0.
