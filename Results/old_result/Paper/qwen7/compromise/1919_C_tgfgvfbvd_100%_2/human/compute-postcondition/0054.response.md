Output State: **`c` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., up to the value of `n-1`, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is infinity, `b` is infinity, and the input value controlling the loop is `n-2`, `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code initializes `a` and `b` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This means that regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b`, they are now explicitly set to infinity. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
