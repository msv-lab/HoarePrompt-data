Output State: **`a` is the value of `l[x]`, `b` is the original value of `a`, `c` is increased by 1, and `n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `a` and `b` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. The condition `n > 0` is also not impacted by this line of code, so it remains true. Therefore, the updated state includes that `c` is increased by 1.
