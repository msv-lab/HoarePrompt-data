Output State: **`c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to `l[2]`, `b` is equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `a`. Given that `x` is 2, `a` is set to `l[2]`. Since the initial postcondition states that `a` is equal to `b`, and there is no change to `b` in this code snippet, `b` remains equal to `a`. The values of `c` and `x` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
