Output State: **`x` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `a` is equal to the value of the original `b`, and the value of `b` is equal to the value of the original `a`.**

Explanation: The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` using tuple unpacking. Initially, `a` is greater than `b`. After the swap, `a` takes the value of `b` and `b` takes the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
