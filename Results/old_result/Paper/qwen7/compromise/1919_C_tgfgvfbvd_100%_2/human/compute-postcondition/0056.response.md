Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in range(n)`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is controlled by the input value `n-2`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for x in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is initialized to `n-1`, it doesn't directly affect the loop condition. However, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `n` is controlled by `n-2`, so we need to ensure that `n-2` results in a value that makes `n` at least 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `x`.

State: **`x` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
