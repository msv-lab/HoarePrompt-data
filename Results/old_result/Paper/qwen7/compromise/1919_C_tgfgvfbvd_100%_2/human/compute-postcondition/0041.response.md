Output State: **`c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to `b`, `b` is equal to `l[2]`**.

The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`. Given that `x` is 2, `b` is now set to `l[2]`. The values of `c`, `x`, `a`, and the relationship between `a` and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.
