Output State: **`a` is now equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`, `n` remains greater than 0, and the current value of `l[x]` is equal to the original value of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `b`. Since `a` and `b` were swapped earlier, `b` now holds the original value of `a`, and `a` holds the original value of `b`. The assignment does not affect `n` or the condition of `l[x]` being less than or equal to `b`, so `n` remains greater than 0 and `l[x]` retains its original value relative to `b`.
