Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `x`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `c` is either 0 or 1.
   - `x` is 1 (indicating it has completed one iteration).
   - `a` is equal to `l[1]`.
   - `b` is equal to `a`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `x < n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration (`x = 1`), the next iteration will start with `x = 2`.
   - The other variables (`c`, `a`, `b`) are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the condition inside the loop.

5. **State at the Start of Next Iteration**:
   - `x` will be incremented to 2.
   - `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but based on the information provided, they do not change outside the loop.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to `l[1]`, and `b` is equal to `a`**.
