Output State: **`c` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to `b`, and `b` is equal to `a`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is equal to `l[1]` and `b` is equal to `a`. Since `a` and `b` are swapped, `a` now equals the original value of `b`, and `b` now equals the original value of `a`. Therefore, `a` is equal to `b`, and `b` is equal to `a`. The values of `c` and `x` remain unchanged.
