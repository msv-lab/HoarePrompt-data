Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = float('inf'), float('inf')
    c = 0
    for x in range(n):
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        if l[x] <= a:
            a = l[x]
        elif l[x] <= b:
            b = l[x]
        else:
            a = l[x]
            c += 1
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., up to the value of `n-1`, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, and `b` is the second smallest value in the list `l` if they are distinct, otherwise `a` equals `b` and both are the minimum value in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be `n`, `a` and `b` will be swapped compared to their initial values after the last iteration, and `c` will be incremented by `n-2` (since the loop runs `n` times and `c` is incremented each time).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `a` will be the minimum value in the list `l`, and `b` will be the second minimum value in the list `l`. The variable `c` will be equal to the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
