Output State: **`x` is `n`, `a` and `b` are swapped, `c` is `c + 1`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` were previously swapped, swapping them again brings them back to their original positions before the swap. However, the initial state already mentions that `a` and `b` were swapped, which means they are now back to their original values. The value of `c` is incremented by 1, so it remains as `c + 1`. The value of `x` remains `n` as it was not affected by the code.
