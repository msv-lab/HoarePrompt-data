Postcondition: `c` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is equal to `b`, and `b` is equal to `a`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` becomes 1, and `b` is updated to `l[x]` while `a` is also updated to `l[x]`.
