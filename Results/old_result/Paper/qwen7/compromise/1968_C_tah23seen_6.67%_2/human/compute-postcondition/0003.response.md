Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans`[1] is `arr`[0] + `ans`[0]**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` to be the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, this means `i` is incremented to 1, and `ans[1]` is set to `arr[0] + ans[0]`. Since `ans[0]` is initially undefined in the given context, it is implied to be 0 (as no other initial value is provided), so `ans[1]` becomes `arr[0]`. The condition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
