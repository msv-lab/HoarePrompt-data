Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` containing n-1 integers (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive) and an integer `n`. It calculates and returns the value of `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`, which is obtained by adding `arr[length_of_arr - 1]` to `ans[length_of_arr - 2]`.**
