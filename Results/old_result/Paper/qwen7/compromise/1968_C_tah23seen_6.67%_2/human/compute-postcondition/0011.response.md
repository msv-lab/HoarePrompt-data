Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`.
   - `ans[2]` is less than or equal to `arr[2]`.
   - `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1] + ans[0]`.

3. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - For the loop to continue, `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[2]`) must be less than or equal to `arr[2]`.
   - Given `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1] + ans[0]`, we need to ensure that `ans[2]` remains less than or equal to `arr[2]` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The loop condition depends on `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `ans[2]` remains less than or equal to `arr[2]` for the loop to continue.

Given the current state, no adjustments are needed because `ans[2]` is already less than or equal to `arr[2]` and the loop condition is satisfied. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to keep this condition true.

**State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`, `ans[2]` is less than or equal to `arr[2]`, `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1] + ans[0]`**
