Output State: `i` is the last index of `arr`; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[len(arr)]`) is equal to `ans[i]` (which is `ans[len(arr) - 1]`), and it keeps doubling until it is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i]`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the last index of the array `arr`. The value of `ans[1]` remains as the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`, which was the initial condition. For each subsequent element in `ans`, starting from `ans[2]`, the value is doubled until it exceeds the corresponding element in `arr`. Finally, `ans[i + 1]` will be the last value that satisfies the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`, and it will be equal to the previous value of `ans[i]`.
