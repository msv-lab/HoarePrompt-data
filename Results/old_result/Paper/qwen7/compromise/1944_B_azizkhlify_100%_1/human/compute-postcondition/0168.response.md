Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `2 * n`, `ul` is `ul + 4`, and the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. Since `ul` was initially `ul + 2`, after executing the code, `ul` becomes `ul + 4`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
