Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is 1.
   - The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.

5. **Final state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**.
