Output State: `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 6, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

In natural language: After all the executions of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be equal to `2 * n`, `n` must still be greater than 6, and the element in list `r` at the index `a[i] - 1` will have been incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, starting from `i = n` up to `i = 2 * n - 1`.
