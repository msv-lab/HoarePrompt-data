Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is an empty list.
- `ul` is incremented by 2, but since `ul` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value.
- `ur` is `ur + 2`, but since `ur` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value.
- `i` is 3.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its contents. The statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since we do not have the definition of `a`, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `a` and the value of `i`.

Output: **[a][3] [a][3]** (where `[a][3]` represents the value of the fourth element in the list `a`)
