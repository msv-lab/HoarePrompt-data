Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `res`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `res` contains at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `res` during the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is set to the first element of `res` during each iteration, we don't need to adjust `i` explicitly.
   - We need to ensure that `res` still contains at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`res` must contain at least one element**
