Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ul` is `ul + 4`, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `ul` was previously incremented by 2, making its new value `ul + 2`. The code then increments `ul` by 2 again, resulting in `ul` being `ul + 4`. The values of `i` and `l[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial state.
