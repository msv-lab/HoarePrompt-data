Postcondition: **`k` is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `n` remains in its initial state, `a` remains in its initial state, `r` remains in its initial state, `re` remains in its initial state, `ul` remains in its initial state, `ur` remains in its initial state, and `res` remains in its initial state. The current value of `k` is true since it is checked in the if condition.**
