Postcondition: **After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `2 * n`, `n` remains unchanged, `2 * n` remains unchanged, `ur` will be `2 * n - 2 * k`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` will be set to `0`. The loop will terminate when `ul` equals `ur`, meaning it will print each element `a[i]` twice and set `r[a[i] - 1]` to `0` until the count of printed elements matches the count of elements satisfying the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`.**
