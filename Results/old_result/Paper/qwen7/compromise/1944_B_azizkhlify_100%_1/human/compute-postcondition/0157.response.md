Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` from 2 to 0. Since `a[i] - 1` is the same as the index used before, the value at that index in list `l` is now 0. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
