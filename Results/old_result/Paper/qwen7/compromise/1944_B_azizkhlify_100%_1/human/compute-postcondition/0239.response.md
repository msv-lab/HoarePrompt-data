Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `ul` is incremented by 2.
   - `ur` is `ur + 2`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute as long as `i < 2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Final state before the next iteration**:
   - `res` remains an empty list.
   - `ul` is incremented by 2.
   - `ur` is `ur + 2`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`res` is an empty list, `ul` is incremented by 2, `ur` is `ur + 2`, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0**.
