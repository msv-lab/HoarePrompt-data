Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is a list of integers where the elements at indices `a[0] - 1`, `a[1] - 1`, ..., `a[i-1] - 1` are equal to 1.
- `res` is a list containing the elements of `a` up to index `i-1`.

The `print()` function without any arguments simply prints an empty line.

Output: **an empty line**
