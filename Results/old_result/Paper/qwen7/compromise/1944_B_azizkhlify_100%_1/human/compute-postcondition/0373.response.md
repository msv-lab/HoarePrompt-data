Output State: **`res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` to 0. Given that `i` is equal to `n + 1`, the index being modified is `a[n + 1] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
