Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `2 * n` is unchanged.
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- Therefore, `a[i]` is the same as `a[n]`.

However, the value of `a[n]` itself is not explicitly given. But since the print statement only uses `a[i]` twice and does not modify it, we can infer that the value of `a[n]` will be printed twice.

Given that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, we can deduce that `a[i] - 1` must be an index in the array `r` where the value is 2. This does not directly help us determine the value of `a[n]`, but it confirms that `a[n]` minus 1 is a valid index in `r` with a value of 2.

Since the exact value of `a[n]` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the given information.

Output: **a[n] a[n]**
