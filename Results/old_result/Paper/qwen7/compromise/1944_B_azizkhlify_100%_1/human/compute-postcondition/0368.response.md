Output State: **Postcondition: `res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the condition `if r[a[i] - 1] == 2` was being checked. The values of `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the loop or conditional block is exited.
