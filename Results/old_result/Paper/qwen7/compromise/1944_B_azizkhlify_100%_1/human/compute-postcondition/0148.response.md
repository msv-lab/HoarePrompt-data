Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the specific index being incremented is `a[n] - 1`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and that `i` is `n` remains valid after the code execution. The value of `r` at the index `a[n] - 1` is updated, but the exact value of `r` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `a` and `r` before the execution.
