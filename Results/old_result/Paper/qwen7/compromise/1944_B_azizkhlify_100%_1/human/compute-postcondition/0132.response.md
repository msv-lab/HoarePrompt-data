Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will iterate based on the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Determine the State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` will be `2 * n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `2 * n` remains unchanged.
   - `ur` will be `2 * n - 2 * k`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` will be set to `0`.

3. **Condition for Loop Termination**: The loop will terminate when `ul` equals `ur`, meaning it will print each element `a[i]` twice and set `r[a[i] - 1]` to `0` until the count of printed elements matches the count of elements satisfying the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if the user inputs an integer that hasn't been used yet.
   - Since the loop is controlled by the user input, the only variable that changes is the input itself, which is used to determine how many times the loop should run.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - The state of `i`, `n`, `2 * n`, and `ur` will be updated based on the new input.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` will be set to `0` for the new value of `i` within the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the user input for the next iteration. Let's denote the new input as `new_input`.

**State:**
- `i` will be updated to `2 * n + 1` (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `2 * n` remains unchanged.
- `ur` will be updated to `2 * (n + 1) - 2 * k` (since `n` is incremented by 1).
- `r[a[i] - 1]` for each `i` from `n` to `2 * (n + 1) - 1` will be set to `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `2 * n` remains unchanged, `ur` is `2 * (n + 1) - 2 * k`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` for each `i` from `n` to `2 * (n + 1) - 1` will be set to `0`**.
