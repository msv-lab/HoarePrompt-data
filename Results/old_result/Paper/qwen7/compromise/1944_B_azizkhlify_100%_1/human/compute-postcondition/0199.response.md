Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or has not been checked, `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 and the condition `(re == k)` is true. `re` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `re += 1` increments the value of `re` by 1. All other variables remain in their previous states.
