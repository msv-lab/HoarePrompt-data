Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `l[a[4] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (This information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop variables but might be useful for understanding the context).

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, `i` must be incremented to 5 for the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4.

Given these points, we need to update the state of `i` and ensure `n` remains greater than 4.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 5.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4**
