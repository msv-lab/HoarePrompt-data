Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts from 0).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the problem does not specify any change to `n` within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2**
