Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is unchanged
- `2 * n` is unchanged
- `ur` is `ur + 4`
- If `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

The `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, but no newline character is added due to the `end=' '` parameter.

However, the initial state does not provide the value of `a` or the specific value of `n`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1]** (where `a[n + 1]` is the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a`)
