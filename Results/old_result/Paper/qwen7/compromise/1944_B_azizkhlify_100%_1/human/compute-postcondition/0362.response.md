Output State: **`res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` updates the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` from 2 (as per the initial condition) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
