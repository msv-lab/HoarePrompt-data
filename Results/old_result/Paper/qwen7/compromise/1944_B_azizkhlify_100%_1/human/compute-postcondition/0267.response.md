Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 4; `l[a[4] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l`. Given that `i` is 4, the index used is `a[4] - 1`. However, since the actual value of `a[4]` is not provided, we can only say that the value at index `a[4] - 1` in list `l` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
