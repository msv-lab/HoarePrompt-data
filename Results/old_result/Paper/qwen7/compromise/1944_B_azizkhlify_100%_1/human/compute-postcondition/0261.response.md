Output State: **`res` list remains empty, `ul` is incremented by 6, `ur` is incremented by 6, `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `a`. The other variables (`res`, `ul`, `ur`, `i`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.
