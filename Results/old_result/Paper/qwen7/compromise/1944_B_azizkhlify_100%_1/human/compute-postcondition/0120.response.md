Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` is unchanged
- `2 * n` is unchanged
- `ur` is `ur + 4`
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0
- If `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

We need to determine the value of `a[i]` to print it twice, followed by a space. 

From the initial state:
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, which means `a[i] - 1` must be an index where `r` has a value of 0. Therefore, `a[i]` must be an index in `r` that gives `0` when accessed with `-1`.

Given this, let's assume `a[i]` is a valid index in the array `r` such that `r[a[i] - 1] = 0`. Since no specific value for `a[i]` is provided other than it being an index that satisfies `r[a[i] - 1] = 0`, we can denote `a[i]` as some index `k` where `r[k - 1] = 0`.

Therefore, the print statement will output `k` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **k k** (where `k` is an index such that `r[k - 1] = 0`)
