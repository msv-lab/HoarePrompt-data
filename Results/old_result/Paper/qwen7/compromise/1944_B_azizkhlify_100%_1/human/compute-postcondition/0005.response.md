Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes three new variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` and assigns them the value 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
