Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` contains all the elements of the list `a`.
- `ul` is equal to `ur`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is equal to `n + 1`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Given that `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be at least 2. Since `res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, we can assume `a` is a list with at least two elements.

However, the specific values of `a` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `a[i]`. But we know that `a[i]` will be the element at the index `i` in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a[i]` repeated twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]] (where [a[i]] is the element at index i in the list a, and i = n + 1)**
