Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n-1`; `l[a[n-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` must still be at least 1 (since no operations change this condition). The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Additionally, for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the value `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. This means that `l` will have been updated based on the values in the list `a`, with each element in `l` representing how many times its corresponding index appears in the first `n` elements of `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
