Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `n` to `2 * n`. The loop variable `i` starts at `2` (as given in the state at the end of the previous iteration).

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `2` and the loop increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `3`.

4. **Check the loop termination condition**: The loop will terminate if `ul` equals `ur`. However, since the loop head does not include `ul` and `ur`, these values do not affect whether the loop continues. The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `[n, 2 * n)`.

5. **Adjust the state**: Given that `i` starts at `2` and will increment to `3` in the next iteration, we need to update `i` to `3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`res` is an empty list, `ul` is incremented by 2, `ur` is `ur + 2`, `i` is 3**
