Output State: **`res` list remains empty, `ul` is incremented by 6, `ur` is incremented by 6, `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `l` is a list of n zeros, `r` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `r` with `n` zeros. The value of `n` is an input integer, so `r` will be a list containing `n` zeros. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
