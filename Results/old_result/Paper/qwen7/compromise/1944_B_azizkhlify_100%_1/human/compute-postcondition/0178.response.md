Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `2 * n`, `ul` is `ul + 6`, and the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `ul`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
