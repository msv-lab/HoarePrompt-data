Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python when the value is not needed) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - The expression `int(input())` is where the loop condition is derived. This means we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` results in a valid number of iterations.

3. **Analyze the constraints**:
   - The problem specifies that for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^4\) and \(1 \leq k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor\).
   - The variable `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This means there will be up to 5000 test cases.

4. **Formulate the required state**:
   - Since `t` is the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `t` is within the given range.
   - The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 5000.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
