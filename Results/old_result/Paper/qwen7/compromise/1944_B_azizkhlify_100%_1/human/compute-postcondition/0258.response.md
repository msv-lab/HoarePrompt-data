Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` list is empty.
- `ul` is incremented by 6, so `ul = 6`.
- `ur` is incremented by 6, so `ur = 6`.
- `i` is 3.

The loop continues to execute as long as `ul` does not equal `ur`. In this case, `ul` and `ur` both have the value 6, so the condition `ul != ur` is false, and the loop will break immediately without executing any further statements inside the loop.

Given the `print()` statement, it will simply print an empty line.

Output: **''**
