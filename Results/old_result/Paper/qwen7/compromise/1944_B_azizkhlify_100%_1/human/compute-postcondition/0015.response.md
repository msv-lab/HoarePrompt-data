Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n, 2 * n)` will start with `i` taking the value `n` and increment `i` until `i` reaches `2 * n`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least `n`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to `n` or greater.
   - The variable `n` should be kept as it is because it defines the range of the loop.

4. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be set to `n-1` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `2 * n`, but the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `2 * n`. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`, but since the loop increments just before checking the condition, `i` will be `n-1` after the last iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be set to `n` initially.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged**
