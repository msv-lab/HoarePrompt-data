Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `re` is 1; `res` contains the element `a[2]`**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 2, `res` will now contain the element `a[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `re` remain unchanged.
