Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or has not been checked, `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 and the condition `(re == k)` is true. If `(re == k)` is true, `res` contains the element `a[i]`. If `(re == k)` is false, the value of `res` remains unchanged.
