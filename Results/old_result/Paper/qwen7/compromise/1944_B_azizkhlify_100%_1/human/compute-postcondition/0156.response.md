Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is defined as `2 * n - 1`.
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Print Statement**: 
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `2 * n - 1`.
- Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be an odd number (since `2 * n - 1` results in an odd number).

However, the value of `a[i]` itself is not explicitly given. We only know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2. This means that the element in list `l` at the index `a[i] - 1` is 2. But without knowing the exact value of `a[i]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`.

Given the information, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter). Since we do not have the exact value of `a[i]`, we can only describe it in terms of its relationship with `l`.

Output: **a[i] a[i]** (where `a[i]` is the index into list `a` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2)
