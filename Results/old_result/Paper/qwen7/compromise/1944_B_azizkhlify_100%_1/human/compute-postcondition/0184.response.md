Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given information, `i` will be `2 * n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `2 * n` at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**:
   - The value of `n` is not directly provided, but it must be such that the loop can execute. Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(n)`, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

4. **Consider the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The initial value of `i` being `2 * n` ensures that the loop will start with a valid index.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to `2 * n` and `n` is greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `2 * n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
