Output State: **`res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `res` still contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is now equal to the original value of `ur` plus 2, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `i` is still equal to `n`, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 0.
