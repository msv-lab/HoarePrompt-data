Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with zeros.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are initialized to zero.
   - An empty list `res` is created to store elements that will be used to form the second part of the solution.

3. **Counting Elements in the First Half:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the array `a` and counts how many times each element appears exactly twice (`l[a[i] - 1] == 2`).
   - These elements are printed directly and removed from consideration by setting their count to zero.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - After printing elements that appear exactly twice, the program tries to fill the remaining positions in `l` using elements that appear once (`l[a[i] - 1] == 1`).
   - These elements are added to the list `res` and printed.

5. **Counting Elements in the Second Half:**
   - The program then iterates through the second half of the array `a` and counts how many times each element appears exactly twice (`r[a[i] - 1] == 2`).
   - These elements are printed directly and removed from consideration by setting their count to zero.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of `l` and `r`:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the formation of arrays `l` and `r`. It prints elements from the first half and second half without ensuring that the XOR values match.
   - The logic for forming `l` and `r` is flawed because it doesn't ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

2. **Incomplete Solution:**
   - The program does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` will equal the XOR of elements in `r`. It simply prints elements without ensuring the required condition.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
