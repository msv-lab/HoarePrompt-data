You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` strings `s`. If all characters in any string `s` are the same, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest and largest permutations of `s` based on the original string's order. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not generate a different string `r` for all cases as required. Specifically, if the input string `s` consists of all the same characters, the program will correctly output "NO". However, if the input string has more than one unique character, the program will incorrectly output a sorted version of the string instead of ensuring that the output string `r` is different from `s`.

For example, consider the input "co":
- The program should output "YES" followed by a different string like "oc".
- Instead, it outputs "YES" followed by "cc", which is not different from the input.

Similarly, for the input "mwistht":
- The program should output "YES" followed by a different string like "thtsimw".
- Instead, it outputs "YES" followed by "thtsimw", which is the same as the input when sorted.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement of generating a different string `r` for all cases.
