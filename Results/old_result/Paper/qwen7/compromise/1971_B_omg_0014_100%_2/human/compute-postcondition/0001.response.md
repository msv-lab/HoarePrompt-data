Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state, so it should be set to the starting value of the loop, which is typically 0.
   - `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is not initialized, it should be set to 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
