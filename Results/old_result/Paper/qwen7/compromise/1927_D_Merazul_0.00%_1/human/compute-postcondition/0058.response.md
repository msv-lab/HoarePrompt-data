The loop condition is `t`, which is a boolean variable. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be `True`.

Since all variables remain unchanged from their final state after 3 iterations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` must be True**
