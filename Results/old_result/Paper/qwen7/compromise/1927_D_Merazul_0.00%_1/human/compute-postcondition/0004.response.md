Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `k` is the second element of `R()`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `t` is `t - 1`. However, in the code snippet, `t` is already `t - 1` from the initial state, so when the line `*_, k = R()` is executed, `t` will be decremented by 1 again, making it `t - 2`. The variable `k` is assigned the second element returned by the function `R()`. All other variables remain unchanged.
