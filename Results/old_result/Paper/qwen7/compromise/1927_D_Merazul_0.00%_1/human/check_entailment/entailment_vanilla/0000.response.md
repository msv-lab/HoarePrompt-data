Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We have `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n).
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] ≠ a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we should output `-1 -1`.

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (*_, k) = R()
        a = {*R()}
        b = {*R()}
        f = 1
        m = n = k // 2
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Length of the array.
     - `k`: Not used in the code.
     - `a`: Set of integers from the next line.
     - `b`: Set of integers from the next line.

2. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `f`: Boolean flag initialized to `1`.
   - `m` and `n`: Both initialized to `k // 2`.

3. **Loop through `k`**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `k`:
     - `u`: Checks if `i` is in set `a`.
     - `v`: Checks if `i` is in set `b`.
     - `f &= u | v`: Ensures `f` remains `1` only if at least one of `u` or `v` is true.
     - `m -= u & ~v`: Decrements `m` if `i` is in `a` but not in `b`.
     - `n -= ~u & v`: Decrements `n` if `i` is in `b` but not in `a`.

4. **Print Output**:
   - `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`: This line is problematic. It attempts to use a ternary-like expression to decide the output string, but it does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop and the final output logic do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the sets `a` and `b` are not used correctly to find pairs of different elements within the query range.
2. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program should output pairs of indices or `-1 -1` for each query, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
