Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program expects the input to be processed in a way that doesn't match the problem statement. Specifically, it reads a value `k`, then two sets `a` and `b` from standard input, but the problem requires reading an array `a` and multiple query ranges `(l, r)`.

2. **Set Operations**: The program uses set operations (`*{R()}`) to read and process the array elements and query ranges, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to handle subarrays directly.

3. **Logic for Queries**: The logic inside the loop to check if there are two different elements within the queried range is not implemented. Instead, the program seems to be performing some bitwise operations and set membership checks that do not address the problem at hand.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints "YES" or "NO" based on some conditions involving `f`, `m`, and `n`, but it should print pairs of indices or `-1 -1` for each query as specified in the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
