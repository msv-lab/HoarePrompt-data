Output State: The output consists of 'Yes' or 'No' for each iteration based on the conditions given in the loop. Specifically, if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, and the halved value does not match the other number, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' depends on the input values for each iteration.
