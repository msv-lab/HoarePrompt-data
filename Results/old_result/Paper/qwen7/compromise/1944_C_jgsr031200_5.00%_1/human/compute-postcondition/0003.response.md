Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while nums.get(start, 0)`. The only variable involved here is `start`.

2. **Understand the condition**: The loop will continue as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set.

4. **Determine the required state for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must be truthy.
   - Since `start` is currently 0, we need to check if `nums.get(0, 0)` is truthy. If `nums.get(0, 0)` returns 0, the loop won't execute at all because 0 is falsy.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` returns a non-zero value.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` is non-zero. This means that the value at index 0 in the `nums` dictionary must be non-zero.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `nums.get(0, 0)` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is 0, `nums.get(0, 0)` must be non-zero**
