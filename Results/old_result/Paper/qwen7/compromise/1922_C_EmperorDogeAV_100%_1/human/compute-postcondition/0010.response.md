Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `back` is either -99999999999999999999 (if `i` is not greater than 0) or `cities[i - 1]` (if `i` is greater than 0), and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`, and `i` is less than `n - 1` if the condition `i < n - 1` is true. If the condition `i < n - 1` is false, `i` remains unchanged, and `back` and `forward` retain their original values as per the precondition.
