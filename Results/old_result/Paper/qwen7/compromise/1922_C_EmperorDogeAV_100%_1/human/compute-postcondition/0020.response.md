Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `i` is an integer.
- `back` is either -99999999999999999999 (if `i` is not greater than 0) or `cities[i - 1]` (if `i` is greater than 0).
- `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`.
- `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is 1.

### Loop Head Variables
The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

### Conditions for the Next Iteration
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
- For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Adjusting the States
- **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
- **`back`**: If `i` was greater than 0, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`. After incrementing `i`, `back` will now be `cities[i]` if `i` is now greater than 0. Otherwise, it remains -99999999999999999999.
- **`forward`**: `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`. After incrementing `i`, `forward` becomes `cities[i + 1]`.
- **`prog_cities[i]`**: This value is determined based on the conditions given. Since `i` is incremented, the new value of `prog_cities[i]` will depend on the new values of `back`, `forward`, and `cities[i]`.

### Final State
Given the above adjustments, the final state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `back` is updated based on the new value of `i`.
- `forward` is updated to `cities[i + 1]`.
- `prog_cities[i]` is recalculated based on the new values of `back`, `forward`, and `cities[i]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `i + 1`, `back` is `cities[i]` if `i > 0` else -99999999999999999999, `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`, and `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is 1.**
