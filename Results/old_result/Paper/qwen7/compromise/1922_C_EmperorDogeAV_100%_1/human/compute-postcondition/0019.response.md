Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `back` is either -99999999999999999999 (if `i` is not greater than 0) or `cities[i - 1]` (if `i` is greater than 0), `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`, and `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is 1.
