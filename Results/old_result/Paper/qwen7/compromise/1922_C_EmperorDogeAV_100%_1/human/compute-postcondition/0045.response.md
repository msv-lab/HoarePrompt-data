Postcondition: `i` is either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `n` remains the same, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, the values of `i`, `n`, `back`, and `forward` remain unchanged. Additionally, `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to `abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])` if `i < n - 1`, or remains unchanged if `i` is not less than `n - 1`.
