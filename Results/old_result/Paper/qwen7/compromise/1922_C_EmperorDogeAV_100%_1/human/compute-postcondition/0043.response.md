Output State: **`i` is either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `n` remains the same, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, and `prog_cities[i]` is now `1`.**

Explanation: The code `prog_cities[i] = 1` sets the value of `prog_cities[i]` to `1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `back`, and `forward` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
