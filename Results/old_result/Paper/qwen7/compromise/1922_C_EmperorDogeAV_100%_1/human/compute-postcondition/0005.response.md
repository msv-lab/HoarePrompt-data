Output State: **`i` is greater than 0; `back` is `cities[i - 1]`; `forward` is 9999999999999999999.**

Explanation: The variable `back` is assigned the value of `cities[i - 1]`. Since `i` is greater than 0, `i - 1` is a valid index for the `cities` list. The values of `i` and `forward` remain unchanged.
