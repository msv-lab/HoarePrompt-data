Functionality: **The function accepts a list `cities` of n integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and an integer `n` indicating the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is set based on specific conditions: if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, the element is set to `1`; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the distances if the index is not the last one, or `0` if it is the last index.**
