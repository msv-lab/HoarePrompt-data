Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same, `back` is `-99999999999999999999`, `forward` is `cities[k + 2]`, and `prog_cities[k + 1]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[k + 1]` if `abs(forward - cities[k + 1]) < abs(cities[k + 1] - back)`, otherwise `prog_cities[k + 1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `back` to `-99999999999999999999`. This overwrites the previous value of `back` which was either `-99999999999999999999` if `k + 1` is not greater than 0 or `cities[k]` if `k + 1` is greater than 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `forward`, and `prog_cities[k + 1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
