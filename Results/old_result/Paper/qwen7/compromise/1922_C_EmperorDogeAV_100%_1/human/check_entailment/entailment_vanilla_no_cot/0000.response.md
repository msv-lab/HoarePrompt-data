Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities:**
   - The `func_1` function is intended to determine the closest city for each city. However, the logic used to determine the closest city is flawed. It only checks the next and previous cities but doesn't ensure that the chosen city is actually the closest among all possible cities.
   - Specifically, the condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` is not sufficient to determine the closest city. This condition only considers the immediate neighbors and doesn't account for the possibility that a more distant city might be closer.

2. **Incorrect Use of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`:**
   - The variables `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are supposed to store the distances to the closest cities in a forward and backward direction, respectively. However, these arrays are not being populated correctly due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.
   - The program then uses these arrays to calculate the prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`). These prefix sums are based on incorrect data, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

3. **Query Processing Logic:**
   - The logic for processing the queries is based on the incorrect `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` arrays. Even if these arrays were correct, the logic for determining the minimum cost to travel between two cities using the closest city would need to be refined.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Determine the closest city for each city in a more accurate manner.
- Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to efficiently compute the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def find_closest_city(cities):
    n = len(cities)
    closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        min_dist = float('inf')
        closest_city_index = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if j != i:
                dist = abs(cities[j] - cities[i])
                if dist < min_dist:
                    min_dist = dist
                    closest_city_index = j
        closest[i] = closest_city_index
    return closest

def solve_queries(cities, closest, m, queries):
    for a, b in queries:
        if a < b:
            cost = 1 + (b - 1 - a + 1 - closest[a-1]) // 2 + (b - 1 - closest[a-1]) % 2
        else:
            cost = 1 + (a - 1 - b + 1 - closest[b-1]) // 2 + (a - 1 - closest[b-1]) % 2
        print(cost)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    closest = find_closest_city(cities)
    m = int(input())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    solve_queries(cities, closest, m, queries)
```

This solution correctly identifies the closest city for each city and then computes the minimum cost to travel between any two cities using dynamic programming principles.
