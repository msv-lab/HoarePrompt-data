Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Given that `t` is a positive integer, it already satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)**
