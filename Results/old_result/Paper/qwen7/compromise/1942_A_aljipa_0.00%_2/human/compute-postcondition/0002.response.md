Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each line containing either `n` occurrences of `1`, or `n` consecutive integers starting from `0`, or `-1`. Specifically, for each iteration `_` in the range of `t`:
- If `k` equals `n`, the line will contain `n` occurrences of `1`.
- If `k` equals `1`, the line will contain `n` consecutive integers starting from `0`.
- Otherwise, the line will contain `-1`.
