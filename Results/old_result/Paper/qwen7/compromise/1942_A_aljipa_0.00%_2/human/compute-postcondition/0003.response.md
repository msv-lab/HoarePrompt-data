Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing either a list of 1s of length `n`, a range from 0 to `n-1`, or `-1`, depending on the values of `n` and `k` entered for each iteration. The number of such lines will be equal to the value of `t`. Each line's content is determined by the conditions inside the loop body.
