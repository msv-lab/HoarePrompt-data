Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the sum of the first elements of lists `a` and `b` as the first element, and the sum of the second elements of lists `a` and `b` as the second element.**

This means the program returns `(x + dx, y + dy)`, where `x` is the first element of `a`, `dx` is the first element of `b`, `y` is the second element of `a`, and `dy` is the second element of `b`.
