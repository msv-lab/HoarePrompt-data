### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store player positions, goal positions, and the initial position of the Quaffle.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle movement calculations, which is used correctly later in the code.

2. **Field Description Processing**:
   - The program iterates over the field to populate the `players`, `goals`, and `quidditch` variables. This part is handled correctly.

3. **Game Steps Processing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of steps \( T \).
   - For each step, it processes the action:
     - If the action is a movement (`ULDR`), it updates the player's position using `func_1`. However, the code uses a tuple assignment directly, which is incorrect. The correct way would be to assign the result of `func_1` back to the player's position.
     - If the action is catching the ball (`C`), it updates the Quaffle holder.
     - If the action is throwing the Quaffle (`T`), it updates the Quaffle's position and checks if a goal is scored.
   - The program handles player elimination correctly when a Bludger hits a player.
   - The program prints the appropriate events (scoring, elimination) in the correct format and order.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - After processing all steps, the program correctly prints the final score.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Movement Handling**:
  - The line `players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])` is incorrect because it should be:
    ```python
    players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
    ```
  - Instead, it should be:
    ```python
    players[mo[0]] = (players[mo[0]][0] + mouvements[mo[1]][0], players[mo[0]][1] + mouvements[mo[1]][1])
    ```

- **Bludger Elimination**:
  - The logic for eliminating players due to Bludgers is correct:
    ```python
    if '.B' in players:
        for (k, v) in players.items():
            if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == k:
                    quidditch = [v, '']
                z = k
        if z != '':
            del players[z]
    ```

- **Scoring Logic**:
  - The scoring logic is correct:
    ```python
    if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
        pointsb += 1
        print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        if mo[0][0] == 'R':
            quidditch[0] = middle
        else:
            quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
    if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
        pointsr += 1
        print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        if mo[0][0] == 'B':
            quidditch[0] = middle
        else:
            quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
    ```

- **Final Score Output**:
  - The final score is correctly printed:
    ```python
    print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
    ```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct but overlooks the issue with the movement handling. The program correctly handles the majority of the requirements, including scoring, elimination, and final score calculation. However, the movement handling is incorrect, leading to potential bugs in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
