Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters describing a row of the field. The list has N rows. The field contains goals for the two teams (RG and BG), players (R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9), the Quaffle (.Q), and optionally one Bludger (.B). The number of players and goals for each team is between 1 and 5. The value of T, the number of steps in the game, is between 0 and 10000, inclusive.**
