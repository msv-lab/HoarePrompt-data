Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop control variable is `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - `n` remains the same because it is a loop control variable and does not change within the loop body unless explicitly modified.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` is still a positive integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**.
