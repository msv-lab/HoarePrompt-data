Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is `t + 1`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If neither condition is met, `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
