Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since there was no loop specified in the context, we assume it's part of a loop structure. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
