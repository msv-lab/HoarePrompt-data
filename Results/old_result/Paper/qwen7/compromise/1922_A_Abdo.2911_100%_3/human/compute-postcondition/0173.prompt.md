Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    possible = False
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if c[i] != a[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
            continue
        else:
            possible = True
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `possible` is either True or False. If `possible` is True, it means that at least once during the loop, the condition `c[i] != a[i]` was met without `c[i]` being equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `possible` is False, it means that for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is `t + 1`, and `possible` is True if any character `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` for any `i` from 0 to `n-1`; otherwise, `possible` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1 + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is either `True` or `False`. The variable `c` remains as the input string from user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
