Output State: **`possible` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `possible`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
