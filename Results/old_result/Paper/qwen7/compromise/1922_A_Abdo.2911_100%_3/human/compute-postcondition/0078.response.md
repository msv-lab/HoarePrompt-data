Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is `t + 1`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor equal to `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the value `True`, which means it is now `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
