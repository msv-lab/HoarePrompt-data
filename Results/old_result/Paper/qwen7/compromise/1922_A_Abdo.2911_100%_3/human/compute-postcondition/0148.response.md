Output State: **`i` is `n + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`**.

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being `n + t`, `n` being greater than 0, and `possible` being `True`.
