Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 because `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and `n` should be a positive integer.

4. **List the States to Be Adjusted**: Based on the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `possible` is False
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is the stripped input string
- `b` is the stripped input string
- `c` is the stripped input string

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
