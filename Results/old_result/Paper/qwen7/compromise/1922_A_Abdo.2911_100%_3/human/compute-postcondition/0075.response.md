Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `t + 1`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. The current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `i`, `n`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged.
