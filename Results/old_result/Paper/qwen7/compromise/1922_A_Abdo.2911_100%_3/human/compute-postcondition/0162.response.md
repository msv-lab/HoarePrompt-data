Postcondition: **`i` is `n + t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True` if `c[i+1]` is either equal to `a[i+1]` or `b[i+1]`. If `c[i+1]` is not equal to `a[i+1]` or `b[i+1]`, `possible` remains `False`. Additionally, if the condition `c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]` is true, `possible` remains `True`; otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
