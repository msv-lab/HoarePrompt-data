The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, which controls the number of iterations of the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `possible` is either `True` or `False`, but this does not affect the loop's continuation since the loop's condition is based solely on `t`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `t` was some positive integer `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should now be `k - 1`.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we only need to adjust the state of `t`.

State: **`possible` is either True or False, `t` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration**
