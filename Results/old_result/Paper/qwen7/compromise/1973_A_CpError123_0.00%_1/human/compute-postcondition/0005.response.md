Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. After processing all elements in `cas_de_test`, the function returns a list of integers called 'resultats', where each element is either -1 or the result of 'egalites // 2' based on certain conditions.**
