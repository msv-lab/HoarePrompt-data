### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players.
   - Each game can either be a win/loss (2 points for one, 0 for the other) or a draw (1 point for each).
   - The scores are given in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the input `t` is hardcoded to 7, and the test cases are also hardcoded in `cas_de_test`.
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of draws.

3. **Key Steps in `func_1`:**
   - Calculate the total points scored by all players combined (`total_points`).
   - Check if the total points are even; if not, it's impossible to have such scores, so append `-1`.
   - Calculate the total number of matches (`total_matchs`), which is half of the total points.
   - Ensure the total number of matches does not exceed 3 (since only 3 pairs of players exist).
   - Calculate the number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1})
     \]
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, it means the scores are inconsistent, so append `-1`.
   - Otherwise, append the number of draws divided by 2 (since each draw is counted twice).

4. **Checking the Example Cases:**
   - The provided examples match the logic in the code.
   - For instance, in the case `(0, 0, 0)`, no games were played, so no draws, resulting in `0`.
   - In the case `(0, 1, 1)`, one draw between the second and third player, resulting in `1`.
   - However, the code does not handle the case where the total number of matches exceeds 3 properly. For example, in the case `(1, 1, 2)`, the code incorrectly returns `-1` because it checks `total_matchs > 3` before calculating the number of draws, but it should check if `p3 > total_matchs` after ensuring the total points are even.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores, but it has an error in handling the condition where the total number of matches exceeds 3.
