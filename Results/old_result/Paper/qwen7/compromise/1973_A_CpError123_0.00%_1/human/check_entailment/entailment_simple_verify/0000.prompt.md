You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of multiple games between the same pair of players. Let's analyze a case where the program might fail:

Consider the input `(1, 1, 2)`:
- According to the problem description, the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.
- For the scores `(1, 1, 2)`, the program calculates the total points as `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`, which is even. So, it proceeds to calculate the number of matches.
- The total number of matches is `4 / 2 = 2`.
- The maximum number of matches between the same pair is 2 (since there are only 2 matches in total).
- The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, which gives `4 - 2 * (2 - 1) - 2 * (2 - 1) = 0`. Hence, it returns `0` as the number of draws.

However, this calculation does not account for the possibility of having multiple games between the same pair of players. For instance, the scores `(1, 1, 2)` can be achieved with the following scenario:
- Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1-1)
- Player 1 vs Player 3: Win (2-0)
- Player 2 vs Player 3: Win (2-0)

In this scenario, there is 1 draw and 2 wins, which matches the scores `(1, 1, 2)`. The program incorrectly calculates the number of draws as `0` instead of `1`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
