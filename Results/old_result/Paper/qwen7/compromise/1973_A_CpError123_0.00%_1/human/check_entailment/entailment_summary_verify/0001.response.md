### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players.
   - Each game can either be a win/loss (2 points for one, 0 for the other) or a draw (1 point for each).
   - The scores are given in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the input `t` is hardcoded to 7, and the test cases are also hardcoded in `cas_de_test`.
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of draws.

3. **Key Steps in `func_1`:**
   - Calculate the total points scored by all players combined (`total_points`).
   - Check if the total points are even; if not, it's impossible to have such scores, so append `-1`.
   - Calculate the total number of matches (`total_matchs`), which is half of the total points.
   - Ensure the total number of matches does not exceed 3 (since only 3 pairs of players exist).
   - Calculate the number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1})
     \]
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, it means the scores are inconsistent, so append `-1`.
   - Otherwise, append the number of draws divided by 2 (since each draw is counted twice).

4. **Checking the Example Cases:**
   - The provided examples match the logic in the code.
   - For instance, in the case `(0, 0, 0)`, no games were played, so no draws, resulting in `0`.
   - In the case `(0, 1, 1)`, one draw between the second and third player, resulting in `1`.
   - However, the code does not handle the general case where the number of players is not limited to 3. The hardcoded `t` and `cas_de_test` suggest that the code is only tested for these specific cases.

5. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The function should work for any number of test cases within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and for any valid scores (0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30).
   - The current implementation only handles the hardcoded cases and does not generalize to the full problem specification.

6. **Correctness of the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic for the specific test cases provided, but it does not handle the full range of inputs as specified in the problem description.
   - The hardcoded values for `t` and `cas_de_test` limit the scope of the program and do not reflect the general solution required.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct in terms of the logic implemented for the specific test cases, but it is inaccurate because the program is not generalized to handle the full range of inputs as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
