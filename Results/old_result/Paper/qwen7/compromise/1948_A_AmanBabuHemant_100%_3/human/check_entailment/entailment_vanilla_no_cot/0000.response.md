Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Odd `n`:**
   - The program correctly checks if `n` is odd and prints "NO" if so.
   - However, it does not handle even `n` correctly. For even `n`, the current implementation constructs a string with the pattern `'AAB' * (n // 2)` which will always result in a string where every character is a neighbor of another character, making it impossible to have exactly `n` special characters unless `n` is specifically constructed to allow for non-special characters between groups.

2. **Special Character Requirement:**
   - The problem requires exactly `n` special characters, but the current approach does not ensure this. The pattern `'AAB'` creates more than `n` special characters for even `n`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases like `n = 2` or `n = 4` properly. For `n = 2`, the string "MM" is a valid solution, but the current implementation would fail to generate it.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print("NO")
        elif n % 2 == 1:
            print("NO")
        else:
            # Construct a string with exactly n special characters
            s = "AAB" + "C" * (n - 2)
            if len(s) <= 200:
                print("YES")
                print(s)
            else:
                print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- It handles the case when `n` is 1 or odd, printing "NO".
- For even `n`, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by placing "AAB" followed by enough "C" characters to meet the requirement.
