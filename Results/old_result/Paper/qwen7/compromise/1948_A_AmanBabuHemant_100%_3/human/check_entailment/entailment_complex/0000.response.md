Reasoning:
- The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.
- For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd. If so, it prints 'NO' as required because an odd `n` cannot produce a string where every character has exactly one special neighbor.
- If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that every 'B' in the string will have exactly one special neighbor (the 'A' before it), and every 'A' will have exactly one special neighbor (the 'B' after it).
- It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `s`. If not, it prints 'NO'.
- The function correctly handles all constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
