Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the loop iterations. For each iteration, the loop processes two integers `l` and `r` from the input, finds a segment in the array `arr` based on these values, and prints either a segment or `-1 -1` based on certain conditions. After all iterations, the output state will consist of a series of segments printed for each valid input pair `(l, r)`, or `-1 -1` if no valid segment is found.
