Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5), a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6), and q (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5). Additionally, each query is represented by two integers l and r (where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The function processes q queries, each defined by l and r, and returns the result based on the specified conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` takes in four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q`. It also processes `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `l` and `r`. The exact nature of the processing and the return value are not specified in the given information, but the function is expected to handle these inputs according to some defined logic related to the list `a` and the range specified by `l` and `r` for each query.
