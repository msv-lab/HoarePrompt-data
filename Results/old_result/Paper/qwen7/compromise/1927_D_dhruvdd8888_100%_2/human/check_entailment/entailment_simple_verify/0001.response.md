### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads `N`, the size of the array.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and appends `-1` at the end to handle boundary conditions easily.
   - It reads the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program constructs a list `arr` to store intervals where the value of `nums` changes.
   - It iterates through the array and whenever it encounters a different value, it adds the interval to `arr`.
   - This ensures that `arr` contains intervals where the value of `nums` remains constant.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the relevant interval in `arr`.
   - It checks if the start of the interval is within the query bounds. If so, it prints the indices of the start and one position after the start.
   - If the end of the interval is within the query bounds, it prints the indices of the start and end of the interval.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Interval Construction:**
   - The interval construction logic is correct. It correctly identifies segments where the array values are the same.
   - The logic ensures that `arr` contains intervals where the value of `nums` remains constant, which is crucial for finding different elements within a query range.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The query handling logic is correct. It uses binary search to efficiently find the relevant segment in `arr`.
   - The logic for printing the result based on the segment boundaries is correct. It ensures that the printed indices are within the query range and represent different elements.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly:
     - When the start of the interval is greater than `l`, it prints `-1 -1` if the interval does not overlap with the query range.
     - When the end of the interval is less than `r`, it prints `-1 -1` if the interval does not overlap with the query range.
     - When the interval boundaries fall within the query range, it prints the correct indices.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement. There are no logical errors or missing parts that would cause the program to fail.
