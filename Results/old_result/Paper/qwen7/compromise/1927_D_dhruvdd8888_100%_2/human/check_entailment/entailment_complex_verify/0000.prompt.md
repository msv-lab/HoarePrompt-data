You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the loop iterations. For each iteration, the loop processes two integers `l` and `r` from the input, finds a segment in the array `arr` based on these values, and prints either a segment or `-1 -1` based on certain conditions. After all iterations, the output state will consist of a series of segments printed for each valid input pair `(l, r)`, or `-1 -1` if no valid segment is found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries. It first identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in `nums` and stores their start and end indices along with the value of the elements. Then, for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it determines whether a valid segment exists within the specified range and prints the start and end indices of that segment, or `-1 -1` if no valid segment is found.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same. Specifically, in the `func_1` function, the program checks if `s > l` and `e >= r` to determine if there are different elements within the queried range. However, if all elements in the queried subarray are the same, both `s` and `e` will point to the same index, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The program will output:

```
-1 -1
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

However, for the query `1 2`, there should be a valid pair of indices since the subarray `[1, 1]` has the same element. The correct output should be `1 2`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it finds a different element within the queried subarray. One way to do this is to check if `s` and `e` are within the queried range and if they point to different elements. Here's a modified version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        num = nums[i]
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        (s, e, _) = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            if s < l or s > r or e < l or e > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly handles cases where all elements in the queried subarray are the same.
