Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the queries. It only processes one query at a time, but the problem requires processing multiple queries for each test case.
   - The logic for finding pairs `(i, j)` within the query range `[l, r]` is flawed. Specifically, the logic for determining `s` and `e` indices is not correctly implemented to ensure that `a_i â‰  a_j`.

2. **Array Construction:**
   - The array `arr` is constructed to store the start and end positions of segments where the value of `num` changes. However, this approach does not directly help in finding distinct elements within a query range `[l, r]`.

3. **Query Processing Logic:**
   - The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find the segment that starts before or at `l`, but the logic to determine `s` and `e` is incorrect. It should check if there are distinct elements within the query range `[l, r]`.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

tc = int(input())

for ppp in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    Q = int(input())
    
    # Find distinct elements in the range [l, r]
    def find_distinct_elements(l, r):
        distinct_elements = set()
        for i in range(l-1, r):
            distinct_elements.add(nums[i])
            if len(distinct_elements) > 1:
                return (i, i+1)
        return (-1, -1)
    
    for _ in range(Q):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        (i, j) = find_distinct_elements(l, r)
        print(i, j)
    print()  # Print an empty line between test cases
```

This corrected version:
1. Defines a helper function `find_distinct_elements` to find the first two distinct elements within the query range `[l, r]`.
2. Uses a simple loop to iterate through the range `[l-1, r-1]` and collects distinct elements.
3. Prints the indices of the first two distinct elements found within the query range. If no distinct elements are found, it prints `-1 -1`.
