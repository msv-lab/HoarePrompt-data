Reasoning:
1. **Segment Identification**: The function correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array `nums`. This is done by iterating through the array and appending segments to the list `arr` whenever it encounters a different element.
2. **Query Processing**: For each query, the function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that lies within the range `[l, r]`. It then checks the boundaries of this segment to determine if there is a valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i â‰  a_j` within the query range.
3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the segment starts before `l` or ends after `r`, or when no valid segment is found within the range.
4. **Output Format**: The function outputs the correct format as specified in the problem statement, printing either the indices of the valid segment or `-1 -1` if no such segment exists.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
