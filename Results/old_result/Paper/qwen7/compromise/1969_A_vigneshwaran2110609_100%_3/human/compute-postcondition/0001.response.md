Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and will start from 0 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to n-1).
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Check the given state**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This value is not relevant to the loop execution.
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\). This value will determine the number of iterations.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and \(p_i \neq i\), and all `p_i` are distinct. This list is not directly involved in the loop execution.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be 0.
   - The value of `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\) for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive**
