Output State: **`i` is 100, `x` is an input integer, `n` must be within the range [2, 50], `flag` remains False, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `l` by mapping each element from the input (which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers) to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `i`, `x`, `n`, `flag`, and the list `l` remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains integers that were input by the user.
