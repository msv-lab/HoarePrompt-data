Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50; `flag` is True**

Explanation: The variable `flag` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 1, and `x` still must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
