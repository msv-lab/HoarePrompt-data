Output State: **`i` is 101, `x` is greater than 100, `n` is within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user**

The code simply reassigns the variable `flag` to `True`, which does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
