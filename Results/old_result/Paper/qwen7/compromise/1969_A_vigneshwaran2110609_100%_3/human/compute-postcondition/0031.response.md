Output State: **`i` is 50, `x` must be greater than 50, `n` must be within the range [2, 50], and the element at index `l[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to `i + 1`, `flag` is True.**

Explanation: The line `flag = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `flag`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `flag` and retains the preconditions for the other variables.
