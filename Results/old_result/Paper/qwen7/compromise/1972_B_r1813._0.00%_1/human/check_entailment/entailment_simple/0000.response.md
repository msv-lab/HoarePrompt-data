### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function starts by reading all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splitting it into a list of strings. This is done correctly.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The function then iterates through each test case, extracting `n` and `s` for each case. This is also done correctly.

3. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**: The number of coins facing up (`num_up_coins`) is calculated correctly by counting the occurrences of 'U' in the string `s`.

4. **Determining the Winner**: The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This logic is correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Output**: The function prints the result ('YES' or 'NO') for each test case, which is done correctly.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the number of coins is 1 or 2 appropriately, as per the problem description.

Given that the program correctly parses the input, counts the number of facing-up coins, determines the winner based on the parity of the count, and outputs the results, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
