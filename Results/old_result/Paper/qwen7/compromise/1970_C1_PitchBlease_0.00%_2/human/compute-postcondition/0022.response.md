Output State: **`queue` is now a deque containing the tuples (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), `current` is the next unvisited neighbor of the original current node, `dist` is 1, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, `neighbor`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. Given that `dist` was initially 0, `dist + 1` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
