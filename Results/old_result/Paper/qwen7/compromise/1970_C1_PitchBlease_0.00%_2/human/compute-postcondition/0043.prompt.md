Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `queue` is a deque without the first element (which was dequeued), `current` is the neighbor that was dequeued from the `queue`, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node. If `current` is the `target` node, the function returns `dist`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` is the neighbor that was dequeued from the `queue`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, and the `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` is the new neighbor from `tree[current]` that is not in the `visited` set, and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` is the next neighbor from `tree[current]` that is not in the `visited` set, and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
