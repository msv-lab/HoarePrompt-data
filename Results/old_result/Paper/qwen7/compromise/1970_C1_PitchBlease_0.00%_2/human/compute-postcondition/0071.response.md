Functionality: **The function `bfs` takes two parameters, `start` and `target`, representing the starting and target nodes in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, it returns the distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not found, it returns the distance to the farthest node reachable from the `start` node. If no path exists, it returns -1.**
