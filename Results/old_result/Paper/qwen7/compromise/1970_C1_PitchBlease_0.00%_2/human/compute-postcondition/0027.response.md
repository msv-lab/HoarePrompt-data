Output State: **The `queue` is now a deque without the first element (which was dequeued), `current` is the neighbor that was dequeued from the `queue`, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, `start` is the integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` node and all unvisited neighbors of `current`, and the `queue` is updated.**

This means the first element `(neighbor, dist + 1)` from the `queue` has been removed, and the `current` and `dist` variables have been updated to the values of the dequeued tuple. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their previous values.
