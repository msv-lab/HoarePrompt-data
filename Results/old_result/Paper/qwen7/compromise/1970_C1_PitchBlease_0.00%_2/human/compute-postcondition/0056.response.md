Output State: **`visited` now contains `neighbor`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, and `current` will be the next `neighbor` from the previous iteration's `tree[current]`**.

In this output state, the `visited` set has been updated to include the `neighbor`. The conditions for `tree[current]` and `current` remain the same as the initial state, meaning `tree[current]` still must contain at least one element, and `current` will be the next `neighbor` from the previous iteration's `tree[current]`.
