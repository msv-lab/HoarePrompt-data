Output State: **`visited` now contains `neighbor`; `queue` contains a tuple of `(neighbor, dist + 1)`; `tree[current]` must contain at least one element; and `current` will be the next `neighbor` from the previous iteration's `tree[current]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now includes this new tuple. The `visited` list still contains the `neighbor` from the previous state. The `tree[current]` condition remains unchanged, meaning it still contains at least one element. Lastly, `current` is set to be the next `neighbor` from the previous iteration's `tree[current]`.
