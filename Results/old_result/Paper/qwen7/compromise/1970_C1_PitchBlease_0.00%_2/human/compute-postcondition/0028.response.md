Output State: **The program returns the distance `dist` from the `start` node to the `current` node that was dequeued from the `queue`.**

This means the program returns the distance calculated up to the point where the `current` node was dequeued from the `queue`. The `dist` variable holds this distance value, which is the shortest path length from the `start` node to the `current` node in the tree structure being traversed.
