Output State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the first element of `tree[current]`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`.**

In this output state, the `neighbor` variable, which was the first element of `tree[current]`, is added to the `visited` set. The conditions that `tree[current]` must contain at least one element and that `neighbor` is the first element of `tree[current]` remain unchanged.
