The loop condition is `while queue:`. This means the loop continues as long as the `queue` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the `queue` contains tuples of all neighbors of the nodes that are at a distance of `dist + 1` from the `start` node, `current` is the last neighbor dequeued from the `queue`, and `visited` contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `queue` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that the `queue` is not empty.

State: **The `queue` must contain at least one tuple of neighbors, `current` is the last neighbor dequeued from the `queue`, and `visited` contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal.**
