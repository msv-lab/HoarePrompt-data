Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a set called `visited` and adds the starting node (`start`) to it. The other variables (`queue` and `target`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
