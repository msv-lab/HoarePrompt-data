Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of the game based on the optimal moves between Ron and Hermione. The game is played on a tree structure with exactly two leaves, and the winner is determined by the parity of the shortest distances from the starting node to the two leaves.
2. Function `func_1` constructs the tree and identifies the two leaves. It then uses the `bfs` function to calculate the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf.
3. The logic in `func_1` checks if either of these distances is even. If at least one distance is even, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.
4. The `bfs` function correctly implements a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node. Since the tree has exactly two leaves, the function will always find the target node and return the correct distance.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided implementation should correctly determine the winner for each round based on the input provided.

Correctness: **True**
