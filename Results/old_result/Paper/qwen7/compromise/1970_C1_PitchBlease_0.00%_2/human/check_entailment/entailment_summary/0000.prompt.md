Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Functions with Execution Summary:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
start = starts[0]
print(func_1(n, edges, start))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]

    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0:
        return 'Ron'
    else:
        return 'Hermione'
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts three parameters: `n`, representing the number of nodes in the tree; `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree; and `start`, representing the starting node for the game. It constructs the tree structure, identifies the two leaves, calculates the shortest distances from the start node to each leaf using BFS, and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on whether these distances are even or odd.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        (current, dist) = queue.popleft()
        if current == target:
            return dist
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `bfs` takes two parameters, `start` and `target`, representing the starting and target nodes in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, it returns the distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not found, it returns the distance to the farthest node reachable from the `start` node. If no path exists, it returns -1.
