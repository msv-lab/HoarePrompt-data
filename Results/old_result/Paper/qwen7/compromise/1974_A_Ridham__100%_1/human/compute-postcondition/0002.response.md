State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `n` which is used as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0. The initial value of `n` being an input integer does not guarantee that it is greater than 0, so it needs to be adjusted.
3. The other variables (`t` and `result`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
