Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons must be filled with 1x1 icons in a way that minimizes the total number of screens.

For example, consider the input `(x, y) = (12, 4)`. According to the problem description, we need to fit 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2 on the minimum number of screens. Each screen has 15 cells (5x3 grid).

The program calculates the space required for 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons but does not correctly distribute the 1x1 icons among the screens. Here's a corrected approach:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
3. Distribute the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells across the screens to minimize the total number of screens.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screen_require_for_y = (y + 3) // 4
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4
        # Distribute the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
        extra_screens_for_x = (x + remaining_cells - 1) // 15
        total_screens = screen_require_for_y + extra_screens_for_x
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the 1x1 icons are distributed optimally across the screens to minimize the total number of screens needed.
