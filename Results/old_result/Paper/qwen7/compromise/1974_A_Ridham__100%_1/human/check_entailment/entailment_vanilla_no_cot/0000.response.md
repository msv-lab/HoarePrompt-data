Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Space Occupied:**
   - The variable `space_x` should be `x * 1` but it's actually being set to `x * 1`, which is redundant.
   - The variable `space_y` should be `y * 4` but it's not accounting for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells per screen.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells:**
   - The calculation of `remaining_cells` is incorrect. It should be based on the total number of cells available in the screens minus the cells already occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - The formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` does not correctly account for the total number of cells used by both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

3. **Handling of Extra Space:**
   - The logic for calculating the extra space and additional screens is flawed. It does not correctly handle the distribution of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

4. **Logic for Placing Icons:**
   - The program does not correctly place the icons to minimize the number of screens. It assumes that all 2x2 icons can be placed first and then fills the remaining space with 1x1 icons, which may not always yield the minimum number of screens.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_icons = x + y
        total_cells = 15 * (total_icons // 5 + (1 if total_icons % 5 != 0 else 0))
        if y > 0:
            total_cells -= y * 4
        result.append(total_icons // 5 + (1 if total_icons % 5 != 0 else 0))
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the minimum number of screens required by considering the total number of icons and the capacity of each screen, ensuring that the placement of icons is done optimally to minimize the number of screens.
