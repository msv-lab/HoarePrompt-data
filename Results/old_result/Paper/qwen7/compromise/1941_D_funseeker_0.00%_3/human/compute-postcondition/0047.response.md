Postcondition: `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `temp` is a set that now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `q` is `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'.
