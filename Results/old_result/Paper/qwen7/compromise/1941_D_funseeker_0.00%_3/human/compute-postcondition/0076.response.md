Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, and the last element in the set `ans` is `(q + r) % n`; `temp` contains the element `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The last element in the set `ans` remains unchanged because the condition specified that if the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?', the last element in `ans` remains the same. Since the current value of `c` is '1' or '?', the last element in `ans` stays as `(q + r) % n`. The set `temp` now includes the new element `(q - r) % n`.
