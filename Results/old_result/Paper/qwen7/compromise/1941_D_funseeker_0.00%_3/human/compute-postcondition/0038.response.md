Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for q in ans:`. The variables involved here are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `ans` contains the elements of the set `temp`.
   - `q` is `x`.
   - `temp` is an empty set.
   - `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. Since `ans` contains the elements of the set `temp`, and `temp` is initially an empty set, `ans` will also be an empty set until elements are added to `temp`.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: To ensure that the loop can execute, `temp` must contain at least one element. This means that after adding an element to `temp`, `ans` will have at least one element, and the loop can proceed.

5. **Final state adjustment**: We need to ensure that `temp` has at least one element before the loop starts. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `temp` has at least one element.

Given this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (which comes from `temp`), `q` is `x`, `temp` is a set that must have at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**.
