Based on the initial state provided, the set `ans` contains \(2^m - 1\) elements after the loop completes. Additionally, if `0` is present in `ans`, then `n` must also be present in `ans`. If `0` is not present in `ans`, then `n` is not present either.

Given this information, the `print(*ans)` statement will print all the elements in the set `ans`. Since the exact elements are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of the conditions given.

Output: **the elements of the set ans, which contains \(2^m - 1\) elements, and if 0 is in ans, then n is also in ans**
