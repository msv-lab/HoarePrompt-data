Postcondition: `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `q` is `x`, `temp` is a set that must have at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. If the current value of `c` is either '0' or '?', the value of `c` remains unchanged.
