Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1()` and `func_3()`. It processes the distance and direction of each throw to update the player who has the ball and returns a string detailing the sequence of players who received the ball.**

This means the function `func_4` does not take any direct parameters but uses the results from `func_1()` and `func_3()`. It then updates the player holding the ball based on the distance and direction of each throw and returns a string that shows the sequence of players receiving the ball.
