Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, and the last element in the set `ans` is (q + r) % n, `temp` contains (q + r) % n.**

Explanation: The code adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `ans` initially contains at least one element, and the last element in `ans` is either `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or `(q - r) % n` if `c` is neither '1' nor '?', the last element in `ans` remains unchanged. However, `temp` now includes the new value `(q + r) % n`.
