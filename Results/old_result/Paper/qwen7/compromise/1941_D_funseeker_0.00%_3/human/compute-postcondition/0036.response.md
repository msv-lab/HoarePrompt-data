Output State: **`ans` contains the elements of the set `temp`, `q` is `x`, `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, `(x + r) % n`, `((x + r) % n + r) % n`, and `(((x + r) % n + r) % n - r) % n`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**.

Explanation: The line `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` into an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `r` is now an integer, but the exact value depends on the first value returned by `func_1().split()`. The other variables (`ans`, `q`, `temp`, and `c`) retain their initial conditions.
