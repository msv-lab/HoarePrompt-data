Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the set `temp`. The element added is the result of `(q + r) % n`. Since `q` is equal to `x`, the element added is `(x + r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
