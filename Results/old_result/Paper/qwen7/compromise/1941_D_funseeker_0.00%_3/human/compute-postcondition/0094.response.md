Output State: The set `ans` will contain a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements, with the last element being either \((q + r) \% n\) or \((q - r) \% n\) depending on the value of `c`.

- If `c` is '1' or '?', the last element in `ans` will be \((q + r) \% n\).
- If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', the last element in `ans` will be \((q - r) \% n\).

The set `temp` will contain all unique elements generated during the loop's execution. Specifically, `temp` will include:
- \((q + r) \% n\) for each iteration where `c` is '1' or '?'.
- \((q - r) \% n\) for each iteration where `c` is '1' or '?'.

If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` will contain exactly two elements: \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\). If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` will not contain any additional elements beyond those already present in `ans`.

In summary, the final state of `ans` and `temp` will reflect the outcomes of all iterations based on the conditions specified within the loop.
