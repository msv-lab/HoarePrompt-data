You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the initial player x. The function func_1() returns a string containing the distance r and direction c of each throw, and func_3() returns a tuple (n, m, x).
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: Output State: The set `ans` will contain a total of \(2^m - 1\) elements after the loop executes all its iterations. These elements will be a combination of all unique results generated from the operations \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) for each iteration, starting with the initial set containing `x`. Each element in `ans` will be derived from the initial `x` through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n`, based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1().split()` in each iteration. The final state of `ans` will include all possible combinations of these operations, reflecting the complete execution of the loop for `m` iterations.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: The set `ans` will contain a total of \(2^m - 1\) elements after the loop executes all its iterations. If `0` is present in `ans`, then `ans` will also contain the element `n`. Otherwise, `0` is not in `ans`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: 2^m - 1
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: the elements of the set ans, which contains \(2^m - 1\) elements, and if 0 is in ans, then n is also in ans
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1()` and `func_3()`. It processes the distance and direction of each throw to update the player who has the ball and returns a string detailing the sequence of players who received the ball.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
