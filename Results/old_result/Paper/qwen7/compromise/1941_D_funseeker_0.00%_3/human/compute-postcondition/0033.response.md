Output State: **The set `ans` contains the elements of the set `temp`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, `(x + r) % n`, `((x + r) % n + r) % n`, and `(((x + r) % n + r) % n - r) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The line `ans = temp` replaces the contents of the set `ans` with the contents of the set `temp`.
- Since `temp` contains the specified elements, `ans` now also contains these elements.
- The variable `q` remains unchanged and is still equal to `x`.
- The set `temp` retains its original elements as no changes are made to it after the assignment.
