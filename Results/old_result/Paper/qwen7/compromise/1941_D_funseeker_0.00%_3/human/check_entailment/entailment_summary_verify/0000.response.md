### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a circular game where a ball is thrown between players based on specified distances and directions.
   - The goal is to determine the possible players who could have the ball after a series of throws.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads a single line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - **func_2()**: Converts the output of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - **func_3()**: Converts the output of `func_1()` to a list of integers.
   - **func_4()**: This is the main function that processes the game logic.

3. **Main Function (func_4())**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - Reads the number of players (`n`), number of throws (`m`), and the starting player (`x`).
     - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - **Processing Throws**:
     - Iterates through each throw.
     - Reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` (either '0', '1', or '?').
     - Updates the set `ans` to include the possible new positions of the ball.
       - If `c` is '0' or '?', the ball can move clockwise.
       - If `c` is '1' or '?', the ball can move counterclockwise.
     - Ensures that the set `ans` does not contain player 0 and replaces it with player `n` if necessary.
   - **Output**:
     - Prints the size of the set `ans` and its elements in sorted order.

4. **Function Summary Verification**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_4()`. It correctly mentions that the function processes throws, updates the set of possible players, and handles the special case of player 0 being replaced by player `n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the special case of player 0 being replaced by player `n` correctly.
   - The use of sets ensures efficient management of the possible positions of the ball.
   - The program correctly processes both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, including the '?' case.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It handles all edge cases and special conditions as required.
   - The use of sets ensures that the output is unique and in the correct order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all necessary cases.
