Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution contains a logical error in the `func_1` function, which is not actually used in the `func_2` function. The `func_1` function is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct implementation of the balanced shuffle operation. Moreover, the `BalanceInfo` class is not defined in the provided code snippet, which would be required to properly implement the logic.

To correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation, you should directly use the `func_2` approach but ensure that the `BalanceInfo` class is defined and used appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character

def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = "(()(()))"
    func_2(s)
```

This corrected version defines the `BalanceInfo` class and uses it to store the necessary information for sorting and generating the balanced shuffle. The `func_2` function then sorts the list of `BalanceInfo` objects and constructs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.
