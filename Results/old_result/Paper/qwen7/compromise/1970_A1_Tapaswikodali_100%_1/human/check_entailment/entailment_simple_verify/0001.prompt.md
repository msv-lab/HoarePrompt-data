You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to perform a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle operation involves computing the balance of each prefix and sorting the characters based on these balances.

2. **Key Components:**
   - **Balance Calculation:** For each position in the string, calculate the balance of the prefix up to that position.
   - **Sorting:** Sort the characters based on their prefix balance and position in descending order if there is a tie.
   - **Result Construction:** Construct the resulting string from the sorted characters.

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     ```python
     def func_1(infoA, infoB):
         if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
             return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
         return infoB.position - infoA.position
     ```
     - This function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
     - It sorts characters primarily by balance and secondarily by position in descending order.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     ```python
     def func_2(s):
         n = len(s)
         balance_info = []
         balance = 0
         for i in range(n):
             balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
             if s[i] == '(':
                 balance += 1
             else:
                 balance -= 1
         balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
         result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
         print(result)
     ```
     - **Initialization:**
       - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
       - `balance_info` is a list to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
       - `balance` is initialized to 0.
     - **Balance Calculation:**
       - For each character in the string, update the balance and append a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info`.
     - **Sorting:**
       - The `balance_info` list is sorted using a lambda function that sorts by balance and position in descending order.
     - **Result Construction:**
       - The result string is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.
     - **Output:**
       - The result string is printed.

4. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly computes the balance for each prefix.
   - The `BalanceInfo` objects are sorted according to the specified criteria.
   - The resulting string is constructed and printed.

The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
