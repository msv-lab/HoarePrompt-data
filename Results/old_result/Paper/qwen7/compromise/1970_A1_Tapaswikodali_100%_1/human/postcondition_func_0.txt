The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects with attributes `balance` (an integer) and `position` (an integer). Depending on the values of these attributes, the function returns either the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and `infoB` or the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and `infoA`. Specifically, if the `balance` of `infoA` is not equal to the `balance` of `infoB`, it returns the difference in their balances; otherwise, it returns the difference in their positions.
