Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance` is the final balance calculated after processing all characters in `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance, index, and character from `s` at that index, sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order within groups of same balance; `result` is a string consisting of characters from `s` ordered by their balance and position.**

Explanation: The code `result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)` joins the characters from `s` based on the `balance_info` list, which is already sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order within groups of the same balance. This means that the resulting string `result` will contain the characters from `s` in the specified order. All other variables (`s`, `n`, `balance`, and `balance_info`) remain unchanged.
