Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `times` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds the integer value entered by the user. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` still holds the value specified in the initial state, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
