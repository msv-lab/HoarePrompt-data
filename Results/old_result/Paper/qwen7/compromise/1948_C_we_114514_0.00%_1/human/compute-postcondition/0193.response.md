Output State: **`reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n + 1`; `reachable_second_row` is True.**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `n`, `j`, and `row1`, `row2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
