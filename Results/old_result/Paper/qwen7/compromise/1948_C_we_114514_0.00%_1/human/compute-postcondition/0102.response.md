Output State: **reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is True**

The code simply reassigns the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The value of `reachable_first_row` remains `False`, and the other variables (`n` and `j`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state retains the unchanged values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
