Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, n is equal to n, (row1, row2) from test_case, j is equal to n - 1, and results contains either 'YES' or ['NO'] depending on the conditions met within the loop, and test_case is the next test case in test_cases
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are both True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n - 1`. If the condition `reachable_second_row` is met, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values. If `row2[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_first_row` becomes False and `reachable_second_row` becomes True. If `row2[j] != '>'`, then `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged (either True or False), `reachable_second_row` becomes True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n + 1`. If `j == n - 1` and `row1[j] == '>', then `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged. If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>', then `reachable_first_row` is False. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
