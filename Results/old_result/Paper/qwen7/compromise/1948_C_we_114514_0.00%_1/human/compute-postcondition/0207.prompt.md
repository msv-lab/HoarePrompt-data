Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings of length n, where each string consists only of '<' and '>' characters.
Code of the loop:
for test_case in test_cases:
    n, (row1, row2) = test_case
    reachable_first_row = True
    reachable_second_row = False
    for j in range(n):
        if reachable_first_row:
            if row1[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
            else:
                reachable_first_row = False
                if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            if row2[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `reachable_first_row` is True if every character in `row1` from index 0 to `n-2` is not '>', and the last character (`row1[n-1]`) is '>', otherwise it is False; `reachable_second_row` remains True; the value of `j` is `n - 1`; `results` list contains 'YES' if `reachable_first_row` is True, otherwise it contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: reachable_first_row is True or False, reachable_second_row is True or False, n is greater than 0, j is equal to n - 1, and results contains either 'YES' or ['NO'] depending on the conditions met within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: reachable_second_row is True, reachable_first_row remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, j remains unchanged, and results contains 'YES'. If reachable_second_row is False, reachable_first_row remains unchanged, results is ['NO'], and n remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
