Postcondition: **`reachable_first_row` is True if every character in `row1` from index 0 to `n-2` is not '>', and the last character (`row1[n-1]`) is '>', otherwise it is False; `reachable_second_row` remains True; the value of `j` is `n - 1`; `results` list contains 'YES' if `reachable_first_row` is True, otherwise it contains 'NO'.**
