Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n + 1`. If `j` equals `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is not `'>',` then `reachable_first_row` is `False`. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `reachable_second_row` is `True`.
