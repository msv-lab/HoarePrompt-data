Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `n - 1`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, the condition remains as is if `row2[j] == '>'`. Otherwise, the condition also holds true if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`.
