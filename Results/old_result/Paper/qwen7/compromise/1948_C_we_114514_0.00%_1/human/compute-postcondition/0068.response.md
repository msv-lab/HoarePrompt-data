Output State: **reachable_first_row is True, n is test_case[0], row1 is test_case[1][0], and row2 is test_case[1][1]**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `reachable_first_row`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `row1`, or `row2`, which remain as they were in the initial state.
