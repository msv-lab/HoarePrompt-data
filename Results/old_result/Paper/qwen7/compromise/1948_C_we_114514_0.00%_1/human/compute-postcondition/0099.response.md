Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `reachable_second_row` to `True`, which does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row`, `n`, or `j`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
