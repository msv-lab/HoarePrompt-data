Output State: **reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is True, n must be greater than 0, j is 1, the current value of row1[j] is '>', and j is equal to n - 1.**

The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`, which changes its value from `False` to `True`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
