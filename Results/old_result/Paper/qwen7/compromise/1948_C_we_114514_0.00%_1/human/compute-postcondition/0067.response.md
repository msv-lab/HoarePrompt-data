Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `test_case[0]`, `row1` is assigned the value of `test_case[1][0]`, and `row2` is assigned the value of `test_case[1][1]`.**

This means that the tuple `test_case` is unpacked into three variables: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`. `n` gets the first element of `test_case`, `row1` gets the first element of the second element of `test_case`, and `row2` gets the second element of the second element of `test_case`.
