Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, reachable_first_row is unchanged, n is unchanged, j is unchanged, results contains 'YES'**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `reachable_second_row` is a boolean value and its state is True, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, and `n` and `j` remain unchanged as well. The list `results` now contains the string 'YES'.
