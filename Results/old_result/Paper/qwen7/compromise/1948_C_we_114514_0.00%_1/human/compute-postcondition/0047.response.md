Postcondition: **reachable_second_row remains True, reachable_first_row remains False, and j is j + 1. If `j < n - 1` and the element at index `j` in `row2` is '>', then `j` is incremented by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes that the state of `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged from the precondition, and `j` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if the condition `j < n - 1` and the element at index `j` in `row2` is '>', then `j` is further incremented by 1.
