Postcondition: **reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row are boolean values. If row1[j] is '>', then reachable_first_row is true, reachable_second_row is true, and j equals n - 1. If row1[j] is not '>', then reachable_first_row is false, reachable_second_row is true, and j is less than n - 1. Additionally, since the if condition is true, row2[j] equals '>' and reachable_second_row remains true.**
