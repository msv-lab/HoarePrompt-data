Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings of length n, where each string consists only of '<' and '>' characters.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True

                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:

    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether `reachable_second_row` becomes True for any test case. If `reachable_second_row` becomes True for any test case, the corresponding entry in `results` will be 'YES'; otherwise, it will be 'NO'. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `n`, and `j` will reflect the final state of the last executed test case, but since the loop processes each test case independently, these values may vary between different entries in the `results` list. The `results` list will have a length equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will be set based on the conditions met during the last iteration of the loop for the last test case.
    #- `n` will be the `n` value of the last test case processed.
    #- `j` will be `n - 1`, as the inner loop always checks up to `n - 1`.
    #- `results` will contain one 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether `reachable_second_row` was made True for that specific test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list called `results` that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. Each entry in the list indicates whether `reachable_second_row` became True for that specific test case. The length of the list is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`. For the last test case, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` reflect the final state, `n` is the `n` value of the last test case, and `j` is `n - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings of length `n`, consisting only of '<' and '>' characters. It returns a list called `results` that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether `reachable_second_row` became True for that specific test case. The length of the list matches the number of test cases in `test_cases`. For each test case, the function checks if it's possible to reach the second row from the first row following the directions given by the strings `row1` and `row2`.
