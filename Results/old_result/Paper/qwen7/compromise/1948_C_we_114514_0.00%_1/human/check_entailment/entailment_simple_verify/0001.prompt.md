You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether `reachable_second_row` becomes True for any test case. If `reachable_second_row` becomes True for any test case, the corresponding entry in `results` will be 'YES'; otherwise, it will be 'NO'. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `n`, and `j` will reflect the final state of the last executed test case, but since the loop processes each test case independently, these values may vary between different entries in the `results` list. The `results` list will have a length equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will be set based on the conditions met during the last iteration of the loop for the last test case.
    #- `n` will be the `n` value of the last test case processed.
    #- `j` will be `n - 1`, as the inner loop always checks up to `n - 1`.
    #- `results` will contain one 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether `reachable_second_row` was made True for that specific test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list called `results` that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. Each entry in the list indicates whether `reachable_second_row` became True for that specific test case. The length of the list is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`. For the last test case, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` reflect the final state, `n` is the `n` value of the last test case, and `j` is `n - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n`, the first row of the grid (`row1`), and the second row of the grid (`row2`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes two flags: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
     - `reachable_first_row` indicates if the robot can stay in the first row.
     - `reachable_second_row` indicates if the robot can reach the last column in the second row.
   - It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it checks if it can move to the next column. If it reaches the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the left (`<`), it cannot stay in the first row anymore, so it switches to the second row and checks if the arrow points to the right. If it does, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it checks if it can move to the next column. If it reaches the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Determining the Result:**
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it means the robot can reach the last column in the second row, and it appends `'YES'` to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends `'NO'` to the results list.

### Verification Against Example Cases

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Grid: 
     ```
     >><<
     >>><
     ```
   - The robot starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves to (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).
   - The program correctly identifies this path and outputs `YES`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     ><
     ><
     ```
   - The robot starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves to (2, 1) -> (2, 2).
   - The program correctly identifies this path and outputs `YES`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     >>><
     >><<
     ```
   - The robot starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves to (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).
   - The program correctly identifies this path and outputs `NO`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     >><<><
     ><>>><
     ```
   - The robot starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves to (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).
   - The program correctly identifies this path and outputs `YES`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid configuration. Therefore, the program is correct.
