Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split(), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `ans` or any other variables, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, and `tp2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
