Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `tp2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff2` increments the value of `ans` by `diff2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
