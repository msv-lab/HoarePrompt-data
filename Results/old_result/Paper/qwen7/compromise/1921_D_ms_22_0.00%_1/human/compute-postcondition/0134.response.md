Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the last processed element, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`, `max_heap` is a heap containing either (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1 > diff2` or (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1 <= diff2`, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple into the `max_heap`. The tuple contains `-diff1`, the current value of `i`, and `0`. Since `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`, the value of `diff1` changes, but the values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `diff2`, `max_heap`, and `m` remain unchanged.
