Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` is a heap containing one tuple (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`).**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple into a max heap. The tuple consists of `-diff2`, which is the negative of the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `i` itself, and `m - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
