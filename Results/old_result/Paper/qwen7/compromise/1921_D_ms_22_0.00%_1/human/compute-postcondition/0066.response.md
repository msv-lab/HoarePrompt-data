The loop head condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop continues as long as `max_heap` is non-empty.

Given the postcondition and the loop head, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `max_heap` remains non-empty.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is non-empty at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`max_heap` is non-empty**
