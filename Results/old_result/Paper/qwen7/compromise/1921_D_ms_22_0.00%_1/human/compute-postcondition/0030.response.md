Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then a max heap contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, a max heap contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.
