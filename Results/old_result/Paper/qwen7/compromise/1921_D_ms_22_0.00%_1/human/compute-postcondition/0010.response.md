Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split(), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`.**

The code assigns the value of `m - 1` to `tp2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
