Postcondition: **`max_heap` is empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The variable `ans` holds the total minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of list `a` and the boundary elements of list `b` (either the first or the last element). The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted to cover the entire range of indices in `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**
