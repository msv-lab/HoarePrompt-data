Output State: **`i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the current `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the current `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff2` to be the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The comparison between `diff1` and `diff2` to determine the content of `max_heap` remains the same.
