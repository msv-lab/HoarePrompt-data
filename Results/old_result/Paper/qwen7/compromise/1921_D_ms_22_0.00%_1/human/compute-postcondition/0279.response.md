Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property.**

This means that the variable `diff1` has been calculated as the absolute difference between the second element of the `item` tuple (`item[1]`) and the element `b[tp1]`. The other variables remain in their initial state.
