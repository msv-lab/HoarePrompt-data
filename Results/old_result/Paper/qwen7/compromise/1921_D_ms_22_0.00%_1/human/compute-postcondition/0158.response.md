Output State: **`tp1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is 0. Additionally, the third element of `item` (index) is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`. The current value of `item[2]` is equal to `tp1 + 1`.**

This means that `tp1` has been incremented by 1, while the other conditions and the structure of `item` remain unchanged. The value of `item[2]` has also been updated to reflect the new value of `tp1`.
