Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the State of `a`**: Since `i` is being taken from `a`, the list `a` will lose its first element (the current `i`). Therefore, `a` will now be a list of integers that must contain at least one element (since it started with at least one element and lost one).

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.
- `a` will be the list `a` without its first element.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `i` is the second element of `a`**.

This ensures that the loop condition is met and the loop can continue executing.
