Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b.sort()
    max_heap = []
    tp1 = 0
    tp2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    for i in a:
        diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
        diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))
    while max_heap:
        item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
            diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
            diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
            if diff1 > diff2:
                tp1 += 1
                ans += diff1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
                ans += diff2
        else:
            ans += -item[0]
            if item[2] == tp1:
                tp1 += 1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` is empty, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, and both `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly until they cover the entire range of indices in `b`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `max_heap` is non-empty. During each iteration, the loop extracts the maximum item from `max_heap` and updates the value of `ans` based on certain conditions involving the elements of `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the third element of the extracted item (which indicates the position relative to `b`) is outside the current bounds defined by `tp1` and `tp2`, it calculates the maximum difference between the item's first element and the appropriate element in `b` and updates `ans` and the bounds accordingly. If the third element is within the bounds, it directly adds `-item[0]` to `ans` and adjusts the bounds. This process repeats until `max_heap` is empty, meaning all items have been processed, and `ans` holds the final result.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: After all iterations of the loop, the `max_heap` will be empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the minimum absolute differences found between elements of list `a` and either the first (`b[0]`) or the last (`b[m-1]`) element of list `b`. For each iteration, the loop ensures that the smallest positive difference is considered, adjusting `tp1` or `tp2` based on which difference is smaller. The process continues until all elements in `max_heap` have been processed, and `ans` reflects the cumulative sum of these minimum differences.

The final state of `ans` will be the total minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of list `a` and the boundary elements of list `b` (either the first or the last element), as determined by the logic within the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning that every element in the list `a` has been processed. For each element `i` in `a`, the differences `diff1` (absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`) and `diff2` (absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`) were calculated. Based on these differences, tuples of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` were pushed into the `max_heap`. After processing all elements in `a`, `max_heap` will contain up to `len(a)` such tuples, each representing the maximum difference found for each element in `a` with respect to the boundaries of `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.

The final state of the variables is as follows:
- `t`: A positive integer less than its original value by the number of iterations (length of `a`).
- `n`: Unchanged, the input integer.
- `m`: Unchanged, the input integer.
- `a`: Unchanged, the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `b`: Unchanged, the list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `max_heap`: Contains exactly `len(a)` tuples of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.
- `tp1`: A non-negative integer, initially set to 0, and incremented by 1 for each iteration where `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.
- `tp2`: An integer equal to `m - 1`, and decremented by 1 for each iteration where `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`.
- `ans`: An integer representing the sum of the absolute differences, updated during each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop body.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
