Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `n` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[0]`, `m` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[1]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `a` contains a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` in a max heap. Otherwise, `a` contains a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` in a max heap.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements; `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; `max_heap` is a heap containing either (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1 > diff2` or (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1 <= diff2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the last processed element, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between the new `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` is a heap containing either (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1 > diff2` or (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1 <= diff2`, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
