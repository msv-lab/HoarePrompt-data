The loop head condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

Given the postconditions from the previous iteration:
- `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.
- `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed.
- `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`), or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (otherwise).
- `tp1` is increased by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, and `tp2` is decreased by 1 if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`.
- `ans` is further increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1` after the adjustments.
- If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive) and does not equal `tp1`, then `tp2` is decreased by 1.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty after the current iteration. The only way to guarantee this is to ensure that `max_heap` still contains items.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `max_heap` is not empty.

State: **`max_heap` is not empty**
