Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, a tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) is pushed into the max heap. Otherwise, a tuple (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) is pushed into the max heap.
