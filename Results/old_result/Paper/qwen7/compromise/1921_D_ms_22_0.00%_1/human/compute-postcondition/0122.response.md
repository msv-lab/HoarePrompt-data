Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then a max heap contains a tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, 0). Otherwise, a max heap contains a tuple (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`).
