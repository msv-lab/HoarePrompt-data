Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`; `ans` is `ans` plus `diff2`.**

In this output state, the `max_heap` remains unchanged, `item` remains the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed, `diff1` remains the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` remains the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`. The variable `ans` has been updated to include the value of `diff2`.
