Output State: After all iterations of the loop, the `max_heap` will be empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the minimum absolute differences found between elements of list `a` and either the first (`b[0]`) or the last (`b[m-1]`) element of list `b`. For each iteration, the loop ensures that the smallest positive difference is considered, adjusting `tp1` or `tp2` based on which difference is smaller. The process continues until all elements in `max_heap` have been processed, and `ans` reflects the cumulative sum of these minimum differences.

The final state of `ans` will be the total minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of list `a` and the boundary elements of list `b` (either the first or the last element), as determined by the logic within the loop.
