Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `tp1` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += diff1` adds the value of `diff1` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
