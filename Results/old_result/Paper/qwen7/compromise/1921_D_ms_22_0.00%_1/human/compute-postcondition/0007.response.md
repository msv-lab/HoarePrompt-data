Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 99, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split(), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in non-decreasing order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
