Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `n` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[0]`, `m` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[1]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())**.

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
