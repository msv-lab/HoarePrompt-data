Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will be empty, indicating that all elements have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the minimum absolute differences found between each element in list `a` and either the first (`b[0]`) or the last (`b[m-1]`) element of list `b`, depending on which results in the smaller absolute difference for each element in `a`. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted to reflect the optimal positions in list `b` for each element in list `a` to minimize the absolute differences, ensuring that `ans` represents the minimal possible sum of these differences.
