Output State: **`i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the current `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the current `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a new tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` into the `max_heap`. Since `diff1` and `diff2` were previously determined, their values remain unchanged. The value of `i` also remains the same as it was in the initial state. The only change is the addition of the new tuple to `max_heap`.
