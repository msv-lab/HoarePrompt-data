Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` are adjusted accordingly until they cover the entire range of indices in `b`, `n` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[0]`, `m` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[1]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The line `tp1 = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `tp1`. No other changes are made to the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `tp1` and retains the rest of the initial state unchanged.
