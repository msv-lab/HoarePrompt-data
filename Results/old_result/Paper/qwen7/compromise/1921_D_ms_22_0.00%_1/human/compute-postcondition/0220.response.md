Output State: **`i` is the first element of the list `a`, `t` is a positive integer less than the original value of `t` by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**

The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions involving `diff1` and `diff2` are preserved.
