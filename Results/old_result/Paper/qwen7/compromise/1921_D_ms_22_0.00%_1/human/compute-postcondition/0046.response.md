Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, the third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is increased by 1.**

The value of `tp1` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition regarding the third element of `item` being either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2` remains valid. The differences `diff1` and `diff2` are also unaffected by this operation.
