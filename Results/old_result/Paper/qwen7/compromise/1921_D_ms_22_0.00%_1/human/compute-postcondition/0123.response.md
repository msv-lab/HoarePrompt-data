Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `a` contains a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` in a max heap. Otherwise, `a` contains a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` in a max heap.
