Output State: **`tp1` is incremented by 1, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

Explanation: The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. The other variables (`diff1`, `max_heap`, `item`, and `diff2`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `tp1` is updated to its new value, while the rest of the variables retain their original descriptions.
