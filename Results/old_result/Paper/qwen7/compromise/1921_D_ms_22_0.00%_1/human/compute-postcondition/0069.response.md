Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`**.

The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` and assigns it to `diff2`. The value of `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, `b[tp1]`, and `b[tp2]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
