Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The code `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. The value of `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped, so `item[0]` represents this highest value. After executing this line, `ans` will have its value updated by subtracting the value of `item[0]`. The `max_heap` does not contain the item that was just popped, which remains unchanged by this operation.
