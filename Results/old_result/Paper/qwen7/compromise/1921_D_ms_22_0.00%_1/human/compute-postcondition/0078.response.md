Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty; `ans` is increased by the value `-item[0]`, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. The value of `max_heap` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial state of `ans` being increased by the value `-item[0]` is still valid, where `item[0]` is the highest value item removed from `max_heap`.
