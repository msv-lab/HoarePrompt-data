Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

This means that after executing the line of code, `diff1` has been calculated as the absolute difference between the second element of the `item` tuple (which was the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped) and the value at index `tp1` in the list `b`. The other variables remain in their initial state.
