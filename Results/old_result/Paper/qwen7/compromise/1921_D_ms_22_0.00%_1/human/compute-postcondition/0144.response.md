Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. The current value of `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`; `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.
