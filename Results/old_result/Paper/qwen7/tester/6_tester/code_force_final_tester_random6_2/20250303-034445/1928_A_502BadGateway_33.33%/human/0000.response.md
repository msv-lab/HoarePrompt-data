# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 1x1 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, so no other rectangle can be formed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 2x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which do not form any new distinct rectangle.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 6x3 rectangle can be cut into two 6x1.5 rectangles, but since we are dealing with integer side lengths, it cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 10x10 rectangle can be cut into two 10x5 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 5x20 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 1x1000000000 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, so no other rectangle can be formed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: A 1000000000x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1000000000 rectangles, which do not form any new distinct rectangle.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: A 1000000000x1000000000 rectangle can be cut into two 500000000x1000000000 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1000000000x500000000 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
Yes
Yes
```
**Explanation**: 
- A 1x2 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, so no other rectangle can be formed.
- A 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 2x2 rectangle, which is the same but still counts as forming a new configuration.
- A 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1.5 rectangles, but since we are dealing with integer side lengths, it cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle. However, it can be cut into two 1.5x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 3x3 rectangle, which is the same but still counts as forming a new configuration.
