# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks will form a degenerate triangle since their lengths are equal. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 7 is given by the combination formula \( C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35 \).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations are (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4). However, since the lengths are powers of 2, no combination can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of any two sides is not greater than the third side.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 4, and 8 respectively. No combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of any two sides is not greater than the third side.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, and we need to choose 3 sticks to form a triangle, which is impossible.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 6 is \( C(6, 3) = 20 \). For the second test case, there are no valid combinations since the lengths are consecutive powers of 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 5 is \( C(5, 3) = 10 \). All combinations of 3 sticks will form a degenerate triangle since their lengths are either the same or differ by a small amount.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks of the same length, and the number of ways to choose 3 out of 3 is \( C(3, 3) = 1 \).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations are (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 2), (1, 1, 2), and (1, 1, 2) again, but since order does not matter, it counts as 4 unique combinations.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks of the same length, and the number of ways to choose 3 out of 3 is \( C(3, 3) = 1 \).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The valid combination is (0, 0, 1), and the number of ways to choose 3 out of 3 is \( C(3, 3) = 1 \).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The valid combination is (1, 1, 2), and the number of ways to choose 3 out of 3 is \( C(3, 3) = 1 \).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 4, 8, and 16 respectively. No combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of any two sides is not greater than the third side.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 1, 2, and 4 respectively. No combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of any two sides is not greater than the third side.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The valid combination is (1, 1, 3), and the number of ways to choose 3 out of 3 is \( C(3, 3) = 1 \).

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 4, and 8 respectively. No combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of any two sides is not greater than the third side.
