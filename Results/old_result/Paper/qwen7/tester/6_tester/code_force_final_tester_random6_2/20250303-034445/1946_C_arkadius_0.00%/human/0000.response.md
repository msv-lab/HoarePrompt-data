**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: After removing the edge between nodes 1 and 3, the tree splits into two components: one with 2 nodes (nodes 1 and 2) and another with 3 nodes (nodes 3, 4, and 5). The smallest component has 2 nodes, so the output is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: After removing the only edge, the tree splits into two components, each with 1 node. The smallest component has 1 node, so the output is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```

6 1
1 2

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: After removing any edge, the tree splits into components of sizes 1, 1, 1, 2, and 1. The smallest component has 1 node, so the output is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: After removing the edge between nodes 1 and 2, the tree splits into two components: one with 1 node (node 3) and another with 2 nodes (nodes 1 and 2). The smallest component has 1 node, but since we need at least x nodes in each component, the output is 2.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 2
1 2
1 3

**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: After removing two edges, the tree can split into components of sizes 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, and 1. The smallest component has 1 node, so the output is 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: After removing two edges, the tree can split into components of sizes 2, 2, and 2. The smallest component has 2 nodes, so the output is 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3
1 2
1 3
1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: After removing three edges, the tree splits into four components, each with 1 node. The smallest component has 1 node, so the output is 1.

```
*Explanation*: After removing four edges, the tree can split into components of sizes 2, 2, 2, and 4. The smallest component has 2 nodes, so the output is 2.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1

2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: After removing four edges, the tree splits into five components, each with 1 node. The smallest component has 1 node, so the output is 1.

*Explanation*: For the first set, after removing the edge between nodes 1 and 3, the tree splits into components of sizes 2 and 3. The smallest component has 2 nodes, so the output is 2. For the second set, after removing the edge between nodes 1 and 2, the tree splits into components of sizes 1, 1, 2, and 2. The smallest component has 1 node, so the output is 1.
