# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: Since \(b\) can be any value from 1 to 2000000, the pairs are (a, 1) for all \(1 \leq a \leq 2000000\), which gives us 2000000 pairs.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: Since \(a\) can be any value from 1 to 2000000, the pairs are (1, b) for all \(1 \leq b \leq 1\), which gives us 2000000 pairs.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: Each \(a\) from 1 to 2000000 can form a pair with \(b = 1\), giving us 2000000 pairs.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
