# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is `s = [2, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 3]`, resulting in penalties `p(s) = 2` and `p(t) = 1`.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in penalties `p(s) = 0` and `p(t) = 1`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array is sorted, so any split will result in no increasing pairs in either subsequence.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array has only one element, so there are no increasing pairs.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array is already sorted, so splitting it into two empty subsequences results in no increasing pairs.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
4
1 2 3 4
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0
```
*Explanation*: The first test case is identical to the first example, resulting in a penalty of 3. The second test case is identical to the third example, resulting in a penalty of 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: The array is sorted, so the optimal split is to keep it as one sequence, resulting in a penalty of 9.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array is reverse-sorted, so the optimal split is to keep it as one sequence, resulting in no increasing pairs.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: All elements are the same, so any split will result in no increasing pairs.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 3 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is `s = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` and `t = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, resulting in penalties `p(s) = 4` and `p(t) = 1`.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array alternates between decreasing and constant values, so the optimal split is to keep it as one sequence, resulting in no increasing pairs.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is `s = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and `t = [2]`, resulting in penalties `p(s) = 0` and `p(t) = 0`.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The array alternates between two values, so the optimal split is to keep it as one sequence, resulting in no increasing pairs.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is `s = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` and `t = [2]`, resulting in penalties `p(s) = 3` and `p(t) = 1`.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The optimal split is `s = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]` and `t = [3, 1]`, resulting in penalties `p(s) = 2` and `p(t) = 1`.
