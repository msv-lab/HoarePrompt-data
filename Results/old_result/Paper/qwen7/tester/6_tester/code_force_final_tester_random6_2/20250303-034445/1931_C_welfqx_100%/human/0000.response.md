To address the given problem, we need to implement a solution that finds the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal using at most one operation. Here are the comprehensive test cases, including both basic and edge scenarios:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the simplest case where all elements are already equal.
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has only one element.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has two elements and they are different.
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has multiple elements and they are already equal.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has multiple elements and they are not equal but can be made equal with one operation.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is very large and all elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is very large and all elements are different.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 3 ... 200000 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
199999
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array is very large and has a few different elements.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 ... (repeated 40000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
100000
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a repeating pattern.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 1 2 1 2 ... (repeated 100000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
100000
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single unique element repeated.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 1 ... 1 (199999 times), 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single unique element at the end.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 1 ... 1 (199999 times), 200000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single unique element at the beginning.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
200000 1 1 1 ... 1 (199998 times)
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single unique element in the middle.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1 (99999 times), 200000, 1 1 1 ... 1 (99999 times)
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single unique element surrounded by the same elements.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1 (99998 times), 200000, 1 1 1 ... 1 (99998 times)
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the case where the array has a single unique element in the middle of a large segment.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1 (99998 times), 200000, 1 1 1 ... 1 (99998 times), 1 1 1 ... 1 (99998 times)
```
**Output**:
```
3
```

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
