# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2
```
**Comment**: This is the basic test case for \( n = 2 \). We need to place two cells in such a way that the Manhattan distance between them is maximized, which is 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
**Comment**: For \( n = 3 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the cells in positions (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1) to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, which includes 0, 1, and 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
**Comment**: For \( n = 4 \), the optimal arrangement involves placing cells in positions (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), and (4,4) to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, which includes 0, 1, 2, and 3.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 3
1 4
2 1
5 5
```
**Comment**: For \( n = 5 \), the optimal arrangement involves placing cells in positions (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), and (5,5) to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, which includes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1
```
**Comment**: For \( n = 6 \), the optimal arrangement involves placing cells in positions (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), and (6,1) to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, which includes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2

2 1
2 3
3 1
```
**Comment**: This test case checks the function for multiple test cases within a single input. It verifies if the function can handle and process multiple \( n \) values correctly.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1000
1000 1
1000 1000
```
**Comment**: This edge case tests the function with the maximum value of \( n \) (1000). The optimal arrangement here would be to place cells in positions (1,1), (1,1000), (1000,1), and (1000,1000) to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, which includes 0, 999.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2
```
**Comment**: This test case is repeated to ensure consistency and correctness of the output when the same input is provided again.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
**Comment**: This test case is also repeated to ensure consistency and correctness of the output when the same input is provided again.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
