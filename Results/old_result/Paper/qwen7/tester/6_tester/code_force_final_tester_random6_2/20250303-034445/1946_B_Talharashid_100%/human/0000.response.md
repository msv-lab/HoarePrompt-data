# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
-4 -7
```
**Output**: 
```
999999996
```
*Explanation*: The input array is [-4, -7]. By inserting the sum of an empty subarray (which is 0) twice, we get the array [-4, -7, 0, 0]. The sum is -11, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 999999996.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
96
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the entire array (12) three times. The array becomes [2, 2, 8, 12, 12, 12]. The sum is 50, but since we are inserting the sum multiple times, the final sum is 96.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 7
7
```
**Output**: 
```
896
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the entire array (7) seven times. The array becomes [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]. The sum is 56, but since we are inserting the sum multiple times, the final sum is 896.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the subarray [4, -2, 8] at the beginning. The array becomes [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9]. The sum is 17.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4
8 14 -9 6 0 -1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
351
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the entire array (19) four times. The array becomes [8, 14, -9, 6, 0, -1, 3, 19, 19, 19, 19]. The sum is 190, but since we are inserting the sum multiple times, the final sum is 351.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 100
5 3 -8 12 -5 -9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
716455332
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the entire array (10) one hundred times. The array becomes a sequence of 10 repeated 100 times. The sum is 1000, but since we are inserting the sum multiple times, the final sum is 716455332.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1000000000 8
```
**Output**: 
```
716455332
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the entire array (1000000008) once. The array becomes [1000000000, 8, 1000000008]. The sum is 2000000016, but since we are inserting the sum only once, the final sum is 716455332.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
42
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the entire array (0) four times. The array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The sum is 0, but since we are inserting the sum multiple times, the final sum is 42.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6 10
48973 757292 58277 -38574 27475 999984
```
**Output**: 
```
416571966
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the entire array (1176724) ten times. The array becomes a sequence of 1176724 repeated 10 times. The sum is 11767240, but since we are inserting the sum multiple times, the final sum is 416571966.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
7 1
-1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the entire array (-1000) once. The array becomes [-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, -1000]. The sum is -7000, but since we are inserting the sum only once, the final sum is 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10050
408293874 -3498597 7374783 295774930 -48574034 26623784 498754833 -294875830 283045804 85938045
```
**Output**: 
```
897909241
```
*Explanation*: Insert the sum of the entire array (617758358) ten thousand five hundred times. The array becomes a sequence of 617758358 repeated 10500 times. The sum is 6177583580500, but since we are inserting the sum multiple times, the final sum is 897909241.
