### Test Case 8: Graph with All Edges Removed Except One
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a graph where almost all edges are removed except one.

**Input**:
```

**Explanation**: This test case checks the function on a graph with 4 vertices where almost all edges are removed except one. The expected Hamiltonian path is 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.

### Test Case 9: Graph with Random Edges Removed
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a graph with random edges removed.

**Explanation**: This test case checks the function on a graph with 6 vertices where few edges are removed. The expected Hamiltonian path is 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios, from small to large graphs, and from graphs with few edges removed to those with almost all edges removed. They help ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
