**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 3 \), the optimal arrangement is to place cells at (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1). The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), making the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) equal to 4.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```

1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 6 \), the optimal arrangement is to place cells at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). The Manhattan distances include all values from 0 to 9, making the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) equal to 10.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2

2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: This test checks the function for two different \( n \) values in a single input. It verifies if the function can handle multiple test cases correctly.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
5

1 4
2 1
5 5

1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1
```
*Explanation*: This test checks the function for multiple \( n \) values in a single input, ensuring the function can handle a series of test cases without issues.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1000
1000 1
1000 1000
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 1000 \), the optimal arrangement is to place cells at (1,1), (1,1000), (1000,1), and (1000,1000). The Manhattan distances include all values from 0 to 1998, making the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) equal to 1999.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2
```
*Explanation*: This is a duplicate of Test 1, but included to ensure the function handles repeated inputs consistently.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: This is a duplicate of Test 2, but included to ensure the function handles repeated inputs consistently.

These test cases cover basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the function's robustness and reliability across a range of inputs.
