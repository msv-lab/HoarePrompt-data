# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle since all sticks have the same length. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is given by the combination formula \(C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\). The valid combinations to form a triangle are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 3).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\). No combination of these sticks can form a triangle because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, and it is impossible to form a triangle with just one stick.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, there are 6 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\). The number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle is calculated by counting valid combinations, which results in 20. For the second test case, the sticks have lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\), and no combination can form a triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: There are 5 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^0, 2^1, 2^1, 2^2\). The valid combinations to form a triangle are (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 2), counted multiple times due to repetition of lengths, resulting in 8 ways.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
8
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
56
```
**Explanation**: There are 8 sticks, all with the same length \(2^2\). Any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle, and the number of ways is \(C(8, 3) = 56\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 2 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1\). No combination of these sticks can form a triangle.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length \(2^0\). No combination of these sticks can form a triangle.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks, all with the same length \(2^1\). The valid combinations to form a triangle are (1, 1, 1), counted multiple times due to repetition, resulting in 4 ways.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, ensuring the solution handles various inputs correctly.
