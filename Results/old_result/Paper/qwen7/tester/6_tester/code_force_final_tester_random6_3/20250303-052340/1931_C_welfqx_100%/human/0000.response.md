To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### 1. Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array has multiple segments with different values.

**Input**:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: We can change the segment from index 2 to 4 to value 1, which costs \( (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 \) burles, and then change the last element to 1, which costs 1 burle. Total cost: 4 burles.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array is already uniform.

**Input**:
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array has a segment of identical values.

**Input**:
```
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: We can change the segment from index 3 to 5 to value 8, which costs \( (5 - 3 + 1) = 3 \) burles, but since we only need to change two elements, the minimum cost is 2 burles.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array has only one element.

**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array has only one element, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array has two elements and they are different.

**Input**:
```
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: We can change the entire array to either 1 or 2, which costs 1 burle.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array has three elements and they are all different.

**Input**:
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: We can change the entire array to either 1, 2, or 3, which costs 1 burle.

### 2. Edge Test Cases

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array is very large and has a segment of identical values.

**Input**:
```
8
4 3 2 7 1 1 3 7
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: We can change the segment from index 4 to 6 to value 1, which costs \( (6 - 4 + 1) = 3 \) burles, and then change the last element to 1, which costs 3 burles. Total cost: 6 burles.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array is very large and has a segment of identical values at the beginning.

**Input**:
```
9
9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Explanation**: We can change the segment from index 2 to 4 to value 9, which costs \( (4 - 2 + 1) = 3 \) burles, and then change the segment from index 6 to 8 to value 5, which costs \( (8 - 6 + 1) = 3 \) burles, and finally change the last element to 5, which costs 1 burle. Total cost: 7 burles.
