# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `k` equals `m`, meaning all elements must match.

**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```

# Test 2

5 4 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `k` is equal to 1, meaning only one element needs to match.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 1
1 2 3 4 5
3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `b` is a subset of `a` but `k` is greater than the number of occurrences of any element in `b`.

**Input**:

1
5 3 1
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `a` and `b` have some common elements but `k` is not met.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `a` and `b` have some common elements but `k` is met.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `a` and `b` have all elements from `b` present in `a` but in different order.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 3
1 2 3 4 5
4 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `a` and `b` have all elements from `b` present in `a` but in different order and `k` is less than `m`.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
4 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `a` and `b` have all elements from `b` present in `a` but in different order and `k` is equal to `m`.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 3
1 2 3 4 5
4 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```

# Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `a` and `b` have all elements from `b` present in `a` but in different order and `k` is more than the number of occurrences of any element in `b`.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
4 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

1
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
4 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```

# Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when `a` and `b` have all elements from `b` present in `a` but in different order and `k` is exactly the number of occurrences of any element in `b`.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 3
