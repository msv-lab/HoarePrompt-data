# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where we have to generate a single number that sums to 5, and it must be 5 itself.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate two numbers that sum to 3. The combination 1 and 2 satisfies both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition since \(1 \text{ OR } 2 = 3\) in binary, which is \(11_2\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5 0
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate two numbers that sum to 5. The combination 5 and 0 satisfies both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition since \(5 \text{ OR } 0 = 5\) in binary, which is \(101_2\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 51
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate six numbers that sum to 51. The combination 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, and 12 satisfies both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition since \(3 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 32 \text{ OR } 2 \text{ OR } 12 = 47\) in binary, which is \(101\,111_2\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
*Explanation*: Two separate test cases where we generate a single number that sums to 1 and 2, respectively. The outputs are 1 and 2, which directly satisfy the sum conditions.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1023
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1023
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate ten numbers that sum to 1023. The combination 1 repeated nine times and 1023 satisfies both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition since \(1 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 1 \text{ OR } 1023 = 1023\) in binary, which is \(11\,111\,111\,111_2\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 0
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate two numbers that sum to 1. The combination 1 and 0 satisfies both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition since \(1 \text{ OR } 0 = 1\) in binary, which is \(1_2\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate two numbers that sum to 2. The combination 1 and 1 satisfies both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition since \(1 \text{ OR } 1 = 1\) in binary, which is \(1_2\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate a single number that sums to 1000000000. The output is 1000000000, which directly satisfies the sum condition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000 0
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate two numbers that sum to 1000000000. The combination 1000000000 and 0 satisfies both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition since \(1000000000 \text{ OR } 0 = 1000000000\) in binary.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000001
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate a single number that sums to 1000000001. The output is 1000000001, which directly satisfies the sum condition.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000001 0
```
*Explanation*: We need to generate two numbers that sum to 1000000001. The combination 1000000001 and 0 satisfies both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition since \(1000000001 \text{ OR } 0 = 1000000001\) in binary.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios from simple to complex, ensuring the solution handles various inputs correctly.
