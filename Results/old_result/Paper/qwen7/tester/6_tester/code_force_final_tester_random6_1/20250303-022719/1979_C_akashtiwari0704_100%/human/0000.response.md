# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12 
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the number of outcomes is 3 and the multipliers are 3, 2, and 7. The solution provided meets the criteria as the total bet (80) is less than the winnings for each outcome (81, 82, 84).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is another basic test case with 2 outcomes and multipliers 3 and 3. The solution provided (1 coin each) ensures the total bet (2) is less than the winnings for each outcome (3, 3).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case has 5 outcomes with the same multiplier (5). Since the multiplier is the same for all outcomes, it is impossible to find a distribution where the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This is a more complex case with 6 outcomes and different multipliers. The solution provided meets the criteria as the total bet (7500) is less than the winnings for each outcome (13923, 17923, 13923, 13923, 13923, 13923).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case has 3 outcomes with multipliers 6, 3, and 2. Since the smallest multiplier is 2, it is impossible to find a distribution where the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24 
```
*Explanation*: This is a case with 5 outcomes and different multipliers. The solution provided meets the criteria as the total bet (62) is less than the winnings for each outcome (81, 64, 72, 80, 72).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic case with only 1 outcome and a multiplier of 2. The solution provided (1 coin) ensures the total bet (1) is less than the winnings (2).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case has 10 outcomes with the same multiplier (10). Since the multiplier is the same for all outcomes, it is impossible to find a distribution where the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic case with only 1 outcome and a multiplier of 20. The solution provided (1 coin) ensures the total bet (1) is less than the winnings (20).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: This is a duplicate of Test 7, ensuring consistency in handling the simplest case.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
1
3
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case includes two sub-cases. The first sub-case has 1 outcome with a multiplier of 3, and the solution provided (1 coin) ensures the total bet (1) is less than the winnings (3). The second sub-case has 1 outcome with a multiplier of 5, which also results in a solution of 1 coin.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
3
2
3 3
3
5 5 5
5
7 9 3 17 9
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
-1
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 
```
*Explanation*: This test case includes three sub-cases. The first sub-case has 2 outcomes with multipliers 3 and 3, and the solution provided (1 coin each) ensures the total bet (2) is less than the winnings for each outcome (3, 3). The second sub-case has 3 outcomes with the same multiplier (5), resulting in an impossible solution (-1). The third sub-case has 5 outcomes with different multipliers, and the solution provided meets the criteria as the total bet (7500) is less than the winnings for each outcome (13923, 17923, 13923, 13923, 13923).
