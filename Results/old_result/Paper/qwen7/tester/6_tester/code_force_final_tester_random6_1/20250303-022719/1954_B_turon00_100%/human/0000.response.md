### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array is already uniform.
**Input**:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform and cannot be made non-uniform by removing any elements.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a simple alternating pattern.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the element at index 3 (value 1) results in the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is no longer beautiful.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a single-element array.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: A single-element array is trivially not beautiful and cannot be modified to become non-beautiful by removing any elements.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a larger uniform array.
**Input**:
```
1
6
3 3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is uniform and cannot be made non-uniform by removing any elements.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a larger alternating pattern.
**Input**:
```
1
9
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Removing the elements at indices 2, 4, 6, and 8 results in the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which is no longer beautiful.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a very large uniform array.
**Input**:
```
1
300000
1 1 1 ... 1 (300000 ones)
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is uniform and cannot be made non-uniform by removing any elements.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a very large alternating pattern.
**Input**:
```
1
300000
1 2 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 1 (150000 ones and 150000 twos)
```
**Output**:
```
150000
```
**Explanation**: Removing half of the elements (all the 1s or all the 2s) results in the array consisting of only one type of element, which is no longer beautiful.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a mixed pattern with a single non-matching element.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array has a single non-matching element (3), and removing it would not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining elements still form a beautiful pattern.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a mixed pattern with multiple non-matching elements.
**Input**:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Removing the elements at indices 3, 4, and 5 results in the array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, which is no longer beautiful.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a mixed pattern with a single non-matching element at the end.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the last element (5) results in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is no longer beautiful.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
