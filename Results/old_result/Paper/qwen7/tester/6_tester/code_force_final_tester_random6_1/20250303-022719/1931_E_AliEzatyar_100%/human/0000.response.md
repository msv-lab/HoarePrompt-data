To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Here's a detailed breakdown of the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Simple Case with Small Numbers
**Objective**: Verify the function works with small numbers and simple operations.

**Input**:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 2 to get 2, and Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Anna has no other options and loses.

#### Test 2: Simple Case with Larger Numbers
**Objective**: Verify the function works with larger numbers but still straightforward.

**Input**:
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to get 1, and Sasha can concatenate 9 and 56 to get 956, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna can reverse 56 to get 65, and Sasha can concatenate 9 and 65 to get 965, which is also greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna can reverse 9 to get 9, and Sasha can concatenate 56 and 1 to get 561, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna can reverse 561 to get 165, and Sasha can concatenate 9 and 165 to get 9165, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna has no other options and loses.

#### Test 3: Case with Equal Elements
**Objective**: Verify the function handles cases where all elements are the same.

**Input**:
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to get 1, and Sasha can concatenate 2007 and 800 to get 2007800, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 800 to get 800, and Sasha can concatenate 2007 and 1580 to get 20071580, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 1580 to get 851, and Sasha can concatenate 2007 and 1 to get 20071, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna has no other options and loses.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4: Single Element List
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a single-element list correctly.

**Input**:
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: With only one element, Anna cannot make a move, and Sasha wins since the number is not less than \(10^1 = 10\).

#### Test 5: Large List with Small Values
**Objective**: Verify the function handles large lists with small values correctly.

**Input**:
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to get 1, and Sasha can concatenate 6 and 4 to get 64, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 4 to get 4, and Sasha can concatenate 6 and 6 to get 66, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 6 to get 6, and Sasha can concatenate 6 and 2 to get 62, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 2 to get 2, and Sasha can concatenate 6 and 3 to get 63, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 3 to get 3, and Sasha can concatenate 6 and 1 to get 61, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 1 to get 1, and Sasha can concatenate 6 and 10 to get 610, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 10 to get 10, and Sasha can concatenate 6 and 9 to get 69, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 9 to get 9, and Sasha can concatenate 6 and 10 to get 610, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can reverse 10 to get 10, and Sasha can concatenate 6 and 7 to get 67, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna has no other options and loses.

#### Test 6: List with All Zeros
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a list with all zeros correctly.

**Input**:
```
1
5 5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 0 to get 0, and Sasha can concatenate 0 and 0 to get 00, which is not valid (leading zero). Anna can reverse 0 to get 0, and Sasha can concatenate 0 and 0 to get 00, which is not valid. Anna can reverse 0 to get 0, and Sasha can concatenate 0 and 0 to get 00, which is not valid. Anna can reverse 0 to get 0, and Sasha can concatenate 0 and 0 to get 00, which is not valid. Anna can reverse 0 to get 0, and Sasha can concatenate 0 and 0 to get 00, which is not valid. Anna has no other options and loses.

#### Test 7: List with One Large Number
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a list with one large number correctly.

**Input**:
```
1
2 10
8 9
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 9 to get 9, and Sasha can concatenate 8 and 9 to get 89, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna has no other options and loses.
