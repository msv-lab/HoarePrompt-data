# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 2 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points in (1,1) and (1,2). The Manhattan distances are {0, 1}, so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 3 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points in (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1). The Manhattan distances are {0, 1, 2, 3}, so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 4 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points in (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), and (4,4). The Manhattan distances are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 3
1 4
2 1
5 5
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 5 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points in (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), and (5,5). The Manhattan distances include all values from 0 to 8, so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 9.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 6 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points in (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), and (6,1). The Manhattan distances include all values from 0 to 10, so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 11.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2

2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the function for two different values of \( n \) in a single input. The outputs are the optimal arrangements for \( n = 2 \) and \( n = 3 \) respectively.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```

2 1
5 5

1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the function for multiple values of \( n \) in a single input. The outputs are the optimal arrangements for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \) respectively.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1000
1000 1
1000 1000
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 1000 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points in (1,1), (1,1000), (1000,1), and (1000,1000). The Manhattan distances include all values from 0 to 1998, so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 1999.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2000
2000 1
2000 2000
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 2000 \), the optimal arrangement is to place the points in (1,1), (1,2000), (2000,1), and (2000,2000). The Manhattan distances include all values from 0 to 3998, so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3999.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 1 \), the only point is (1,1), so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 0 since there are no pairs of points to calculate distances between.

These test cases cover basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
