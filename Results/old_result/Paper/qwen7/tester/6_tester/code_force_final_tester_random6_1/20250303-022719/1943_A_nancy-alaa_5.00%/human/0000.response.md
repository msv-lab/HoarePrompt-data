# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
0
```
*Explanation*: This test case directly corresponds to the provided example in the problem statement. It checks the basic functionality of the game logic and the calculation of the MEX.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This is a very small input where only one element is present. Alice will pick it, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: In this case, Alice can pick either 0 or 1. If she picks 0, the MEX of the resulting array will be 1. If she picks 1, the MEX will also be 1. Thus, the optimal strategy results in a MEX of 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Here, Alice can pick any of the three elements. Regardless of her choice, Bob will pick the remaining two elements, and the MEX of the resulting array will be 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice can pick 0, and Bob will pick 2 and 1. Then Alice will pick 3, leaving the array c = [0, 3], and the MEX will be 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice can pick 0, and Bob will pick 1, 2, 3, and 4 in some order. The resulting array c will have MEX as 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Similar to the previous test case, Alice can pick 0, and Bob will pick the rest, resulting in MEX as 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice can pick 0, and Bob will pick the rest, resulting in MEX as 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice can pick 0, and Bob will pick the rest, resulting in MEX as 1.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
9
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice can pick 0, and Bob will pick the rest, resulting in MEX as 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice can pick 0, and Bob will pick the rest, resulting in MEX as 1.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This is the same as Test 2, but included for completeness.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice will pick one 1, and Bob will pick the other, resulting in c = [1], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice will pick one 1, and Bob will pick the other two, resulting in c = [1, 1], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice will pick one 1, and Bob will pick the other three, resulting in c = [1, 1, 1], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice will pick one 1, and Bob will pick the other four, resulting in c = [1, 1, 1, 1], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice will pick one 1, and Bob will pick the other five, resulting in c = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice will pick one 1, and Bob will pick the other six, resulting in c = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice will pick one 1, and Bob will pick the other seven, resulting in c = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and the MEX is 0.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
9
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice will pick one 1, and Bob will pick the other eight, resulting in c = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and the MEX is 0.
