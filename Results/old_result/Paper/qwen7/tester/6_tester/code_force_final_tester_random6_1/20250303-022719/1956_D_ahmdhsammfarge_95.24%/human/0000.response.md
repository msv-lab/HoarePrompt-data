To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will focus on both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple array where all elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
3 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already optimal, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple array where all elements are different.
**Input**:
```
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already optimal, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple array where all elements are zeros.
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0 1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: We can set all elements to 1 to get the maximum sum.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple array where all elements are the same but greater than 0.
**Input**:
```
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
6 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already optimal, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple array where all elements are the same but greater than 0 and the length is 1.
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
5 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: We can set the single element to 1 to get the maximum sum.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with an array where all elements are the same but very large.
**Input**:
```
3
10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
30000000 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already optimal, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with an array where all elements are the same but very large and the length is 1.
**Input**:
```
1
10000000
```
**Output**:
```
10000000 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: We can set the single element to 1 to get the maximum sum.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with an array where all elements are the same but very large and the length is 18.
**Input**:
```
18
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
180000000 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already optimal, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with an array where all elements are the same but very large and the length is 18, and we need to perform multiple operations.
**Input**:
```
18
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
180000000 17
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
10 11
11 12
12 13
13 14
14 15
15 16
16 17
17 18
```
**Explanation**: We can set each segment of the array to 1 to get the maximum sum.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with an array where all elements are the same but very large and the length is 18, and we need to perform multiple operations but some segments are already optimal.
**Input**:
```
18
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
180000000 17
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10

11 12
12 13
13 14
14 15
15 16
16 17
17 18
```
**Explanation**: We can set each segment of the array to 1 to get the maximum sum.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, from simple and straightforward to complex and edge cases, ensuring the solution's robustness and reliability.
