Given the nature of the problem, we need to create comprehensive test cases that cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution. Here are the test cases:

### Test 1: Small Graph with Removed Edges
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a small graph with some edges removed.

**Input**:
```

! 4 3 1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality with a small graph where the edges are removed in a way that still allows for a Hamiltonian path.

### Test 2: Medium Graph with Multiple Removed Edges
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a medium-sized graph with multiple edges removed.

**Input**:
```

**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's performance on a large graph where only a few edges remain, ensuring it can still find a Hamiltonian path.

### Test 4: Graph with All Edges Removed Except One
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when only one edge remains.

**Input**:
```
3
3
```
**Output**:
```
? 2
? 1
! 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a graph where almost all edges are removed, leaving only one edge.

### Test 5: Graph with No Edges Removed (Complete Graph)
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when no edges are removed.

**Input**:
```
3
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 1 2 3 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior on a complete graph, ensuring it can handle the trivial case where no edges are removed.

### Test 6: Graph with Edges Removed in a Specific Pattern
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when edges are removed in a specific pattern that might confuse the algorithm.

**Input**:
```
3
5
```
**Output**:
```
? 4
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a graph where edges are removed in a pattern that might lead to confusion, ensuring it can still find a Hamiltonian path.

### Test 7: Graph with Only Two Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for the smallest possible graph.

**Input**:
```
3
2
```
**Output**:
```
? 1
! 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior on the smallest possible graph, ensuring it can handle the simplest case.

### Test 8: Graph with Randomly Removed Edges
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a graph with randomly removed edges.

**Input**:
```
3
7
```
**Output**:
```
? 6
? 5
? 4
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a graph with randomly removed edges, ensuring it can still find a Hamiltonian path.

### Test 9: Graph with All Edges Removed Except One Loop
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when only one loop remains.

**Input**:
```
3
3
```
**Output**:
```
? 2
? 1
! 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a graph where only one loop remains, ensuring it can still find a Hamiltonian path.

### Test 10: Graph with All Edges Removed Except One Path
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when only one path remains.

**Input**:
```
3
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 4 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a graph where only one path remains, ensuring it can still find a Hamiltonian path.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, from small to large graphs, and from simple to complex edge removal patterns, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
