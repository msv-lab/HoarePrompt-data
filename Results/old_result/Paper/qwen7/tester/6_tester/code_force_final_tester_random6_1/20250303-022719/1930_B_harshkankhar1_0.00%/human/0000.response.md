To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small, manageable permutation size.
**Input**:
```
3
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: This is a simple permutation of length 3 where no two elements satisfy the divisibility condition.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a medium-sized permutation.
**Input**:
```
4
```
**Output**:
```
4 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: This permutation is valid as no two elements satisfy the divisibility condition.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a larger permutation.
**Input**:
```
5
```
**Output**:
```
5 1 2 3 4
```
**Explanation**: This permutation is valid as no two elements satisfy the divisibility condition.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum allowed permutation size.
**Input**:
```
3
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: This is the smallest possible permutation and must be valid.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with the maximum allowed permutation size.
**Input**:
```
100000
```
**Output**:
```
100000 1 2 3 ... 99998 99999
```
**Explanation**: This permutation is valid as no two elements satisfy the divisibility condition. Note: The actual output would be a very large list, but the logic remains the same.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a permutation where elements are in reverse order.
**Input**:
```
4
```
**Output**:
```
4 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This permutation is valid as no two elements satisfy the divisibility condition.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a permutation where elements are in ascending order.
**Input**:
```
4
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4
```
**Explanation**: This permutation is valid as no two elements satisfy the divisibility condition.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a permutation where elements are in a specific pattern.
**Input**:
```
5
```
**Output**:
```
5 1 3 2 4
```
**Explanation**: This permutation is valid as no two elements satisfy the divisibility condition.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a permutation where elements are in a mixed pattern.
**Input**:
```
6
```
**Output**:
```
6 1 2 3 5 4
```
**Explanation**: This permutation is valid as no two elements satisfy the divisibility condition.

### Summary
These test cases cover a range of scenarios from small to large permutations, including edge cases and specific patterns. Each test case ensures that the solution is robust and reliable under various conditions.
