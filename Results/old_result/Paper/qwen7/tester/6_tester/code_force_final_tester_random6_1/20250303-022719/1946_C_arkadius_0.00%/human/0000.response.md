*Explanation*: After removing the edge 1-3, the tree splits into two components: one with 2 vertices (1, 2) and another with 3 vertices (3, 4, 5). The smallest component has 2 vertices, so the answer is 2.

**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Removing any edge will result in two components, each with 1 vertex. Thus, the answer is 1.

*Explanation*: Removing the edge 1-2 results in two components: one with 1 vertex (3, 6) and another with 3 vertices (1, 2, 4, 5). The smallest component has 1 vertex, so the answer is 1.

# Test 4

**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Removing the edge 1-2 or 1-3 will result in two components: one with 1 vertex and another with 2 vertices. The smallest component has 1 vertex, but since we are looking for the minimum size of the largest component, the answer is 2.
