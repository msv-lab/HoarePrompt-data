# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [3, 2, 8], and the median is 3. This is the minimum number of operations required.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. After two operations (one on the third element and one on the fourth), the array becomes [7, 3, 4, 2], and the median is 3.5. This is the minimum number of operations required.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [1000000001], and the median is 1000000001. This is the minimum number of operations required.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. After three operations (one on the fourth element and two on the first elements), the array becomes [6, 6, 6, 6, 5], and the median is 6. This is the minimum number of operations required.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. After two operations (one on the first element and one on the third), the array becomes [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4], and the median is 3. This is the minimum number of operations required.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1.5. After two operations (one on the first element and one on the second), the array becomes [2, 3], and the median is 2.5. This is the minimum number of operations required.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. After three operations (one on the first element, one on the second, and one on either), the array becomes [2, 2], and the median is 2. This is the minimum number of operations required.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. No operations are needed because the median is already maximized.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the median of [1, 2, 3] is 2. No operations are needed. For the second test case, the median of [1, 1, 1, 1] is 1. After one operation on any element, the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2], and the median is 1.5. This is the minimum number of operations required.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
7
5 5 5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
6
0
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the median of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3. After two operations (one on the first and one on the second), the array becomes [2, 3, 3, 4, 5], and the median is 3.5. This is the minimum number of operations required. For the second test case, the median of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is 1. After six operations (one on each element), the array becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], and the median is 2. This is the minimum number of operations required. For the third test case, the median of [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. No operations are needed because the median is already maximized.
