**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: In this basic test case, the tree is a simple path with three nodes. Ron starts with the stone at node 3. Since there is only one round, Ron will move the stone to node 2, and then Hermione will have no valid move, making Ron the winner.

```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: In this case, the tree is a straight path with five nodes. Hermione wins because Ron will always be forced to move the stone towards the end of the path, leaving Hermione with the last possible move.

```
**Explanation**: Here, the tree is a simple path with four nodes. Ron starts with the stone at node 2. He can move the stone to node 1, and then Hermione will have no valid move, making Ron the winner.

**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: This is a degenerate case where the tree is a single edge with two nodes. Ron starts with the stone at node 2. He can move the stone to node 1, and then Hermione will have no valid move, making Ron the winner.

**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: In this extreme case, the tree is a straight path with one million nodes. Hermione wins because Ron will always be forced to move the stone towards the ends of the path, leaving Hermione with the last possible move.
