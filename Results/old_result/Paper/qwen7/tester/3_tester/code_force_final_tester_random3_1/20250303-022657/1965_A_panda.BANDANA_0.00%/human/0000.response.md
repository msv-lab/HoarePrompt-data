To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all piles have the same number of stones.
**Input**:
```
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=3 on her first turn, removing all stones from each pile, thus winning the game.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when one pile has fewer stones than others.
**Input**:
```
2
1 7
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn, leaving Bob with a pile of 6 stones. Bob can then choose k=6, removing all stones and winning the game.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the piles have varying numbers of stones.
**Input**:
```
7
1 3 9 7 4 2 100
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, reducing the piles to 0, 2, 8, 6, 3, 1, 99. Bob cannot make a move after Alice's turn, so Alice wins.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all piles have different numbers of stones.
**Input**:
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, reducing the piles to 0, 1, 2. Bob cannot make a move after Alice's turn, so Alice wins.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the piles have a mix of small and large numbers of stones.
**Input**:
```
6
2 1 3 4 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, reducing the piles to 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3. Bob cannot make a move after Alice's turn, so Alice wins.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large number of piles with a single stone each.
**Input**:
```
8
5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn, leaving Bob with piles of 4, 6, 1, 8, 5, 2, 2, 1. Bob can then choose k=1, removing all stones and winning the game.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a single pile with a very large number of stones.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, reducing the pile to 999999999. Bob cannot make a move after Alice's turn, so Alice wins.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a single pile with exactly one stone.
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, removing the last stone and winning the game.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles multiple piles with a single stone each.
**Input**:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, removing all stones from each pile, thus winning the game.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an empty input (though not specified in the problem, it's good to check).
**Input**:
```
0
```
**Output**:
```
(No output)
```
**Explanation**: Since there are no test cases, there should be no output.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
