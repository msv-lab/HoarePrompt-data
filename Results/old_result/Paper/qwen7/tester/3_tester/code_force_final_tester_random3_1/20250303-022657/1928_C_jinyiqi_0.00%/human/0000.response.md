# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Since \( k \) must be greater than 1, there are no valid \( k \) values when \( x = 1 \).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: When \( n = 2 \), the only possible \( k \) value is 2, but since \( x = 1 \), there is no valid \( k \).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only valid \( k \) value is 2, as the sequence would be 1, 2, 1, 2, ...

```
1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only valid \( k \) value is 4, as the sequence would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, ...

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Since \( x = 1 \), the only possible \( k \) value is 2, but the sequence would be 1, 2, 1, 2, ..., which does not match \( x = 1 \).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
9 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is no valid \( k \) such that the sequence matches \( x = 5 \).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Valid \( k \) values are 4 and 8, as the sequences would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, ... and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, ...

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
11 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only valid \( k \) value is 10, as the sequence would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, ...

# Test 13
