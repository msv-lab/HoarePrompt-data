5 5
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 5 \), the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is 10. The points \((1,1)\), \((1,3)\), \((1,4)\), \((2,1)\), and \((5,5)\) achieve this.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 6 \), the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is 15. The points \((1,4)\), \((1,5)\), \((1,6)\), \((5,2)\), \((5,5)\), and \((6,1)\) achieve this.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2

```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 2

2 1
2 3
3 1
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks if the function can handle multiple test cases correctly. The first test case is for \( n = 2 \) and the second test case is for \( n = 3 \).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1000
1000 1
1000 1000
```
*Explanation*: For \( n = 1000 \), the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is 1999. The points \((1,1)\), \((1,1000)\), \((1000,1)\), and \((1000,1000)\) achieve this.
