# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 7 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and the second every 7 minutes. After 7 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4 10
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 3 minutes, and the second every 4 minutes. After 12 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 7 (since the least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 8 56
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 7 minutes, and the second every 8 minutes. After 56 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 17 (since the least common multiple of 7 and 8 is 56).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6 78123459896
```
**Output**: 
```
28645268630
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 5 minutes, and the second every 6 minutes. After 78123459896 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 28645268630 (since the least common multiple of 5 and 6 is 30, and the number of fireworks visible is calculated based on the given formula).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: Both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 2 minutes. After 1 minute, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 4 (since the least common multiple of 1 and 1 is 1, and considering the visibility period).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
*Explanation*: Both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 1000000000000000001 minutes. After 1000000000000000000 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 2000000000000000002 (since the least common multiple of 1 and 1 is 1, and considering the visibility period).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1 2 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, the first installation launches fireworks every minute, and the second every 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 2. In the second test case, the first installation launches fireworks every minute, and the second every 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 15 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 10 minutes, and the second every 15 minutes. After 30 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 3 (since the least common multiple of 10 and 15 is 30).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000001 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 1000000000000000000 minutes, and the second every 1000000000000000001 minutes. After 1000000000000000001 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time 2 (since the least common multiple of 1000000000000000000 and 1000000000000000001 is 10000000000000000010000000000000000001, but we consider the first occurrence).
