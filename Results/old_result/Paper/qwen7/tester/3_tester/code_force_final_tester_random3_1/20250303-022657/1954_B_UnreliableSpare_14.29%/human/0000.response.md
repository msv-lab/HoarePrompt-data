### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
3
2 2 2
5
1 2 1 2 1
1
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
1
-1
3
```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 1**: The array `[2, 2, 2]` cannot be modified to stop being beautiful, so the output is `-1`.
- **Test 2**: The array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` can be made non-beautiful by removing the element at index `5`, making the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`. So, the output is `1`.
- **Test 3**: The array `[1]` cannot be modified to stop being beautiful, so the output is `-1`.
- **Test 4**: The array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` can be made non-beautiful by removing the first three elements, making the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`. So, the output is `3`.

```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 2**: The array `[1, 2]` cannot be modified to stop being beautiful, so the output is `-1`.
- **Test 3**: The array `[1, 1, 2, 2]` can be made non-beautiful by removing the element at index `3`, making the array `[1, 1, 2]`. So, the output is `1`.
- **Test 4**: The array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` can be made non-beautiful by removing the elements at indices `1` and `2`, making the array `[2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`. So, the output is `2`.

```

#### Explanation:
- **Test 11**: The array `[2, 1]` cannot be modified to stop being beautiful, so the output is `-1`.
- **Test 12**: The array `[1, 2, 3]` cannot be modified to stop being beautiful, so the output is `-1`.
- **Test 13**: The array `[3, 1, 2, 3]` cannot be modified to stop being beautiful, so the output is `-1`.
