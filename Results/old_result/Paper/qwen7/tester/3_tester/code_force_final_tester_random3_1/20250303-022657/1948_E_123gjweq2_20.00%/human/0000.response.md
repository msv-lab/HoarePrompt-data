# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with the smallest possible input (n=2, k=3).
**Input**: 
```
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=2 and k=3, the only valid assignment is \(a_1 = 1\) and \(a_2 = 2\). Since \(|1-2| + |1-2| = 2 \leq 3\), the graph forms a single clique. Therefore, the entire graph is a single clique.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a medium-sized input (n=5, k=4).
**Input**: 
```
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: For n=5 and k=4, one valid assignment is \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = 3\), \(a_3 = 5\), \(a_4 = 2\), \(a_5 = 4\). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 3)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), \((3, 5)\), \((4, 5)\) form edges since \(|i-j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq 4\). The graph can be partitioned into two cliques: \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(\{4, 5\}\).

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a larger input (n=8, k=16).
**Input**: 
```
8 16
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=8 and k=16, the simplest assignment is \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = 2\), \(a_3 = 3\), \(a_4 = 4\), \(a_5 = 5\), \(a_6 = 6\), \(a_7 = 7\), \(a_8 = 8\). Since \(k = 16\), all vertices will form a single clique because \(|i-j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq 16\) for all pairs \((i, j)\).

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where \(k\) is large enough to allow all vertices to form a single clique regardless of the permutation.
**Input**: 
```
8 32
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=8 and k=32, the value of \(k\) is so large that all vertices will form a single clique regardless of the permutation of \(a_i\). Hence, the entire graph is a single clique.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where \(k\) is small and forces the graph to be partitioned into multiple cliques.
**Input**: 
```
5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: For n=5 and k=1, the valid assignment is \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = 3\), \(a_3 = 5\), \(a_4 = 2\), \(a_5 = 4\). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 3)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), \((3, 5)\), \((4, 5)\) form edges since \(|i-j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq 1\). The graph can be partitioned into two cliques: \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(\{4, 5\}\).

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where \(n\) is at its maximum and \(k\) is just enough to allow a specific partitioning.
**Input**: 
```
40 80
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 39 40
1
1 1 1 ... 1 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=40 and k=80, the value of \(k\) is large enough to allow all vertices to form a single clique regardless of the permutation of \(a_i\). Hence, the entire graph is a single clique.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where \(n\) is at its maximum and \(k\) is small enough to force a specific partitioning.
**Input**: 
```
40 1
```
**Explanation**: For n=40 and k=1, the valid assignment is a permutation of numbers from 1 to 40. The graph will be partitioned into multiple cliques based on the specific permutation. One possible solution is to alternate between two groups, e.g., \(\{1, 3, 5, ..., 39\}\) and \(\{2, 4, 6, ..., 40\}\).

**Input**: 
```
40 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 5 7 ... 39 2 4 6 ... 40
20
1 1 1 ... 1 2 2 2 ... 2
```
**Explanation**: For n=40 and k=1, the valid assignment is \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = 3\), \(a_3 = 5\), ..., \(a_{39} = 39\), \(a_{40} = 2\). The graph can be partitioned into 20 cliques: \(\{1, 3, 5, ..., 39\}\) and \(\{2, 4, 6, ..., 40\}\).
