To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Hereâ€™s how we can structure the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Alice Wins by Capturing Bob's Chip
- **Objective**: Verify that Alice can win by capturing Bob's chip.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Alice
```
- **Explanation**: Alice starts at (2, 2) and Bob at (5, 3). Alice can move diagonally down-right to capture Bob.

#### Test Case 2: Bob Wins by Capturing Alice's Chip
- **Objective**: Verify that Bob can win by capturing Alice's chip.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Bob
```
- **Explanation**: Alice starts at (2, 1) and Bob at (4, 1). Bob can move up to capture Alice.

#### Test Case 3: Draw when Alice is in Last Row and Bob is in First Row
- **Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw when Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Draw
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 3) and Bob is at (1, 1). Alice cannot move further down, and Bob cannot move up.

#### Test Case 4: Draw when Both Players are Blocked
- **Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw when both players are blocked.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
5 5 1 4 5 2
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Draw
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 4) and Bob is at (5, 2). Alice cannot move further down, and Bob cannot move up.

#### Test Case 5: Draw when Alice and Bob are Far Apart
- **Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw when Alice and Bob are far apart and cannot capture each other.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Draw
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 6) and Bob is at (10, 8). They are too far apart to capture each other.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test Case 6: Alice Starts at Bottom Left Corner
- **Objective**: Verify that Alice cannot win if she starts at the bottom left corner and Bob is in the upper half.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 1 1 2 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Alice
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 1) and Bob is at (2, 1). Alice cannot move down, and Bob can only move up to capture Alice.

#### Test Case 7: Bob Starts at Top Left Corner
- **Objective**: Verify that Bob cannot win if he starts at the top left corner and Alice is in the lower half.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 10 1 1 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Bob
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is at (10, 1) and Bob is at (1, 1). Alice can move down to capture Bob.

#### Test Case 8: Alice and Bob Start in Diagonal Positions
- **Objective**: Verify that Alice can win if she starts diagonally below Bob.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 9 1 8 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Alice
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is at (9, 1) and Bob is at (8, 1). Alice can move down-right to capture Bob.

#### Test Case 9: Bob and Alice Start in Diagonal Positions
- **Objective**: Verify that Bob can win if he starts diagonally above Alice.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 8 1 10 2
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Bob
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is at (8, 1) and Bob is at (10, 2). Bob can move up-left to capture Alice.

#### Test Case 10: Alice and Bob Start in Adjacent Columns
- **Objective**: Verify that Alice can win if she starts in an adjacent column to Bob.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 1 3 4 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Alice
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 3) and Bob is at (4, 1). Alice can move down-right to capture Bob.

#### Test Case 11: Bob and Alice Start in Adjacent Columns
- **Objective**: Verify that Bob can win if he starts in an adjacent column to Alice.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 3 1 1 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Bob
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is at (3, 1) and Bob is at (1, 1). Bob can move up-left to capture Alice.
