To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the simplest case where all piles have the same number of stones.
**Input**:
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 3\) on her first turn, removing all stones from each pile, thus winning the game.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify a case where one pile has fewer stones than others.
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 7
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, leaving Bob to choose \(k = 6\) on his turn, thus winning the game.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify a case with multiple piles having different numbers of stones.
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 3 9 7 4 2 100
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, reducing the piles to \(0, 2, 8, 6, 3, 1, 99\). Then she can continue to reduce the piles until Bob is left with no valid moves.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify a case with small piles and large piles.
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, reducing the piles to \(0, 1, 2\). She can then choose \(k = 1\) again, reducing the piles to \(0, 0, 1\), and finally \(0, 0, 0\), thus winning the game.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify a case with large piles and small piles.
**Input**:
```
1
6
2 1 3 4 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, reducing the piles to \(1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3\). She can then continue to reduce the piles until Bob is left with no valid moves.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify a case with a very large number of stones in one pile.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, reducing the pile to \(0\), thus winning the game.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify a case with a single pile and a very large number of stones.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, reducing the pile to \(0\), thus winning the game.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify a case with multiple piles, all having a single stone.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, removing all stones from each pile, thus winning the game.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify a case with an odd number of piles, all having a single stone.
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, removing all stones from each pile, thus winning the game.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify a case with an even number of piles, all having a single stone.
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, removing all stones from each pile, thus winning the game.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution handles both basic and edge cases effectively.
