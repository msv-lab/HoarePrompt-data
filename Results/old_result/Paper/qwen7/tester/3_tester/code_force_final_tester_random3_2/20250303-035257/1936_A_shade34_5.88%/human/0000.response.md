Given the problem description, we need to create test cases for an interactive problem where we need to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small, simple permutation.

**Input**:
```
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
<

? 1 1 2 3
=

? 1 2 0 3
>
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**: The hidden permutation is likely `[0, 3, 1, 2]`. The queries confirm the relationships and the final answer is correct.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a larger permutation.

**Input**:
```
8
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
>

? 1 1 2 3
=

? 1 2 0 3
<
! 7 5
```
**Explanation**: The hidden permutation is likely `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. The queries confirm the relationships and the final answer is correct.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a permutation with a single element.

**Input**:
```
1
```
**Output**:
```
! 0 0
```
**Explanation**: Since the permutation has only one element, the maximum XOR is trivially zero, and any pair of the same index will satisfy the condition.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a permutation with duplicate elements.

**Input**:
```
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 3
=
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, and since all elements are unique, the maximum XOR is 3, which occurs between any two different elements.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a permutation with all elements being the same.

**Input**:
```
4
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
! 0 0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are the same, so the maximum XOR is zero, and any pair of the same index will satisfy the condition.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a permutation with a large number of elements.

**Input**:
```
10000
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 3
>

? 1 1 2 3
=

? 1 2 0 3
<
! 9999 9998
```
**Explanation**: The hidden permutation is likely a random permutation of `[0, 1, 2, ..., 9999]`. The queries confirm the relationships and the final answer is correct.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that the number of queries does not exceed \(3n\) for each test case.
- The test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
