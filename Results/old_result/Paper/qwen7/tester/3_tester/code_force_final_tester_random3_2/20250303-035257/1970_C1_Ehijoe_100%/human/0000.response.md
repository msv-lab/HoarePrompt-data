# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on one of them.
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 1 is connected to Node 2 and Node 3. Since Node 3 is a leaf and the stone is placed there, Ron can move the stone to Node 2 and win the round.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the other leaf.
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 1 is connected to Node 2 and Node 3. Since Node 1 is a leaf and the stone is placed there, Hermione can move the stone to Node 2 and win the round.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the non-leaf node.
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 1 is connected to Node 2 and Node 3. Since Node 2 is not a leaf and the stone is placed there, Ron can move the stone to Node 3 and win the round.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the non-leaf node, but the non-leaf node has only one active neighbor.
**Input**: 
```
4 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, and 4. Since Node 1 is not a leaf and the stone is placed there, Ron can move the stone to Node 2. However, Node 2 has only one active neighbor (Node 1), so Hermione can move the stone to Node 3 and win the round.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the non-leaf node, but the non-leaf node has more than one active neighbor.
**Input**: 
```
4 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, and 4. Since Node 1 is not a leaf and the stone is placed there, Ron can move the stone to Node 2 or Node 3. If Hermione moves the stone to Node 4, Ron can then move the stone back to Node 1 and win the round.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the non-leaf node, but the non-leaf node has only one active neighbor, and the stone is moved back and forth between the non-leaf node and its single neighbor.
**Input**: 
```
4 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, and 4. Since Node 1 is not a leaf and the stone is placed there, Ron can move the stone to Node 2. Hermione can then move the stone back to Node 1 and win the round.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the non-leaf node, but the non-leaf node has more than one active neighbor, and the stone is moved back and forth between the non-leaf node and its neighbors.
**Input**: 
```
4 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, and 4. Since Node 1 is not a leaf and the stone is placed there, Ron can move the stone to Node 2 or Node 3. If Hermione moves the stone to Node 4, Ron can then move the stone back to Node 1 and win the round.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the non-leaf node, but the non-leaf node has more than one active neighbor, and the stone is moved back and forth multiple times.
**Input**: 
```
4 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, and 4. Since Node 1 is not a leaf and the stone is placed there, Ron can move the stone to Node 2 or Node 3. If Hermione moves the stone to Node 4, Ron can then move the stone back to Node 1 and win the round.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the non-leaf node, but the non-leaf node has more than one active neighbor, and the stone is moved back and forth multiple times, ensuring Hermione cannot force a win.
**Input**: 
```
4 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, and 4. Since Node 1 is not a leaf and the stone is placed there, Ron can move the stone to Node 2 or Node 3. If Hermione moves the stone to Node 4, Ron can then move the stone back to Node 1 and win the round.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone is placed on the non-leaf node, but the non-leaf node has more than one active neighbor, and the stone is moved back and forth multiple times, ensuring Ron cannot force a win.
**Input**:
