### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small array where all elements are unique.
**Input**:
```
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
12 0
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of any subarray will always be 4, but since we cannot change the entire array to 4 within the given constraints, the sum remains unchanged.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small array where all elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
3 0
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of any subarray will be 0, and setting all elements to 0 does not increase the sum.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small array where some elements are the same and others are different.
**Input**:
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
6 0
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of any subarray will be 0, and setting all elements to 0 does not increase the sum.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small array where the elements are in ascending order.
**Input**:
```
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3 0
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of any subarray will be 3, but since we cannot change the entire array to 3 within the given constraints, the sum remains unchanged.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small array where the elements are in descending order.
**Input**:
```
3
2 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
3 0
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of any subarray will be 3, but since we cannot change the entire array to 3 within the given constraints, the sum remains unchanged.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum allowed operations limit.
**Input**:
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**:
```
171 18
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the entire array is 0, and setting all elements to 0 is the optimal solution. This test checks if the function can handle the maximum number of operations.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with repeated elements.
**Input**:
```
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
4 0
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of any subarray will be 0, and setting all elements to 0 does not increase the sum.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a single element.
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the single element is 1, and setting the element to 1 increases the sum from 0 to 1.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with large values.
**Input**:
```
3
10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
30000000 0
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of any subarray will be 0, and setting all elements to 0 does not increase the sum.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a mix of large and small values.
**Input**:
```
4
10000000 1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
10000006 1
3 4
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the subarray [2, 3] is 0, and setting these elements to 0 increases the sum from 10000006 to 10000006.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
