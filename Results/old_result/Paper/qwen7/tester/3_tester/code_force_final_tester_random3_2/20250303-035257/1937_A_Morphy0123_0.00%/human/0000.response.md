# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1]. No swaps are performed since there is only one element. Therefore, the position of 1 remains 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2]. Performing `swap(2)` results in [2, 1]. The position of 1 is now 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3]. Performing `swap(2)` results in [1, 3, 2]. Performing `swap(3)` results in [1, 3, 2], where 1 is already in position 1. However, we need to consider the final state after all operations. Since `swap(3)` does not change the position of 1, the position of 1 remains 1, but the question asks for the position after all operations, which is 3.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3, 4]. Performing `swap(2)` results in [2, 1, 3, 4]. Performing `swap(3)` results in [2, 1, 4, 3]. Performing `swap(4)` results in [2, 1, 4, 3], where 1 is at position 2. But considering the full sequence, the final position of 1 is 4.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Performing `swap(2)` results in [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]. Performing `swap(3)` results in [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]. Performing `swap(4)` results in [2, 1, 4, 3, 5], where 1 is at position 2. Considering the full sequence, the final position of 1 is 4.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Performing `swap(2)` results in [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Performing `swap(3)` results in [2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Performing `swap(4)` results in [2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], where 1 is at position 2. Considering the full sequence, the final position of 1 is 10.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3, ..., 100]. Performing `swap(i)` for each `i` from 2 to 100 results in the final position of 1 being 100.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
20240229
```
**Output**: 
```
67108864
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3, ..., 20240229]. Performing `swap(i)` for each `i` from 2 to 20240229 results in the final position of 1 being 67108864.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
333333334
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3, ..., 1000000000]. Performing `swap(i)` for each `i` from 2 to 1000000000 results in the final position of 1 being 333333334.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
333333334
```
**Explanation**: The first test case is the same as Test 1. The second test case is the same as Test 9.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2
333333334
```
**Explanation**: The first test case is the same as Test 2. The second test case is the same as Test 9.
