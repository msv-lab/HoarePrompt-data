# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
4

**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The array is [1, 2, ..., 1000000000]. Performing the operations up to `swap(1000000000)` results in the array where 1 is at position 4.

```
2
2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
3
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, the array is [1, 2]. Performing `swap(2)` results in [2, 1], where 1 is at position 2. For the second test case, the array is [1, 2, 3]. Performing `swap(2)` and `swap(3)` results in [3, 1, 2], where 1 is at position 2.
