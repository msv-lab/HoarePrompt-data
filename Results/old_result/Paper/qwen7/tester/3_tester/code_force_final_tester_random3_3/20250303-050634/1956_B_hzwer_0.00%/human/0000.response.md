# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: This is the basic scenario described in the example. You have two 1s, one 2, and one 3. Nene will play optimally to minimize your score. The optimal sequence of moves leads to you scoring 1 point.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8
7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Nene will play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The optimal sequence of moves leads to you scoring 2 points.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8
7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Similar to the first test case but with different card distributions. The optimal sequence of moves leads to you scoring 1 point.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: You have one of each card. Nene will play optimally to prevent you from scoring any points. The optimal sequence of moves leads to you scoring 0 points.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Only one card exists, and you have it. Nene will play optimally to prevent you from scoring any points. The optimal sequence of moves leads to you scoring 0 points.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
*Explanation*: In the first sub-case, you have the only card, and Nene has none. The optimal sequence of moves leads to you scoring 0 points. In the second sub-case, you have two 1s, and Nene has none. The optimal sequence of moves leads to you scoring 1 point.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 2
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: Both players have the same cards but in different orders. Nene will play optimally to prevent either player from scoring any points. The optimal sequence of moves leads to both players scoring 0 points.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```

3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: Both players have the same cards but in different orders. Nene will play optimally to prevent either player from scoring any points. The optimal sequence of moves leads to both players scoring 0 points.
