# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a simple, evenly spaced sequence of prepared problems, and a small number of models and functions.

**Input**:
```
1
5 1 1
1 2 3 4 5
10
5
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The original imbalance is 1 (between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc.). By adding a problem with complexity 10, the new sequence becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10], and the maximum gap is 9 (between 5 and 10).

# Test 2
**Objective**: Check the scenario where the new problem can be placed between two existing problems to minimize the imbalance.

**Input**:
```
1
5 1 1
1 2 3 4 5
3
5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The original imbalance is 1. By adding a problem with complexity 3, the new sequence becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and the maximum gap is 2 (between 2 and 3, 3 and 4, etc.).

# Test 3
**Objective**: Test with multiple models and functions to see if the function correctly identifies the best combination to minimize the imbalance.

**Input**:
```
1
5 2 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 10
1 10
```
