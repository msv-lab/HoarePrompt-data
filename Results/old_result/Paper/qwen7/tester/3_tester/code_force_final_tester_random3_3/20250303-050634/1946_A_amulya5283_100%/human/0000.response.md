# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. After applying one operation to the first element, the array becomes [3, 2, 8], and the median is 3, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. After applying two operations, one to the first element and one to the third element, the array becomes [8, 3, 4, 1], and the median is 3.5, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. After applying one operation to the only element, the array remains [1000000000], and the median is still 1000000000, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. After applying three operations, one to each of the elements at indices 1, 2, and 3, the array becomes [6, 6, 6, 4, 5], and the median is 6, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. After applying two operations, one to the first element and one to the third element, the array becomes [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4], and the median is 3, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1.5. After applying two operations, one to the first element and one to the second element, the array becomes [2, 3], and the median is 2.5, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. After applying three operations, one to each of the elements, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median is 2, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. Since all elements are already equal to the median, no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
1
1
2
2 1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
1
```
*Explanation*: 
- For the first test case, the array [1] has a median of 1, and no operations are needed.
- For the second test case, the array [2, 1] has a median of 1.5. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [3, 1], and the median is 2, which is greater than the original median.
- For the third test case, the array [1, 2, 3] has a median of 2. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [2, 2, 3], and the median is 2, which is the same as the original median but still valid since we aim to make it strictly greater.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
1
```
*Explanation*: 
- For the first test case, the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] has a median of 3, and no operations are needed.
- For the second test case, the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] has a median of 3.5. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and the median is 3.5, which is the same as the original median but still valid.
- For the third test case, the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] has a median of 4. After one operation on the first element, the array becomes [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and the median is 4, which is the same as the original median but still valid.
