# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so no polygons can be formed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Two sticks of the same length are not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Four sticks of length 3 can form a square, and the remaining two sticks of length 2 are not enough to form another polygon.

# Test 4

```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Eight sticks can form two polygons: one with side length 2 (using four sticks) and one with side length 4 (using four sticks).

# Test 5

```
**Output**: 
```

0
```
**Explanation**: In the first subcase, there is only one stick, so no polygons can be formed. In the second subcase, the two sticks are not enough to form a polygon.

**Explanation**: The first subcase has only one stick, so no polygons can be formed. The second subcase has two sticks of the same length, which are not enough to form a polygon. The third subcase has six sticks, where four sticks of length 3 can form a square. The fourth subcase has ten sticks of the same length, where five sticks can form a pentagon.

# Test 8

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: All ten sticks are of the same length, so they can all be used to form ten polygons with one side each.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have different lengths, and none of them can form a polygon when combined.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Three sticks of the same length can form one polygon with three sides.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```

2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Two sticks of length 2 and one stick of length 3 cannot form any polygons together.
