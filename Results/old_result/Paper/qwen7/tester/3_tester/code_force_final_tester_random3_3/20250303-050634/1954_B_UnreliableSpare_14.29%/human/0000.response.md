To thoroughly test the solution for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the comprehensive test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify an array where all elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is already beautiful and cannot be modified to stop being beautiful.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify an array with alternating elements.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing one element (e.g., the second element) will make the array [1, 1, 2, 1] which is not beautiful.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify an array with a single element.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is already beautiful and cannot be modified to stop being beautiful.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify an array with repeated elements but not all the same.
**Input**:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Removing the first three elements will result in [5, 3, 3, 3], which is not beautiful.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify an empty array.
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: An empty array is considered beautiful, and removing any element would make it invalid.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify a very large array with a pattern that can be reduced.
**Input**:
```
1
300000
1 2 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
150000
```
**Explanation**: Removing half of the elements (150000 elements) will break the pattern, making the array not beautiful.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify a very large array with a complex pattern.
**Input**:
```
1
300000
3 3 3 5 3 3 3 5 3 3 3 5 ... 3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: Removing one-third of the elements (100000 elements) will break the pattern, making the array not beautiful.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify a very large array with a simple repeating pattern.
**Input**:
```
1
300000
1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is already beautiful and cannot be modified to stop being beautiful.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify a very large array with a pattern that can be broken by removing a few elements.
**Input**:
```
1
300000
2 2 2 3 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 3 ... 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 3 2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: Removing one-fourth of the elements (100000 elements) will break the pattern, making the array not beautiful.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
