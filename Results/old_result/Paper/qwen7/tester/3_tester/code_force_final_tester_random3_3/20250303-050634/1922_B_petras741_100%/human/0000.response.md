# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle because all sticks have the same length. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 7 is calculated using the combination formula \( C(n, 3) = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \), which equals 35.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths 3, 2, 1, and 3. The valid combinations are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 3, 2). Note that (3, 2, 3) is the same as (3, 3, 2) in terms of forming a triangle.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths 2, 4, and 8. No combination of these sticks can form a triangle because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side, and here no such combination exists.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so it is impossible to form a triangle with exactly 3 sticks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, there are 6 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\). The valid combinations are (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 8), (1, 2, 16), (1, 2, 32), (1, 4, 8), (1, 4, 16), (1, 4, 32), (1, 8, 16), (1, 8, 32), (1, 16, 32), (2, 4, 8), (2, 4, 16), (2, 4, 32), (2, 8, 16), (2, 8, 32), (2, 16, 32), (4, 8, 16), (4, 8, 32), (4, 16, 32), (8, 16, 32). This gives us 20 valid combinations.

For the second test case, there are 3 sticks with lengths 2, 4, and 8. No combination of these sticks can form a triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
56
```
**Explanation**: There are 8 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7\). The number of valid combinations can be calculated similarly to the previous test case, resulting in 56 valid combinations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: There are 10 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8, 2^9\). The number of valid combinations is calculated to be 120.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths 1, 1, and 1. The only valid combination is (1, 1, 1).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: There are 5 sticks with lengths 1, 2, 2, 2, and 2. The valid combinations are (1, 2, 2), (1, 2, 2), (1, 2, 2), and (1, 2, 2), but since we count unique sets, it results in 4 valid combinations.
