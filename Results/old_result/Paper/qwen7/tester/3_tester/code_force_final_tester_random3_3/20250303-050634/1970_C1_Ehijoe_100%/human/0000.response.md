# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3 1

```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1 and 2. Ron starts with the stone on Node 3, which is a leaf. He can move the stone to Node 1 or Node 2. Hermione then moves the stone to the other leaf. Ron cannot make any more moves, so Hermione wins. However, since Ron makes the first move and there is only one round, Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Input**:

```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as a straight line from Node 1 to Node 5. Ron starts with the stone on Node 5. He can move the stone to Node 4. Hermione then moves the stone to Node 3. Ron can move the stone to Node 2. Hermione then moves the stone to Node 1. Ron cannot make any more moves, so Hermione wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4 1

```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 2 is connected to Nodes 1 and 3, and Node 3 is connected to Node 4. Ron starts with the stone on Node 2. He can move the stone to Node 1 or Node 3. If he moves to Node 1, Hermione can move the stone to Node 2, and Ron cannot make any more moves. If he moves to Node 3, Hermione can move the stone to Node 4, and Ron cannot make any more moves. Therefore, Ron wins by making the first move.

**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as a straight line from Node 1 to Node 6. Ron starts with the stone on Node 3. He can move the stone to Node 2 or Node 4. If he moves to Node 2, Hermione can move the stone to Node 1, and Ron cannot make any more moves. If he moves to Node 4, Hermione can move the stone to Node 5, and Ron cannot make any more moves. Therefore, Hermione wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
4 1

4
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is structured as follows: Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, and 3. Ron starts with the stone on Node 4. He can move the stone to Node 1, Node 2, or Node 3. If he moves to Node 1, Hermione can move the stone to Node 2, and Ron can move the stone back to Node 1. Hermione cannot make any more moves, so Ron wins. Similar logic applies if Ron moves to Node 2 or Node 3.

# Test 6

**Explanation**: The tree is structured as a straight line from Node 1 to Node 5. Ron starts with the stone on Node 1. He can move the stone to Node 2. Hermione then moves the stone to Node 3. Ron can move the stone to Node 4. Hermione then moves the stone to Node 5. Ron cannot make any more moves, so Hermione wins. However, since Ron makes the first move and there is only one round, Ron wins.
