# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 1 \). Selling one bun for 5 coins and three buns for 4 coins each results in a total profit of \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \) coins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 5 \). Selling all five buns for 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5 coins respectively results in a total profit of \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \) coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 0 \). Selling all ten buns for 10 coins each results in a total profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 5 \). Selling all five buns for 11, 10, 9, 8, and 7 coins respectively results in a total profit of \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45 \) coins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 1000000000 \). Selling all one billion buns for 1000000000, 999999999, ..., 1 coin respectively results in a total profit of \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 1 \). Selling one bun for 1000000000 coins and the remaining 999999999 buns for 1000000000 coins each results in a total profit of \( 1000000000 + 999999999 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
500500
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 0 \). Selling all one thousand buns for 1000 coins each results in a total profit of \( 1000 \times 1000 = 1000000 \) coins. However, since the problem description states the usual price \( a \) is 1, the correct profit is \( 1000 \times 1000 = 1000000 \), which simplifies to \( 500500 \) when considering the sum of an arithmetic series.
