To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works when all chips are already in a single block.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works when all chips are in a single block but are not at the start.
**Input**:
```
1
8
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works when there is only one chip.
**Input**:
```
1
4
0 1 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works when there are multiple chips but no free cells between them.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works when there are multiple chips and some free cells between them.
**Input**:
```
1
8
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum number of cells (2 cells).
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of cells (50 cells).
**Input**:
```
1
50
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where all cells are free except one chip.
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 1 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where all cells are free except one chip at the end.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where all cells are free except one chip at the beginning.
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where there are multiple chips and the last chip is at the end.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where there are multiple chips and the last chip is in the middle.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where there are multiple chips and the last chip is at the beginning.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where there are multiple chips and the last chip is in the middle with many free cells.
**Input**:
```
1
10
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
5
```

#### Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where there are multiple chips and the last chip is at the end with many free cells.
**Input**:
```
1
10
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
5
```

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
