# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make the amount of water the same (itself).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container with zero water, so it is trivially possible to make the amount of water the same (zero).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: There are two containers with different amounts of water (1 and 3), making it impossible to make them equal using the given operation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 15, and there are 5 containers, so each container should have 3 units of water. The given distribution can be adjusted to achieve this.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 6, and there are 3 containers, so each container should have 2 units of water. The given distribution can be adjusted to achieve this.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 28, and there are 7 containers, so each container should have 4 units of water. However, the initial distribution cannot be adjusted to achieve this due to the presence of a zero unit container.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 28, and there are 7 containers, so each container should have 4 units of water. However, the initial distribution cannot be adjusted to achieve this due to the uneven distribution of water among the containers.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There are 200,000 containers, each initially having 0 units of water. Since the sum of water is divisible by the number of containers, it is possible to make all containers have 0 units of water.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There are 200,000 containers, each initially having 1,000,000,000 units of water. Since the sum of water is divisible by the number of containers, it is possible to make all containers have 1,000,000,000 units of water.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 199999 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 200,000 * (200,000 + 1) / 2 = 200,000,000,000, which is divisible by 200,000. However, the initial distribution cannot be adjusted to make all containers have the same amount of water due to the large difference between the smallest and largest values.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There are 2 containers, each initially having 0 units of water. Since the sum of water is divisible by the number of containers, it is possible to make all containers have 0 units of water.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: There are 2 containers with different amounts of water (1 and 0), making it impossible to make them equal using the given operation.
