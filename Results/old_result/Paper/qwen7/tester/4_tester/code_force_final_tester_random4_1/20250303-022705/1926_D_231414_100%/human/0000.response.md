# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: In this basic test case, the numbers 1, 4, and 3 have overlapping bits when considering their 31 least significant bits. Therefore, each number must be placed in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The numbers 0 and \(2^{31}-1\) (which is 2147483647) have different bits at every position. Hence, they can be placed in the same group.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where multiple numbers are involved, and the minimum number of groups required is 3. The numbers provided may share some bit positions but not all, necessitating multiple groups.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1335890506 811593141 1128223362
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case involves three numbers. By examining their binary representations, it can be determined that two groups are sufficient to meet the requirement.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case involves four numbers. The binary representations of these numbers show that only two groups are needed.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
61545621 2085938026 1269342732 1430258575
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case involves four numbers. The binary representations indicate that three groups are necessary.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case includes two zeros and two maximum 31-bit numbers. Two groups are sufficient because the zeros and the maximum values do not share the same bits.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case includes two zeros and one maximum 31-bit number. Two groups are needed because the zeros and the maximum value do not share the same bits.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case involves eight numbers, including repeated values. The minimum number of groups required is 4 because certain pairs of numbers share the same bits, necessitating separate groups.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
