# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
10011
1110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first 2 characters of '10011' (i.e., '10') form a subsequence of '1110'. The next character '0' does not form a subsequence, so the answer is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
100
110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first 2 characters of '100' (i.e., '10') form a subsequence of '110'. The next character '0' does not form a subsequence, so the answer is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3
1
111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The first character of '1' (i.e., '1') forms a subsequence of '111'. The next character does not exist, so the answer is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1011
1111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The first character of '1011' (i.e., '1') forms a subsequence of '1111'. The next character '0' does not form a subsequence, so the answer is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
100
11010
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The first 3 characters of '100' (i.e., '100') form a subsequence of '11010'. The next character '0' does not form a subsequence, so the answer is 3.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
100
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The string '100' does not have any prefix that forms a subsequence of '0', so the answer is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
1
1
1 1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the entire string '1' forms a subsequence of '1'. For the second test case, the string '1' does not form a subsequence of '0', so the answer is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2
01
01
2 2
10
01
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
```
*Explanation*: For both test cases, the prefixes of '01' and '10' match the corresponding substrings in '01' and '01', respectively. The first test case matches fully, while the second test case matches partially.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
5 10
10011
1111100001
5 10
10011
0000011110
```
**Output**: 
```
5
4
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the entire string '10011' forms a subsequence of '1111100001'. For the second test case, the first 4 characters '1001' form a subsequence of '0000011110', but the full string does not.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
1 10
0
1111111111
1 10
1
0000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the string '0' forms a subsequence of '1111111111'. For the second test case, the string '1' does not form a subsequence of '0000000000', so the answer is 0.

# Test 11

**Output**: 
```
10
5
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, the entire string '1010101010' forms a subsequence of '1010101010'. For the second test case, the first 5 characters '10101' form a subsequence of '0101010101', but the full string does not.
