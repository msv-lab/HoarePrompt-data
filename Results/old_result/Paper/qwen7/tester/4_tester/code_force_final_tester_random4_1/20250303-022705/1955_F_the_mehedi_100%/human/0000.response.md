To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Hereâ€™s a detailed set of test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all counts are zero.
**Input**:
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: If there are no elements in the sequence, Alice cannot win, so Bob wins every time.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all counts are non-zero.
**Input**:
```
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With one of each type of element, the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, so Alice wins initially. If Eve removes one element, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice still wins.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are multiple elements of the same type.
**Input**:
```
2 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With two ones, the initial XOR is non-zero, so Alice wins. If Eve removes one one, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice still wins.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are multiple elements of different types.
**Input**:
```
1 1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With one one, one two, and two threes, the initial XOR is non-zero, so Alice wins. If Eve removes one one, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice still wins.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are many elements of the same type.
**Input**:
```
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 200 ones, the initial XOR is non-zero, so Alice wins. If Eve removes one one, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice still wins.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are many elements of different types.
**Input**:
```
100 100 100 100
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 100 of each type, the initial XOR is non-zero, so Alice wins. Eve can remove one of each type (one one, one two, one three), leaving the remaining sequence with a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice still wins. Removing another set of one of each type will also leave a non-zero XOR, but removing the last one will make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win once.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are many elements of the same type and one of a different type.
**Input**:
```
200 1 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 200 ones and one two, the initial XOR is non-zero, so Alice wins. If Eve removes one one, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice still wins.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are many elements of the same type and one of a different type, but Eve removes the wrong type.
**Input**:
```
200 0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 200 ones and one three, the initial XOR is non-zero, so Alice wins. If Eve removes one three, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice still wins.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are many elements of the same type and one of a different type, but Eve removes the wrong type again.
**Input**:
```
200 0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 200 ones and one four, the initial XOR is non-zero, so Alice wins. If Eve removes one four, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice still wins.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are many elements of the same type and two of a different type.
**Input**:
```
200 2 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 200 ones and two twos, the initial XOR is non-zero, so Alice wins. If Eve removes one one, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice still wins.
