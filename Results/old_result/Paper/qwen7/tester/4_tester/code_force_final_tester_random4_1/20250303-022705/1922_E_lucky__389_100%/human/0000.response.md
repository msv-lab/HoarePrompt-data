# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 0]`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
*Explanation*: The array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The possible increasing subsequences are: the empty subsequence, `[2]`, `[2]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[2, 2]`, `[2, 2, 3]`, `[2, 2, 4]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[2, 2, 3, 4]`, `[2, 2, 4]`, and `[2, 3, 4]`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
*Explanation*: The array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The possible increasing subsequences include the empty subsequence, all single-element subsequences, and various combinations of the elements in increasing order.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: There is no array of length at most 200 that has exactly 1 increasing subsequence because the minimum number of increasing subsequences any array can have is 1 (the empty subsequence).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: It is impossible to construct an array of length at most 200 that has exactly \(10^{18}\) increasing subsequences since the maximum number of increasing subsequences for an array of length 200 is much smaller than \(10^{18}\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 1
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 1]` has exactly 4 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 1, 2]` has exactly 6 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 2]`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 0 1
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 0, 1]` has exactly 9 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 0]`, `[0, 1]`, `[0, 0, 1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 0, 1]`.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
12
```
**Output**: 
```
4
0 0 1 2
```
*Explanation*: The array `[0, 0, 1, 2]` has exactly 12 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[0, 0]`, `[0, 1]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 0, 1]`, `[0, 0, 2]`, `[0, 1, 2]`, and `[0, 0, 1, 2]`.
