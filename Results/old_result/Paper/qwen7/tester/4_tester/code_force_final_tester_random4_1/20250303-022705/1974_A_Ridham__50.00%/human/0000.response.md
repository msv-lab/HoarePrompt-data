To address the given problem, we will create a function that calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. We will then create comprehensive test cases to ensure the function works correctly under various scenarios.

### Function Implementation

```python
def min_screens(x, y):
    # Calculate the total number of cells needed
    total_cells = x + 4 * y
    
    # Calculate the number of full screens needed
    full_screens = total_cells // 15
    
    # Calculate remaining cells after placing full screens
    remaining_cells = total_cells % 15
    
    # If there are any remaining cells, an additional screen is needed
    if remaining_cells > 0:
        return full_screens + 1
    
    return full_screens
```
