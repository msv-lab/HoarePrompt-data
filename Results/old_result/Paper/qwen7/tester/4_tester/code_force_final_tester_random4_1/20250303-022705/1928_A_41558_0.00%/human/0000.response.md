# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 1x1 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, hence no other rectangle can be formed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 2x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which are considered the same when rotated.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 6x3 rectangle can be cut into two 6x1.5 rectangles, but since the side lengths must be integers, it cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 10x10 rectangle can be cut into two 10x5 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 5x20 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 100x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which are considered the same when rotated.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 1x100 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which are considered the same when rotated.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 4x4 rectangle can be cut into four 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form an 8x2 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 5x5 rectangle can be cut into five 5x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x25 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 7x3 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle without violating the integer side length requirement.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 10x5 rectangle can be cut into two 10x2.5 rectangles, but since the side lengths must be integers, it cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle. However, it can be cut into two 5x5 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 10x5 rectangle, which is the same. Therefore, it needs to be checked if there's a way to form a different rectangle, which in this case, is not possible.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 10x100 rectangle can be cut into two 10x50 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 50x10 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 1000x1000 rectangle can be cut into two 1000x500 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 500x2000 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 1x1000 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which are considered the same when rotated.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 1000x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which are considered the same when rotated.
