To address the given problem, we need to implement a comprehensive set of test cases that cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here is a detailed breakdown of the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1: Standard Game with Alice Winning**
   - **Objective**: Verify Alice can win by capturing Bob's chip.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     6 5 2 2 5 3
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

2. **Test Case 2: Standard Game with Bob Winning**
   - **Objective**: Verify Bob can win by capturing Alice's chip.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     4 1 2 1 4 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Bob
     ```

3. **Test Case 3: Standard Game Ending in a Draw**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game ends in a draw when neither player can capture the opponent's chip.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     1 4 1 3 1 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

4. **Test Case 4: Alice and Bob in Different Rows but Same Column**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game logic when Alice and Bob are in different rows but the same column.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     5 5 1 4 5 2
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

5. **Test Case 5: Alice and Bob in Different Columns but Same Row**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game logic when Alice and Bob are in different columns but the same row.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     4 4 1 1 4 4
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

### Edge Test Cases

1. **Test Case 6: Alice in Last Row and Bob in First Row**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game ends in a draw when Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 1 6 10 8
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

2. **Test Case 7: Alice in Last Row and Bob in First Row with Different Columns**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game logic when Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row with different columns.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 1 6 10 7
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

3. **Test Case 8: Alice in First Row and Bob in Last Row**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game ends in a draw when Alice is in the first row and Bob is in the last row.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 9 1 8 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

4. **Test Case 9: Alice in First Row and Bob in Last Row with Different Columns**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game logic when Alice is in the first row and Bob is in the last row with different columns.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 8 1 10 2
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

5. **Test Case 10: Alice and Bob in First and Last Rows Respectively**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game logic when Alice is in the first row and Bob is in the last row.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 1 1 2 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

6. **Test Case 11: Alice and Bob in First and Last Rows Respectively with Different Columns**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game logic when Alice is in the first row and Bob is in the last row with different columns.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 1 3 4 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

7. **Test Case 12: Alice and Bob in First and Last Rows Respectively with Different Rows and Columns**
   - **Objective**: Verify the game logic when Alice is in the first row and Bob is in the last row with different columns.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 3 1 1 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
