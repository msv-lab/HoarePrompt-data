# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make the amount of water the same (itself).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: There is only one container with zero water, so it is trivially possible to make the amount of water the same (zero).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 3
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
YES
```
**Explanation**: For the first sub-case, it is impossible to make both containers have the same amount of water since the difference between them is too large. For the second sub-case, the average amount of water per container is 2, and it is possible to distribute the water evenly.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The total amount of water is 15, and the average is 3. We can pour water to make all containers have 3 units of water.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total amount of water is 28, and the average is 4. However, it is impossible to make all containers have exactly 4 units of water due to the distribution constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total amount of water is 28, and the average is 4. Similar to the previous case, it is impossible to make all containers have exactly 4 units of water.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The total amount of water is 6, and the average is 2. We can pour water to make all containers have 2 units of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water (0), so no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can pour all the water from the first container to other containers to make them all have 1 unit of water.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water (1), so no operations are needed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total amount of water is 55, and the average is 5.5. Since we cannot have half units of water, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water (2), so no operations are needed.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can pour water from the last two containers to the first five containers to make them all have 1.5 units of water.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can pour all the water from the last container to the first nine containers to make them all have 1 unit of water.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water (1), so no operations are needed.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total amount of water is 11, and the average is 1.1. Since we cannot have fractional units of water, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can pour water from the last two containers to the first eight containers to make them all have 1.2 units of water.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can pour water from the last three containers to the first seven containers to make them all have 1.3 units of water.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can pour water from the last four containers to the first six containers to make them all have 1.4 units of water.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
