```
4
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array where some elements are the same and others are different.
**Input**:
```
1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a single-element array.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array where all elements are the same but the length is 1.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

### 2. Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an empty array.
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a large number of elements.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
199999
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a single unique element repeated multiple times.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with two unique elements.
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 2 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a repeating sequence.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 2 3 1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a single unique element followed by another unique element.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a single unique element followed by a sequence of the same element.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a sequence of the same element followed by a single unique element.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a sequence of the same element followed by another sequence of the same element.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a sequence of the same element followed by a sequence of another element.
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 2 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```

#### Test 16
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a sequence of the same element followed by a sequence of another element and then a sequence of the same element again.
**Input**:
```
1
9
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

#### Test 17
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a sequence of the same element followed by a sequence of another element and then a sequence of the same element again, with a single unique element in between.
**Input**:
```
1
9
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

#### Test 18
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a sequence of the same element followed by a sequence of another element and then a sequence of the same element again, with a single unique element at the end.
**Input**:
```
1
9
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

#### Test 19
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a sequence of the same element followed by a sequence of another element and then a sequence of the same element again, with a single unique element at the beginning.
**Input**:
```
1
9
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

#### Test 20
**Objective**: Verify the function handles an array with a sequence of the same element followed by a sequence of another element and then a sequence of the same element again, with a single unique element in the middle.
**Input**:
```
1
9
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
