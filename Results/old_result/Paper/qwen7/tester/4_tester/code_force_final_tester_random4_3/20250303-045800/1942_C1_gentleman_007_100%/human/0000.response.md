To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple polygon where the chosen vertices allow forming exactly 2 triangles.
**Input**:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1, 6, 2, and 5, we can form 2 non-intersecting triangles. For example, triangles (1, 2, 6) and (2, 5, 6).

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices allow forming exactly 6 triangles.
**Input**:
```
3
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With all vertices chosen, we can form 6 non-intersecting triangles. For example, triangles (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7), and (6, 7, 8).

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small polygon where the chosen vertices allow forming exactly 2 triangles.
**Input**:
```
3
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1 and 3, we can form 2 non-intersecting triangles. For example, triangles (1, 2, 3) and (3, 4, 1).

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with a large polygon where no additional vertices can be chosen.
**Input**:
```
3
1000000000 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With only 2 vertices, we can form at most 1 triangle. For example, triangle (1, 2, 3).

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are consecutive.
**Input**:
```
3
6 3 0
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1, 2, and 3, we can form at most 1 triangle. For example, triangle (1, 2, 3).

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are spread out.
**Input**:
```
3
6 3 0
1 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1, 4, and 5, we can form 2 non-intersecting triangles. For example, triangles (1, 2, 4) and (4, 5, 6).

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are all but one vertex.
**Input**:
```
3
5 4 0
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can form at most 1 triangle. For example, triangle (1, 2, 3).

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are all but two vertices.
**Input**:
```
3
5 3 0
1 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1, 2, and 4, we can form at most 1 triangle. For example, triangle (1, 2, 3).

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are all but three vertices.
**Input**:
```
3
5 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1 and 2, we can form at most 1 triangle. For example, triangle (1, 2, 3).

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are all but four vertices.
**Input**:
```
3
5 1 0
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With vertex 1, we can form at most 1 triangle. For example, triangle (1, 2, 3).
