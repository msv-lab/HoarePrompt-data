*Explanation*: After removing the edge 1-3, the tree splits into two components: one with 2 vertices (1, 2) and another with 3 vertices (3, 4, 5). The smallest component has 2 vertices, so the answer is 2.

*Explanation*: After removing four edges, the tree can be split into five components, each with 1 vertex. The smallest component has 1 vertex, so the answer is 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```

1 0
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: For the first set, no edges can be removed, so the entire tree remains as one component with 1 vertex. For the second set, after removing one edge, the tree splits into two components, each with 1 vertex. The smallest component has 1 vertex, so the answer is 1.

# Test 10

```
*Explanation*: After removing nine edges, the tree can be split into ten components, each with 1 vertex. The smallest component has 1 vertex, so the answer is 1.

These test cases cover basic scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the solution handles various configurations of trees and edge removals correctly.
