# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: No games were played, hence no draws could occur.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: One game was played between the second and third player, resulting in a draw.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: There is no way to achieve these scores with valid games and results. The only possible score distribution (1, 1, 1) would require all games to end in draws, but this contradicts the given condition \(p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Two games were played: one between the first and second player (resulting in a win for the second player), and another between the second and third player (ending in a draw). This results in the scores (1, 1, 2).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: There is no way to achieve these scores with valid games and results. The only possible score distribution (3, 3, 3) would require all games to end in draws, but this contradicts the given condition \(p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: Six games were played: three between the first and second player (two wins for the second player, one draw), and three between the second and third player (one win for the second player, two draws). This results in the scores (3, 4, 5).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Two games were played: one between the first and second player (resulting in a win for the second player), and eight between the second and third player (seven wins for the second player, one draw). This results in the scores (1, 1, 10).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
3

6
```
*Explanation*: 
- For the first case, two games were played: one between the first and second player (win for the second player), and another between the second and third player (draw).
- For the second case, the scores cannot be achieved with valid games and results.
- For the third case, six games were played: three between the first and second player (two wins for the second player, one draw), and three between the second and third player (one win for the second player, two draws).
