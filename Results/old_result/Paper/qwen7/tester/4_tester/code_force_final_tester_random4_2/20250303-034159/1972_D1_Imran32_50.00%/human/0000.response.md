# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Only the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition since \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1)\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2) satisfy the condition:
- For (1, 1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- For (2, 1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
- For (2, 2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), and (3, 2) satisfy the condition:
- For (1, 1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- For (2, 1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
- For (3, 1): \(3 + 1 = 4\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\).
- For (3, 2): \(3 + 2 = 5\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(3, 2) = 2\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), and (10, 2) satisfy the condition.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
153
```
*Explanation*: This involves a larger range but the logic remains the same. The pairs that satisfy the condition are calculated based on the gcd and the multiple condition.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
1643498
```
*Explanation*: This is the largest input size. The pairs that satisfy the condition are calculated based on the gcd and the multiple condition, ensuring the solution handles large inputs efficiently.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: Here, \(n = 1\) and \(m = 2000000\). The only valid pairs are \((1, b)\) for all \(b\) from 1 to 2000000, making the count 2000000.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 2000000\). The only valid pairs are \((a, 1)\) for all \(a\) from 1 to 2000000, making the count 2000000.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
4000000000000
```
*Explanation*: Here, \(n = m = 2000000\). The pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = b\) are the only valid ones, and there are 2000000 such pairs, making the total count \(2000000 \times 2 = 4000000000000\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: Here, \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1000000\). The only valid pairs are \((1, b)\) for all \(b\) from 1 to 1000000, making the count 1000000.

These test cases cover basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
