# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, making the sum 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in the sum being 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob multiplies 3 elements by -1, but since all elements are removed, the sum is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob multiplies the largest element 32 by -1, resulting in the sum being -3 - 7 - 3 - 3 - 15 = -31. However, since only one element can be multiplied, the sum becomes -3 - 7 - 3 - 3 - 15 + 32 = -9.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5 elements, leaving 3, 3, 3, 2, 9, 9. Bob multiplies 3 elements by -1, choosing the smallest ones to minimize the sum. The sum becomes 5 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 2 - 9 - 9 = 3.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 6 elements, leaving 1, 8, 2, 9, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 200. Bob multiplies 4 elements by -1, choosing the smallest ones to minimize the sum. The sum becomes 1 + 8 + 2 + 9 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 3 = 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 2 elements, leaving 4. Bob multiplies 1 element by -1, choosing the largest one to minimize the sum. The sum becomes 4 - 4 = 0. However, since Bob can only multiply one element, he multiplies 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 4 - 3 = 1. Since Alice can remove more elements, she removes 4, and Bob multiplies 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 0 - 3 = -3. But since the problem states that Bob can only multiply one element, the correct answer is 4 - 3 = 1 - 2 = -1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-2
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1 element, leaving 3. Bob multiplies 2 elements by -1, choosing the largest one to minimize the sum. The sum becomes 3 - 3 - 1 = -1. Since Bob can only multiply one element, he multiplies 3 by -1, resulting in the sum being 3 - 3 - 1 = -1. But since the problem states that Bob can only multiply one element, the correct answer is 3 - 3 = 0 - 1 = -1.
