# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice does not remove any elements, and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.*

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements, and Bob does not change any elements, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements except one, and Bob multiplies 32 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3 + 7 + 3 + 3 + 15 - 32 = -9.*

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5 elements, leaving 3, 3, 3, 2, 9, 9, and Bob multiplies 9, 9, and 5 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 - 9 - 9 - 5 = -9.*

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 6 elements, leaving 1, 8, 2, 9, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 200, and Bob multiplies 8, 9, and 200 by -1, resulting in a sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 - 8 - 9 - 200 = 0.*

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1 element, leaving 3, and Bob multiplies 3 by -1, resulting in a sum of 1 - 3 = -2. For the second case, Alice removes 1 element, leaving 4, and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in a sum of 1 - 4 = -3. However, since we need to cover the combined input, the output here is -1 as it represents the worst-case scenario for the combined input.*

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1 element, leaving 2, and Bob multiplies 2 by -1, resulting in a sum of 1 - 2 = -1.*

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1 element, leaving 1, and Bob multiplies 1 by -1, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
-1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 2 elements, and Bob does not change any elements, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
-1 -2 -3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements, and Bob does not change any elements, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements, and Bob does not change any elements, resulting in a sum of 0.*

# Test 16
