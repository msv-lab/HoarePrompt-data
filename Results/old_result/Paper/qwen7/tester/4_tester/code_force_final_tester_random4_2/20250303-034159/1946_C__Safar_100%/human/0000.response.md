*Explanation*: After removing the edge between vertex 1 and vertex 3, the tree splits into two components: one with 2 vertices (1 and 2) and another with 3 vertices (3, 4, and 5). The smallest component has 2 vertices, which is the value of `x`.

*Explanation*: After removing any edge, the tree splits into two components, each with 1 vertex. The smallest component has 1 vertex, which is the value of `x`.

*Explanation*: After removing the edge between vertex 2 and vertex 4, the tree splits into two components: one with 2 vertices (1, 2) and another with 4 vertices (3, 4, 5, 6). The smallest component has 1 vertex, which is the value of `x`.

*Explanation*: After removing the edge between vertex 1 and vertex 2, the tree splits into two components: one with 1 vertex (2) and another with 2 vertices (1, 3). The smallest component has 1 vertex, but since we are looking for the minimum size of the largest component, the value of `x` is 2.

*Explanation*: After removing two edges, the tree can split into three components: one with 1 vertex (4), one with 2 vertices (5), and one with 5 vertices (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8). The smallest component has 1 vertex, which is the value of `x`.

The smallest component has 1 vertex, but since we are looking for the minimum size of the largest component, the value of `x` is 2.

*Explanation*: After removing three edges, the tree can split into four components: one with 1 vertex (8), one with 2 vertices (9), one with 2 vertices (10), and one with 5 vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). The smallest component has 1 vertex, but since we are looking for the minimum size of the largest component, the value of `x` is 2.

*Explanation*: After removing four edges, the tree can split into five components: one with 1 vertex (8), one with 1 vertex (9), one with 1 vertex (10), one with 2 vertices (4, 5), and one with 2 vertices (1, 2, 3, 6, 7). The smallest component has 1 vertex, which is the value of `x`.

*Explanation*: After removing nine edges, the tree can split into ten components, each with 1 vertex. The smallest component has 1 vertex, which is the value of `x`.

*Explanation*: For the first test case, no edges are to be removed, so the entire tree remains as one component with 1 vertex. For the second test case, after removing all edges, the tree splits into ten components, each with 1 vertex. The smallest component has 1 vertex, which is the value of `x`.
