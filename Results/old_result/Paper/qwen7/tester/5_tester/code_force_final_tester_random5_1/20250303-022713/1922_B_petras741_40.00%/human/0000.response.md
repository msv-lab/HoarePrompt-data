# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: All combinations of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle since all sticks have the same length.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Only two valid combinations can form a non-degenerate triangle: (3, 2, 1) and (3, 3, 3).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so it is impossible to form a triangle.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
10
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, there are 10 valid combinations that can form a non-degenerate triangle. For the second test case, no combination can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
56
```
**Explanation**: All combinations of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle since all sticks have the same length.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is only one valid combination (0, 0, 0), but since the lengths are zero, it technically forms a degenerate triangle, which is not allowed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: There are four valid combinations that can form a non-degenerate triangle: (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 2).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: There are 20 valid combinations that can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is only one valid combination (2, 2, 2), but since the lengths are the same, it technically forms a degenerate triangle, which is not allowed.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is only one valid combination (2, 2, 2), but since the lengths are the same, it technically forms a degenerate triangle, which is not allowed.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: There are 10 valid combinations that can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: There are 120 valid combinations that can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so it is impossible to form a triangle.
