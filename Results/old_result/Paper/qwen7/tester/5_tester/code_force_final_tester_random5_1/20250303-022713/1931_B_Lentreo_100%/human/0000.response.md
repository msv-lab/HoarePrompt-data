# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container with zero water, which is also trivially possible.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: Two containers with different amounts of water cannot be made equal with the given operation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 15, which is divisible by 5. By pouring water appropriately, we can make each container have 3 units of water.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 6, which is divisible by 3. By pouring water appropriately, we can make each container have 2 units of water.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 28, which is divisible by 7. However, due to the specific distribution, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 28, which is divisible by 7. Similar to the previous case, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Both containers have zero water, making it trivially possible to make them equal.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Two containers with equal amounts of water are already equal.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 55, which is divisible by 10. However, the distribution is such that it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers have the same amount of water, making it trivially possible to keep them equal.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000000000 999999999 999999998 999999997 999999996 999999995 999999994 999999993 999999992 999999991
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 10000000000, which is divisible by 10. However, the distribution is such that it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers have zero water, making it trivially possible to make them equal.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 11, which is divisible by 10. However, the distribution is such that it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
