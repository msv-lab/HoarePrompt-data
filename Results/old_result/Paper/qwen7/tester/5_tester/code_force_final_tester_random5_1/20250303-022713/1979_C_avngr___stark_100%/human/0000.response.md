# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12 
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the number of outcomes is 3 and the multipliers are 3, 2, and 7. The solution provided satisfies the condition that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is another basic test case where the number of outcomes is 2 and the multipliers are both 3. The solution provided satisfies the condition that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the number of outcomes is 5 and the multipliers are all 5. Since the total bet would be 5 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5), which cannot be less than 5 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5) for any positive integer values of x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5, there is no valid distribution of coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the number of outcomes is 6 and the multipliers are 7, 9, 3, 17, 9, and 13. The solution provided satisfies the condition that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the number of outcomes is 3 and the multipliers are 6, 3, and 2. Since the total bet would be 6 * x1 + 3 * x2 + 2 * x3, which cannot be less than 6 * x1 for any positive integer values of x1, x2, and x3, there is no valid distribution of coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24 
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the number of outcomes is 5 and the multipliers are 9, 4, 6, 8, and 3. The solution provided satisfies the condition that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1
10
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
1 
```
*Explanation*: This is an edge case where the number of outcomes is 1. For a single outcome with a multiplier of 10, betting 1 coin results in receiving 10 coins, satisfying the condition.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is an edge case where the number of outcomes is 50 and all multipliers are 2. Betting 1 coin on each outcome results in a total bet of 50 coins, which is less than the winnings of 100 coins for any outcome.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: This is an edge case where the number of outcomes is 1 and the multiplier is 20. Betting 1 coin results in receiving 20 coins, satisfying the condition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This is an edge case where the number of outcomes is 1 and the multiplier is 2. Since the total bet would be 2 * x1, which cannot be less than 2 * x1 for any positive integer value of x1, there is no valid distribution of coins.
