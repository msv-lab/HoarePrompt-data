# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle since all sticks have the same length.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations are (3, 2, 1) and (3, 3, 1). However, (3, 3, 1) does not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem (3 + 1 > 3), so only (3, 2, 1) is valid.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths are 2, 4, and 8. No combination of these lengths can form a triangle.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Only one stick is available, so no combination of 3 sticks can be chosen.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, the valid combinations are (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 5), (0, 4, 5), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 5), (3, 4, 5). For the second test case, no valid combinations exist.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
3
5
0 0 0 0 0
5
1 1 1 1 1
5
2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
10
10
```
**Explanation**: In each case, there are 5 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle since all sticks have the same length.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
56
```
**Explanation**: The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 8 where the lengths are distinct powers of 2 is calculated using combinatorial methods.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 9 where some lengths are repeated but still form valid triangles.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 8, but with different counts of repeated lengths.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
11
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
165
```
**Explanation**: The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 11 where some lengths are repeated multiple times but still form valid triangles.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
12
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
220
```
**Explanation**: The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 12 where some lengths are repeated multiple times but still form valid triangles.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
13
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
286
```
**Explanation**: The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 13 where some lengths are repeated multiple times but still form valid triangles.
