# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks will form a degenerate triangle since all sticks have the same length. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is given by the combination formula \(C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\). The valid combinations to form a non-degenerate triangle are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 3).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\). No combination of these sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side, which is not possible here.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so it is impossible to form a triangle with exactly 3 sticks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, there are 6 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\). The number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle is calculated as follows: \(C(6, 3) - C(3, 3) = 20 - 1 = 19\) (excluding the combination where the largest stick is included, as it cannot form a triangle with any other two sticks). For the second test case, the sticks have lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\), and no combination can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^0, 2^0\). The only way to choose 3 sticks is to pick all three, which forms a degenerate triangle. Since the order does not matter, this counts as one valid combination.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: There are 5 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^1, 2^1, 2^2\). The valid combinations to form a non-degenerate triangle are (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 2).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 2 sticks with lengths \(2^2, 2^2\). No combination of these sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: There are 10 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8, 2^9\). The number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle is calculated as follows: \(C(10, 3) - C(5, 3) = 120 - 10 = 110\) (excluding the combinations where the largest stick is included, as it cannot form a triangle with any other two sticks).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^1, 2^2\). The valid combination to form a non-degenerate triangle is (1, 1, 2).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick with length \(2^0\), so it is impossible to form a triangle with exactly 3 sticks.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: There are 6 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6\). The number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle is calculated as follows: \(C(6, 3) - C(3, 3) = 20 - 1 = 19\) (excluding the combination where the largest stick is included, as it cannot form a triangle with any other two sticks).
