### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an empty array.

**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 0
```
**Explanation**: The array has a single element, which is 0. We can set all elements to 1 using one operation, but since we are not allowed to perform more than 5 * 10^5 operations, we directly set the single element to 1.

### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where all elements are already maximized.

**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already maximized, and no operations are needed.

### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where all elements are the same.

**Input**: 
```
4
2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
8 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum possible value (which is 2 in this case) can be done in one operation.

### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where some elements are the same and others are different.

**Input**: 
```
4
1 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
7 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 3) can be done in one operation.

### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in ascending order.

**Input**: 
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
10 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 4) can be done in one operation.

### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in descending order.

**Input**: 
```
4
4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 4) can be done in one operation.

### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in a mixed pattern.

**Input**: 
```
4
1 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
6 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 3) can be done in one operation.

### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in a random pattern.

**Input**: 
```
4
0 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 3) can be done in one operation.

### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in a pattern with gaps.

**Input**: 
```
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 3) can be done in one operation.

### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in a pattern with large gaps.

**Input**: 
```
4
0 10000000 20000000 30000000
```
**Output**: 
```
60000000 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 30000000) can be done in one operation.

### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in a pattern with large values.

**Input**: 
```
4
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
40000000 0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already maximized, and no operations are needed.

### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in a pattern with negative values.

**Input**: 
```
4
-1 -2 -3 -4
```
**Output**: 
```
0 4
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 0) can be done in four operations.

### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in a pattern with zeros and ones.

**Input**: 
```
4
0 1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 1) can be done in one operation.

### Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in a pattern with zeros and large values.

**Input**: 
```
4
0 10000000 0 10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
20000000 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 10000000) can be done in one operation.

### Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with an array where the elements are in a pattern with zeros and negative values.

**Input**: 
```
4
0 -1 -2 -3
```
**Output**: 
```
0 4
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```
**Explanation**: Setting all elements to the maximum value in the range (which is 0) can be done in four operations.
