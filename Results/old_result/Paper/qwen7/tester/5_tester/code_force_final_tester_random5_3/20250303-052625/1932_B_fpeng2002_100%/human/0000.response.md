```
1
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
**Output**: 
```
36
```
*Explanation*: This is the given example where the tribe waits for the occurrence of the signs in the specified periodicities and calculates the year when the nth sign will occur.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur in consecutive years, so the nth sign occurs in the 5th year.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every year, so the nth sign occurs in the 5th year.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```
**Output**: 
```
2012
```
*Explanation*: This is another example where the signs have different periodicities, and the nth sign occurs in the 2012th year.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: There is only one sign, and it occurs every 10 years, so the nth (which is the only one) sign occurs in the 10th year.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
100 100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
300
```
*Explanation*: All signs have the same periodicity, and the nth sign occurs in the 300th year.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every year, so the nth sign occurs in the 4th year.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in the 2nd year, and the second sign occurs in the 5th year.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Both signs occur every year, so the second sign occurs in the 2nd year.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: There is only one sign, and it occurs in the 1st year.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
36
5
```
*Explanation*: This tests multiple test cases in one input, verifying the function can handle multiple inputs correctly.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
10000000000
```
*Explanation*: All signs have the maximum periodicity, and the nth sign occurs in the 10000000000th year.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: There is only one sign with the maximum periodicity, and it occurs in the 1000000th year.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000001
```
*Explanation*: One sign has the maximum periodicity, and the other occurs every year, so the nth sign occurs in the 1000001st year.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000001
```
*Explanation*: One sign occurs every year, and the other has the maximum periodicity, so the nth sign occurs in the 1000001st year.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: The signs occur every 1, 2, and 3 years respectively, so the nth sign occurs in the 6th year.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 4 8
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
*Explanation*: The signs occur every 2, 4, and 8 years respectively, so the nth sign occurs in the 8th year.
