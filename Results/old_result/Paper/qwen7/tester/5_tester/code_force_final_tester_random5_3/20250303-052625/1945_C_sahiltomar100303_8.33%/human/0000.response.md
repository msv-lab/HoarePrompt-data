```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: If the road is laid after the first house, only 0 out of 1 resident on the left side is satisfied. If the road is laid after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left side and 1 out of 1 resident on the right side are satisfied, making it the optimal solution.

# Test 2
