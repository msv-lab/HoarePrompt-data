# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
153
```
*Explanation*: This is a larger input size but still within the constraints. The exact pairs that satisfy the conditions can be computed using the logic described in the problem statement.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
1643498
```
*Explanation*: This is the maximum possible input size. The exact pairs that satisfy the conditions can be computed using the logic described in the problem statement.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: For \(a = 1\), \(b\) can take any value from 1 to 2000000. Since \(1 + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(1, b)\) (which is \(b\)), there are 2000000 valid pairs.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: For \(b = 1\), \(a\) can take any value from 1 to 2000000. Since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\) (which is 1), there are 2000000 valid pairs.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: For \(a = b\), \(a + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) (which is \(a\)). Therefore, there are 2000000 valid pairs.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1) and (2, 2) satisfy the conditions.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: For \(b = 1\), \(a\) can take any value from 1 to 1000000. Since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\) (which is 1), there are 1000000 valid pairs.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: For \(b = 1\), \(a\) can take any value from 1 to 1000000. Since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\) (which is 1), there are 1000000 valid pairs.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
500000
```
*Explanation*: For \(b = 2\), \(a\) can take values such that \(a + 2\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(a, 2)\). The valid values for \(a\) are 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 1000000. Half of these values will satisfy the condition since \(a + 2\) is always even when \(a\) is odd, and \(a + 2\) is always a multiple of 2 when \(a\) is even. Thus, there are 500000 valid pairs.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The pair (1, 1) satisfies the conditions.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1) and (2, 1) satisfy the conditions.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4

**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: For \(a = b\), \(a + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) (which is \(a\)). Therefore, there are 1000000 valid pairs.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Only the pair (1, 1) satisfies the conditions.
