# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Selling one bun for 5 coins and three buns at the usual price of 4 coins each results in a total profit of \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \) coins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 5 \). Selling all five buns at the modified price of 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5 coins respectively results in a total profit of \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \) coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Selling all ten buns at the usual price of 10 coins each results in a total profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 5 \). Selling all five buns at the modified price of 11, 10, 9, 8, and 7 coins respectively results in a total profit of \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45 \) coins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1000000000 \). Selling all one billion buns at the modified price of 1000000000 coins each results in a total profit of \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Selling one bun at the modified price of 1000000000 coins and the remaining 999999999 buns at the usual price of 1000000000 coins each results in a total profit of \( 1000000000 + 1000000000 \times 999999999 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
500500
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Selling all one thousand buns at the usual price of 1 coin each results in a total profit of \( 1 \times 1000 = 1000 \) coins. However, if we consider \( k = 1 \), selling one bun at the modified price of 1000 coins and the remaining 999 buns at the usual price of 1 coin each results in a total profit of \( 1000 + 1 \times 999 = 1999 \) coins. But since the usual price is 1 coin, the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price, resulting in a total profit of \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \) coins. The correct interpretation here is to maximize the profit from the modified price, which is \( 1000 \times 1000 = 1000500 \) coins, but the problem specifies the usual price as 1 coin, so the correct answer is \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \) coins. The correct interpretation for the given problem is to maximize the profit from the modified price, which is \( 1000 \times 1000 = 1000500 \) coins.
