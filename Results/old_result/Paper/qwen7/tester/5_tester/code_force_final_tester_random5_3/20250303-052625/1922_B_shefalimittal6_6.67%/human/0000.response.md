# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle because all sticks have the same length. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 7 is calculated using the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), which in this case is \( C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35 \).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\). The valid combinations to form a triangle are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 3).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\). No combination of these sticks can form a triangle because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so it is impossible to form a triangle with exactly 3 sticks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, there are 6 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\). The valid combinations to form a triangle are those where the sum of the two smaller sticks is greater than the largest stick. This results in 20 valid combinations. For the second test case, there are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2\), and no combination can form a triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^0, 2^0\). The only valid combination is (0, 0, 0), but since the order does not matter, it counts as 1 way.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: There are 5 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^1, 2^1, 2^2\). The valid combinations are (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1), and (0, 1, 1), but since the order does not matter, it counts as 3 ways.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: There are 10 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8, 2^9\). The number of valid combinations to form a triangle is calculated using the combination formula, resulting in 120 ways.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick with length \(2^0\), so it is impossible to form a triangle with exactly 3 sticks.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 2 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1\), and no combination can form a triangle.
