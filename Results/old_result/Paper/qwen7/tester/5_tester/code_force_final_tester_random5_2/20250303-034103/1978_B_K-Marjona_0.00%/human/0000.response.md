```
1
5 5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 5 \). Selling all five buns at the modified price results in a total profit of \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \) coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Selling all ten buns at the usual price results in a total profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 5 \). Selling all five buns at the modified price results in a total profit of \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45 \) coins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Selling all one billion buns at the usual price results in a total profit of \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 6
**Input**:

1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Selling one bun at 1 coin and the remaining 999999999 buns at 1000000000 coins each results in a total profit of \( 1 + 1000000000 \times 999999999 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 7

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: There is only one bun, so \( k = 0 \) is the optimal choice. Selling the bun at 1 coin results in a total profit of 1 coin.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The modified price is higher than the usual price, so \( k = 0 \) is the optimal choice. Selling the bun at 1 coin results in a total profit of 1 coin.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: The modified price is equal to the usual price, so \( k \) can be any value from 0 to 10. Selling all ten buns at 10 coins each results in a total profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) coins.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 10 \). Selling all ten buns at the modified price results in a total profit of \( 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 \) coins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: Since \( k = 0 \), Bob sells all ten buns at the usual price of 10 coins each, resulting in a total profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) coins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: The modified price is higher than the usual price, so \( k = 0 \) is the optimal choice. Selling the bun at 10 coins results in a total profit of 10 coins.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 100
```
**Output**: 
```
