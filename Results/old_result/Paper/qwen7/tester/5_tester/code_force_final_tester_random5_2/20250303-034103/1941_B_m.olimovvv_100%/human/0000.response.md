# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the array can be reduced to all zeros using the given operations.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2 4 4 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: This array cannot be reduced to all zeros using the given operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: This is another basic test case where the array can be reduced to all zeros using the given operations.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
5 6 0 2 3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The presence of a zero in the array does not guarantee that the entire array can be made zero, especially when other elements cannot be reduced to zero.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 7 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: This test case shows that even if the sum of the array is even, it doesn't necessarily mean the array can be reduced to all zeros.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
7 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: An array with a zero and other non-zero elements cannot be reduced to all zeros.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: All elements are equal and non-zero, which means they cannot be reduced to zero using the given operations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: An array with all zeros can trivially be reduced to all zeros.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: Even if all elements are the same, they cannot be reduced to zero unless they are zero initially.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: An array with all zeros can trivially be reduced to all zeros.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: This large array shows that even with a large number of elements, the array cannot be reduced to all zeros unless all elements are zero.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the handling of very large numbers, confirming that the array cannot be reduced to all zeros unless all elements are zero.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where there is a single non-zero element surrounded by zeros, which cannot be reduced to zero.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where there is a single non-zero element at the end, which cannot be reduced to zero.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where there is a single non-zero element at the beginning, which can be reduced to zero.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where there is a single non-zero element in the middle, which can be reduced to zero.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where there is a single non-zero element followed by zeros, which can be reduced to zero.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the scenario where there are two non-zero elements adjacent to each other, which cannot be reduced to zero.
