# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the subsegment length matches the array b length exactly and k equals m.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only subsegment of length 4 is [1, 2, 3, 4], which is good because all elements match array b.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the subsegment length is greater than the array b length but k equals m.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4 4
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only subsegment of length 4 is [1, 2, 3, 4], which is good because all elements match array b.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the subsegment length is less than the array b length and k is less than m.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are good because they contain at least 2 elements from array b.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are duplicate elements in both arrays.
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3 2
1 2 1 2 3 4
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are good because they contain at least 2 elements from array b.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array b contains repeated elements.
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3 2
1 2 1 2 3 4
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are good because they contain at least 2 elements from array b.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the input size is near the upper limit.
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000 50000
1 2 3 ... 200000
1 2 3 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
150001
```
**Explanation**: There are 150001 subsegments of length 100000 that are good because they contain at least 50000 elements from array b.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the subsegment length is equal to the array b length but k is less than m.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No subsegment of length 4 contains at least 3 elements from array b.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the subsegment length is much larger than the array b length.
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: Subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are good because they contain at least 3 elements from array b.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the array b is empty.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 0 0
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Any subsegment of length 0 is considered good because no elements need to match.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the subsegment length is 1.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 1
1 2 3 4 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Each element in the subsegment of length 1 matches the single element in array b.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the subsegment length is 1 and k is 0.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 0
1 2 3 4 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Even though k is 0, each subsegment of length 1 still matches the single element in array b.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the subsegment length is 1 and k is greater than 1.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No subsegment of length 1 contains at least 2 elements from array b.

# Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the subsegment length is 1 and k is equal to the subsegment length.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 1
1 2 3 4 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Each subsegment of length 1 matches the single element in array b.
