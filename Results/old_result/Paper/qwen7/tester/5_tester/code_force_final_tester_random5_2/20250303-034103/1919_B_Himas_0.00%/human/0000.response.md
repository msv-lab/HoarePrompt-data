# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
+
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The string is "+"</code>, which represents the array [1]. The optimal split is `[1]`, resulting in a penalty of \(|1| \times 1 = 1\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
-----
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The string is "-----", which represents the array [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]. The optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The string is "+-+-+-", which represents the array [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]. The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(0 + 0 = 0\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10
--+++++++-
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The string is "--+++++++-", which represents the array [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]. The optimal split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(2 + 0 = 2\). However, the correct optimal split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(2 + 0 = 2\), but the correct answer is \(4\) because the correct split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, which results in \(2 + 2 = 4\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
20
+---++++-+++++---++
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The string is "+---++++-+++++---++", which represents the array [1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The optimal split is `([1, -1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(4 + 0 = 4\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1
-
2
++
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, the string is "-", which represents the array [-1]. The optimal split is `[-1]`, resulting in a penalty of \(1\).
- For the second test case, the string is "++", which represents the array [1, 1]. The optimal split is `[1, 1]`, resulting in a penalty of \(2\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
++++-
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The string is "++++-", which represents the array [1, 1, 1, 1, -1]. The optimal split is `([1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(4 + 1 = 5\), but the correct optimal split is `([1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(4 + 1 = 5\), but the correct answer is \(2\) because the correct split is `([1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, which results in \(4 + 1 = 5\), but the correct answer is \(2\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
----+++++
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The string is "----+++++", which represents the array [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The optimal split is `([-1, -1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(4 + 5 = 9\), but the correct optimal split is `([-1, -1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(4 + 5 = 9\), but the correct answer is \(3\) because the correct split is `([-1, -1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, which results in \(4 + 5 = 9\), but the correct answer is \(3\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
---
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The string is "---", which represents the array [-1, -1, -1]. The optimal split is `([-1, -1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(3\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
6
+-+--+-
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The string is "+-+--+-", which represents the array [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]. The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(0 + 2 = 2\).
