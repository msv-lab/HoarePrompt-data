# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 2 to get 2, and then Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to form 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Anna has no other possible moves, so Sasha wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 9 to get 9, and then Sasha can concatenate 9 and 56 to form 956, which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna can then reverse 56 to get 65, and Sasha can concatenate 65 and 956 to form 65956, which is still less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Since the last number is less than \(10^5\), Anna wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to get 1, and then Sasha can concatenate 1 and 2007 to form 12007, which is less than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can then reverse 800 to get 800, and Sasha can concatenate 800 and 1580 to form 8001580, which is still less than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Since the last number is less than \(10^{10}\), Sasha wins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 4 to get 4, and then Sasha can concatenate 4 and 30 to form 430, which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna can then reverse 123 to get 321, and Sasha can concatenate 321 and 5000 to form 3215000, which is still less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Since the last number is less than \(10^5\), Anna wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 7 to get 7, and then Sasha can concatenate 7 and 10 to form 710, which is less than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna can then reverse 9 to get 9, and Sasha can concatenate 9 and 10 to form 910, which is still less than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Since the last number is less than \(10^{10}\), Sasha wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number, and it is 6, which is less than \(10^1 = 10\). Therefore, Anna wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number, and it is 10, which is not less than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Therefore, Sasha wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 2 to get 2, and then Sasha can concatenate 2 and 1 to form 21, which is less than \(10^9 = 1000000000\). Anna can then reverse 10 to get 010, and Sasha can concatenate 010 and 9 to form 0109, which is still less than \(10^9 = 1000000000\). Since the last number is less than \(10^9\), Anna wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 10 to get 010, and then Sasha can concatenate 010 and 10 to form 01010, which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna can then reverse 10 again to get 010, and Sasha can concatenate 010 and 10 to form 01010, which is still less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Since the last number is less than \(10^5\), Sasha wins.
