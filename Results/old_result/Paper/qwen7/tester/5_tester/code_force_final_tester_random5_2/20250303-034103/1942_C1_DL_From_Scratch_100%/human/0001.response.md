To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple polygon with a small number of sides and a few chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides and 4 chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a larger polygon and more chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
3
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides and 8 chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 6.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a very large polygon and a small number of chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
3
1000000000 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides and only 2 chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is just enough to form triangles.
**Input**:
```
3
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides and 2 chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is exactly 4.
**Input**:
```
3
4 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides and 2 chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is just enough to form one triangle.
**Input**:
```
3
3 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 3 sides and 2 chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is just enough to form one triangle and one vertex is not chosen.
**Input**:
```
3
3 1 0
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With 3 sides and 1 chosen vertex, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 0.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is just enough to form one triangle and all vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
3
3 3 0
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 3 sides and 3 chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is just enough to form multiple triangles.
**Input**:
```
3
6 3 0
1 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides and 3 chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 3.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is just enough to form multiple triangles and all vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
3
6 6 0
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides and 6 chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 4.
