# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks will form a non-degenerate triangle because all sticks have the same length \(2^1 = 2\). The number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 7 is given by the combination formula \(C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\). The only valid combinations are (3, 2, 3) and (2, 1, 3), which correspond to the 1st, 2nd, and 4th sticks, and the 1st, 3rd, and 4th sticks.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\). No combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the two smaller lengths is always equal to or less than the largest length.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so it is impossible to form a triangle with exactly 3 sticks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 6 such that their lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle is calculated using combinations of lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\). Valid combinations include those where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length. For the second test case, the lengths are \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\), and no combination forms a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All three sticks have the same length \(2^0 = 1\). Any combination of these three sticks will form a non-degenerate triangle, so there is exactly 1 way to choose them.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^1, 2^1, 2^2\). Valid combinations include (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 2), but since order does not matter, we count unique combinations. Here, the unique valid combinations are (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 2), resulting in 4 unique ways.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths \(2^1, 2^1, 2^2, 2^2\). Valid combinations include (1, 1, 2) and (1, 2, 2), and since order does not matter, we count unique combinations. Here, the unique valid combinations are (1, 1, 2) and (1, 2, 2), resulting in 4 unique ways.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All three sticks have the same length \(2^2 = 4\). Any combination of these three sticks will form a non-degenerate triangle, so there is exactly 1 way to choose them.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 1 2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^1, 2^2, 2^2, 2^3\). Valid combinations include those where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length. Counting unique valid combinations, we get 10 ways.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
