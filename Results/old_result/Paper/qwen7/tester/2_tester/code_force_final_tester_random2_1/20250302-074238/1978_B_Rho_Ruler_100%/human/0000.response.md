# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Then he will sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each. The total profit is \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 5 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 5 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45 \).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1000000000 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 1000000000 + 999999999 + \ldots + 1 = 1000000000000000000 \).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Then he will sell one bun for 1 coin and the rest at the usual price for 1000000000 coins each. The total profit is \( 1 + 1000000000 \times 999999999 = 1000000000000000000 \).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
500500
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of \( 1 \times 1000 = 1000 \). However, since the problem asks for the sum of the series from 1 to 1000, the correct profit is \( \frac{1000 \times 1001}{2} = 500500 \).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Then he will sell one bun at the usual price and obtain a profit of \( 1 \).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Since \( b \) (2) is greater than \( n \) (1), Bob will sell the bun at the usual price and obtain a profit of \( 1 \).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Then he will sell one bun for 1 coin and the other bun also for 1 coin. The total profit is \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 3 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 \). However, since \( b \) equals \( n \), the profit is simply the sum of the series from 1 to 3, which is \( 6 \).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 10 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 \). However, since \( b \) equals \( n \), the profit is simply the sum of the series from 1 to 10, which is \( 55 \).

# Test 13
