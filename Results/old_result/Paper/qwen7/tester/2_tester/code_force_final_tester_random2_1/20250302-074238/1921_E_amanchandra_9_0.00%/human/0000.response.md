To address the given problem, we need to implement test cases that cover both basic and edge scenarios. Below are the comprehensive test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic scenario where Alice can win by moving diagonally to Bob's position.

**Input**:
```
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (3, 3), which is Bob's position, and win the game.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic scenario where Bob can win by moving up to Alice's position.

**Input**:
```
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Bob can move to (3, 1), which is Alice's position, and win the game.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic scenario where neither Alice nor Bob can win due to the board boundaries.

**Input**:
```
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is in the last row and cannot move further down. Bob is in the first row and cannot move further up. Thus, the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic scenario where Alice and Bob are on the same row but different columns, and neither can win.

**Input**:
```
5 5 1 4 5 2
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob are on the same row but different columns. Neither can reach the other's position within the rules, so the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic scenario where Alice and Bob are on the same row but different columns, and Alice can win by moving diagonally.

**Input**:
```
5 5 1 3 5 4
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (2, 4) and then to (3, 3), which is Bob's position, and win the game.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the edge scenario where the board size is minimal and Alice can win by moving diagonally.

**Input**:
```
2 2 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (2, 2), which is Bob's position, and win the game.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the edge scenario where the board size is minimal and Bob can win by moving up.

**Input**:
```
2 2 2 2 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Bob can move to (1, 1), which is Alice's position, and win the game.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the edge scenario where the board size is minimal and neither can win.

**Input**:
```
1 2 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is in the last row and cannot move further down. Bob is in the first row and cannot move further up. Thus, the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the edge scenario where the board size is large and Alice can win by moving diagonally.

**Input**:
```
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (2, 7), (3, 8), and finally to (4, 9), which is Bob's position, and win the game.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the edge scenario where the board size is large and Bob can win by moving up.

**Input**:
```
10 10 10 7 10 9
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Bob can move to (9, 8), (8, 9), and finally to (7, 10), which is Alice's position, and win the game.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the edge scenario where the board size is large and neither can win.

**Input**:
```
10 10 1 1 10 2
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is in the last row and cannot move further down. Bob is in the first row and cannot move further up. Thus, the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the edge scenario where the board size is large and Alice and Bob are on the same row but different columns, and neither can win.

**Input**:
```
10 10 1 1 10 2
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob are on the same row but different columns. Neither can reach the other's position within the rules, so the game ends in a draw.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
