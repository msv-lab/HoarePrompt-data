To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there is only one bridge and the maximum distance between supports is within the range of the row width.

**Input**:
```
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are multiple bridges and the maximum distance between supports is within the range of the row width.

**Input**:
```
4 4 2 1
0 3 3 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
0 3 3 0
```
**Output**:
```
8
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there is only one bridge and the maximum distance between supports is very small.

**Input**:
```
4 5 1 1
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
15
```

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there is only one bridge and the maximum distance between supports is equal to the row width.

**Input**:
```
4 5 1 5
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there is only one bridge and the row width is small.

**Input**:
```
1 8 1 1
0 10 4 8 4 4 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
14
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of rows is less than the number of bridges.

**Input**:
```
2 4 3 1
0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of columns is exactly 3.

**Input**:
```
3 3 1 2
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the maximum distance between supports is equal to the row width minus one.

**Input**:
```
3 5 1 4
0 1 2 3 0
0 1 2 3 0
0 1 2 3 0
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the maximum distance between supports is one.

**Input**:
```
3 5 1 1
0 1 2 3 0
0 1 2 3 0
0 1 2 3 0
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where all cells have the same depth.

**Input**:
```
3 5 1 4
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios from basic to edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
