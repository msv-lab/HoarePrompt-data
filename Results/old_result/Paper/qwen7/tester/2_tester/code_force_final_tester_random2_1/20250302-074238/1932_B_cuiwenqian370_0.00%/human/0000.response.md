**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 15 25
```
**Output**: 
```
150
```
*Explanation*: Testing a sequence where the periods are not simple multiples but still have a common multiple.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
3
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
36
5
5
```
*Explanation*: Testing multiple test cases in one input to ensure the function processes multiple inputs correctly.

```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2520
```
*Explanation*: Testing a sequence where the periods are the first 10 natural numbers, which have a known least common multiple.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
