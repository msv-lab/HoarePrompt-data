# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 3 and 10, but not equal to 1 or 5. Valid values are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 5
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 4, which is impossible.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
*Explanation*: k must be in the range [2, 7] excluding 6, 7, 44, 99, 100, and 98. Valid values are 2, 3, 5, which gives us 90 valid numbers from 2 to 101 (since the range is 100 - 10 = 90).

# Test 4

```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
*Explanation*: Same as Test 3.

# Test 5

```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
*Explanation*: Same as Test 3.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2, but not equal to 1 and 2, which is impossible.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1, which means k must be exactly 1, but it cannot be 1. This is impossible.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 10000
2 900000000
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 10000 and 900000000, which gives us 8999900000 - 10000 + 1 = 8999800001 valid numbers, but since we exclude the boundaries, it is 900000000 - 10000 = 800000000.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2, but not equal to 1, 2, and 3. This is impossible.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 10000 and 900000000, excluding 500000000, 10000, and 900000001. The total valid range is 900000000 - 10000 = 899990000, minus the excluded points, which leaves 800000000.
