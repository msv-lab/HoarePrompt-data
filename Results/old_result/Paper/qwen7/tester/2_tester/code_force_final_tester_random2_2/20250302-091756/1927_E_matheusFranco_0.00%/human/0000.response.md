# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
```
*Explanation*: The only possible permutation of length 2 is either `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`. Both permutations satisfy the condition since the difference between the sums of the single segment of length 2 is at most 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 2
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the segments are:
- Segment 1: \(1 + 3 = 4\)
- Segment 2: \(3 + 2 = 5\)

The maximum sum is 5 and the minimum sum is 4, so the difference is 1, satisfying the condition.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the segments are:
- Segment 1: \(1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23\)
- Segment 2: \(8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24\)
- Segment 3: \(4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23\)
- Segment 4: \(10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24\)
- Segment 5: \(2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23\)
- Segment 6: \(7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24\)
- Segment 7: \(5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23\)

The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 23, so the difference is 1, satisfying the condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
13 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the segments are calculated similarly to the previous test case. The maximum and minimum sums will be checked to ensure the difference is at most 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 6 3 7 2 5 4
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the segments are:
- Segment 1: \(1 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 17\)
- Segment 2: \(6 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 18\)
- Segment 3: \(3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17\)
- Segment 4: \(7 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 18\)

The maximum sum is 18 and the minimum sum is 17, so the difference is 1, satisfying the condition.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1 3 2
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the function's ability to handle multiple test cases in a single input. Each sub-case should be handled independently and produce the correct output for each.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
10 4
13 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the function's ability to handle multiple test cases in a single input. Each sub-case should be handled independently and produce the correct output for each.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the function's performance and correctness with the maximum allowed value for \(n\). A simple increasing sequence can be used to ensure the sums of the segments are within the required range.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the function's performance and correctness when \(k = n\). In this case, the entire permutation is a single segment, so the sum is simply the sum of all numbers from 1 to \(n\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 4 2 3
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the segments are:
- Segment 1: \(1 + 4 = 5\)
- Segment 2: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Segment 3: \(2 + 3 = 5\)

The maximum sum is 6 and the minimum sum is 5, so the difference is 1, satisfying the condition.
