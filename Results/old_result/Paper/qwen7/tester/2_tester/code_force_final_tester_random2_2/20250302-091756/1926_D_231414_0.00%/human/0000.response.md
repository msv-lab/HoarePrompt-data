# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: Each number has at least one unique bit position where it differs from the others, requiring each number to be in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The two numbers have different bit patterns across all 31 bits, so they can be placed in the same group.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The numbers have varying bit patterns, but some can share groups while others cannot, leading to a minimum of 3 groups.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1335890506 811593141 1128223362
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Some pairs of numbers can share a group, but there will still be at least two groups needed due to differing bit patterns.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Similar to Test 4, some numbers can share groups while others cannot, resulting in a minimum of 2 groups.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
61545621 2085938026 1269342732 1430258575
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The numbers have more varied bit patterns, requiring a minimum of 3 groups.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Two zeros and two maximum values can be split into two groups, as their bit patterns differ in the most significant bit.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Two zeros and one maximum value require two groups since the maximum value has a unique bit pattern.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: The numbers have repeating patterns but still require four groups to ensure no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 31 positions.

These test cases cover basic scenarios where the numbers have distinct bit patterns and edge cases where numbers share common patterns but still require separation.
