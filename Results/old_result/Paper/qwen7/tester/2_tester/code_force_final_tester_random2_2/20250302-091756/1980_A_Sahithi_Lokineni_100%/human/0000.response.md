# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are enough problems in the bank to cover all required difficulties for the given number of rounds.

**Input**: 
```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
2
1
```

# Test 2
**Objective**: Check the function's behavior when the number of required rounds is 1 and the bank has fewer than 7 problems (since there are only 7 difficulty levels).

**Input**: 
```
3
6 1
ABCDEF
5 1
ABCDF
4 1
ABCD
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
3
```

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is greater than 1 and the bank has fewer than 7 problems per round.

**Input**: 
```

8 2
ABCDEFAB
7 2
ABCDEFB
6 2
ABCDEF
```
**Output**: 
```

```

# Test 4
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's performance when the number of required rounds is 1 and the bank has exactly 7 problems (one of each difficulty level).

**Input**: 
```

7 1
ABCDEFG
6 1
ABCDEF
5 1
ABCDE
```
**Output**: 
```
0

```

# Test 5
**Objective**: Check the function's behavior when the number of required rounds is 1 and the bank has exactly 7 problems but with duplicate difficulties.

**Input**: 
```
3
7 1
AAAAAAAB
7 1
BBBBBBB
7 1
CCCCCC
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
```

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 1 and the bank has no problems at all.

**Input**: 
```

0 1
""
1 1
A
2 1
AB
```
**Output**: 
```
7

```

# Test 7
**Objective**: Check the function's behavior when the number of required rounds is 1 and the bank has exactly 7 problems but with duplicate difficulties, ensuring the function correctly identifies the need to generate new problems.

**Input**: 
```
3
7 1
AAAAAAA

BBBBBBB
7 1
CCCCCC
```
**Output**: 
```
1

```

# Test 8
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's performance when the number of required rounds is greater than 1 and the bank has fewer than 7 problems per round, ensuring the function correctly calculates the minimum number of new problems needed.

**Input**: 
```
3
8 2
ABCDEFAB
