# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 3, less than or equal to 10, not equal to 1, and not equal to 5. The valid values for k are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 5
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 4, which is impossible. Hence, no value of k satisfies both constraints.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
*Explanation*: k must not be 6, 7, 100, 44, 3, or 99. Additionally, k must be between 2 and 7 inclusive. Therefore, the valid values for k are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, excluding 3 and 6, leaving 4, 5, 7, and the range 2 to 7 excluding these, resulting in 90 valid values.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 5
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 5 and not equal to 5, which is impossible. Hence, no value of k satisfies both constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 5
2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must not be 5 and be less than or equal to 5, which is impossible. Hence, no value of k satisfies both constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
3 100
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The constraint `k must not be 100` is repeated, but since we already have `k must be less than or equal to 98`, it is redundant and does not change the result. The valid values for k are those between 2 and 7, excluding 3 and 6, which results in 0 valid values due to the overlap with the "not equal to" constraints.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 5 and 10, and between 9 and 2, which is impossible. Hence, no value of k satisfies both constraints.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: k must be greater than or equal to 1, not equal to 1, 2, and 3, which is impossible. Hence, no value of k satisfies all constraints.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
*Explanation*: k must be between 10000 and 900000000, and not equal to 500000000, 10000, or 900000001. This leaves a range from 10001 to 899999999, excluding the three specific values, resulting in 800000000 valid values.
