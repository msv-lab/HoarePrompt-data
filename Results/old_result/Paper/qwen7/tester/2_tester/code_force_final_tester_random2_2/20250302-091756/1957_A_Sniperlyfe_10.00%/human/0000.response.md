```
**Output**: 
```
0

2 2 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are six sticks, and four of them can be used to form a square, and the remaining two can form a triangle, but since no stick can be reused, only one polygon (a square) can be formed.

```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: There are nine sticks, and they can be used to form two separate polygons: one with side length 2 (using six sticks) and another with side length 4 (using four sticks).

10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```

1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are ten sticks, five of length 1 and five of length 2. The five sticks of length 1 can form a pentagon, and the five sticks of length 2 can also form a pentagon.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick of length 100, and it is not enough to form any polygon.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
2
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are two sticks of length 100, which can be used to form a degenerate triangle (a straight line), but since we consider polygons with at least 3 sides, this does not count. However, if we interpret the problem as allowing degenerate polygons, then it would be valid.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```

**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are three sticks of length 100, which can be used to form an equilateral triangle.
