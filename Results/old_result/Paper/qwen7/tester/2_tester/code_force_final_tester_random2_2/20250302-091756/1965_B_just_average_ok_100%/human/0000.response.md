# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \).
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: The only possible sum that needs to be avoided is 2. A sequence of length 1 with a single element 1 will suffice because no subsequence of [1] sums to 2.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: Since \( k = 1 \), we need to avoid having any subsequence summing to 1. We can achieve this by using a sequence of length 5 with elements 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This ensures no subsequence sums to 1, and every integer from 2 to 6 has a subsequence sum equal to itself.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 8 \).
**Input**: 
```
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: Since \( k = 8 \), we need to avoid having any subsequence summing to 8. We can achieve this by using a sequence of length 7 with seven 1s. This ensures no subsequence sums to 8, and every integer from 1 to 7 has a subsequence sum equal to itself.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 9 \) and \( k = 3 \).
**Input**: 
```
9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Explanation**: Since \( k = 3 \), we need to avoid having any subsequence summing to 3. We can achieve this by using a sequence of length 4 with elements 7, 1, 4, and 1. This ensures no subsequence sums to 3, and every integer from 1 to 8 has a subsequence sum equal to itself.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 7 \).
**Input**: 
```
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
**Explanation**: Since \( k = 7 \), we need to avoid having any subsequence summing to 7. We can achieve this by using a sequence of length 4 with elements 1, 2, 8, and 3. This ensures no subsequence sums to 7, and every integer from 1 to 6 and 8 to 10 has a subsequence sum equal to itself.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: The only possible sum that needs to be avoided is 1. A sequence of length 1 with a single element 1 will suffice because no subsequence of [1] sums to 1.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
**Explanation**: The only possible sum that needs to be avoided is 1. A sequence of length 1 with a single element 2 will suffice because no subsequence of [2] sums to 1.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 10^6 \) and \( k = 10^6 \).
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1000000
```
**Explanation**: The only possible sum that needs to be avoided is \( 10^6 \). A sequence of length 1 with a single element \( 10^6 \) will suffice because no subsequence of [10^6] sums to \( 10^6 \).

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 10^6 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
999999
1 2 3 ... 999999
```
**Explanation**: Since \( k = 1 \), we need to avoid having any subsequence summing to 1. We can achieve this by using a sequence of length 999999 with elements 1 through 999999. This ensures no subsequence sums to 1, and every integer from 2 to \( 10^6 \) has a subsequence sum equal to itself.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 10^6 \) and \( k = 10^6 / 2 \).
**Input**: 
```
1000000 500000
```
**Output**: 
```
500000
1 2 3 ... 500000
```
**Explanation**: Since \( k = 500000 \), we need to avoid having any subsequence summing to 500000. We can achieve this by using a sequence of length 500000 with elements 1 through 500000. This ensures no subsequence sums to 500000, and every integer from 1 to 499999 and 500001 to \( 10^6 \) has a subsequence sum equal to itself.
