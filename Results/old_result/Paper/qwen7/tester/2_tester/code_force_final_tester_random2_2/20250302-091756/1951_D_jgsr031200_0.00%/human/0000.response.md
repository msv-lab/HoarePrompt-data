**Explanation**: With 100 coins and a requirement of 60 jewels, setting the price of each jewel to 1 coin will allow Alice to buy exactly 60 jewels, one from each of the 60 stalls.

# Test 35
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when Alice has just enough coins to buy exactly k jewels with multiple stalls, but the prices are very low and the number of stalls is less than 60.
**Input**:
