1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Then he will sell one bun for 1 coin, and the remaining \( 999999999 \) buns at the usual price for 1000000000 coins each. The total profit is \( 1 + 1000000000 \times 999999999 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: There is only one bun, so \( k \) must be 0. The profit is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \) coin.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Since \( b \) (10) is greater than \( n \) (1), \( k \) must be 0. The profit is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \) coin.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 10 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price, obtaining a profit of \( 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 \) coins.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: Since \( b \) (1) is less than \( n \) (10), \( k \) must be 0. The profit is \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) coins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
108
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 2 \). Then he will sell two buns at the modified price and eight buns at the usual price, obtaining a profit of \( 10 + 9 + 10 \times 8 = 108 \) coins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
110
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 10 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price, obtaining a profit of \( 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 \) coins, and then add the usual price for the remaining buns, which in this case is zero since \( k = n \).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Then he will sell one bun for 2 coins and nine buns at the usual price for 1 coin each, obtaining a profit of \( 2 + 1 \times 9 = 3 \) coins.

# Test 15

```
1
10 10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
110
