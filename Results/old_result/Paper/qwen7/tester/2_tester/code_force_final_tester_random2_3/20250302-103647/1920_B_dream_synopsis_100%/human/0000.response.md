# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, and the sum becomes 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in the sum being 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob multiplies 3 elements by -1, but since all elements are removed, the sum is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob multiplies 1 element by -1, resulting in the sum being -32, which is -9 when considering the remaining elements.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5 elements. Bob multiplies 3 elements by -1, resulting in the sum being -5 - 5 - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = -9.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 6 elements. Bob multiplies 4 elements by -1, but since all elements are removed, the sum is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1 element. Bob multiplies 1 element by -1, resulting in the sum being -4 + 3 = -1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-2
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1 element. Bob multiplies 2 elements by -1, resulting in the sum being -1 - 3 = -4, but since he can only multiply 1 element, the sum is -1 - 3 = -4, which simplifies to -2.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 9 elements. Bob multiplies 4 elements by -1, but since all elements are removed, the sum is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 2 elements. Bob multiplies 1 element by -1, resulting in the sum being -4 + 3 = -1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, and the sum becomes 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes the only element, and the sum becomes 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
-1 -2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 1 element. Bob multiplies the remaining element by -1, resulting in the sum being -(-1) -2 = -1.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 2
-1 -2 -3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 2 elements. Bob multiplies the remaining element by -1, resulting in the sum being -(-1) - (-2) - (-3) = 0.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes all elements. Bob multiplies all elements by -1, resulting in the sum being 0.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 1
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Alice removes 5 elements. Bob multiplies 1 element by -1, resulting in the sum being -1.
