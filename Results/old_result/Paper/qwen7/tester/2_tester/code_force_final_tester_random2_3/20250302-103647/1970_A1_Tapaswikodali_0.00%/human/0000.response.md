# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
(((())))
```
**Output**: 
```
(((())))
```
**Explanation**: The input is already balanced and has a simple structure. The expected output should be the same as the input since no shuffle operation is needed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
(()()(()()))
```
**Output**: 
```
(()()(()()))
```
**Explanation**: The input is a balanced sequence. After computing the prefix balances and sorting, the resulting sequence remains the same as the input.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
((((((()))))))
```
**Output**: 
```
((((((()))))))
```
**Explanation**: The input is already balanced and has a simple structure. The expected output should be the same as the input since no shuffle operation is needed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
((((((()))))))()
```
**Output**: 
```
((((((()))))))()
```
**Explanation**: The input is a balanced sequence with an additional closing parenthesis at the end. After computing the prefix balances and sorting, the resulting sequence remains the same as the input.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
((((((())))))(()))
```
**Output**: 
```
((((((())))))(()))
```
**Explanation**: The input is a balanced sequence. After computing the prefix balances and sorting, the resulting sequence remains the same as the input.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
((((((()))))))(())
```
**Output**: 
```
((((((()))))))(())
```
**Explanation**: The input is a balanced sequence. After computing the prefix balances and sorting, the resulting sequence remains the same as the input.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
((((((())))))(()))
```
**Output**: 
```
((((((())))))(()))
```
**Explanation**: The input is a balanced sequence. After computing the prefix balances and sorting, the resulting sequence remains the same as the input.
