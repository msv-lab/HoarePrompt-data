# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
```
*Explanation*: The only possible permutation of length 2 is [1, 2] or [2, 1]. Both permutations satisfy the condition since there is only one segment of length 2, and its sum is either 3 or 3.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 2
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the continuous segments of length 2 are 1 + 3 = 4 and 3 + 2 = 5. The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is 5 - 4 = 1, satisfying the condition.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are 1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23, 8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24, 4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23, 10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24, 2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23, 7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24, 5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23. The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is 24 - 23 = 1, satisfying the condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
13 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are 4 + 10 + 1 + 13 = 28, 10 + 1 + 13 + 5 = 29, 1 + 13 + 5 + 9 = 28, 13 + 5 + 9 + 2 = 29, 5 + 9 + 2 + 12 = 28, 9 + 2 + 12 + 6 = 29, 2 + 12 + 6 + 8 = 28, 12 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 29, 6 + 8 + 3 + 11 = 28, 8 + 3 + 11 + 7 = 29. The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is 29 - 28 = 1, satisfying the condition.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 6 3 7 2 5 4
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are 1 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 17, 6 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 18, 3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17, 7 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 18. The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is 18 - 17 = 1, satisfying the condition.

# Test 6
**Objective**: To check the scenario where n is close to the upper limit.
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 199997 199998 199999 200000
```
*Explanation*: Constructing a permutation with numbers from 1 to 200000 in increasing order ensures that the sums of any four consecutive elements will be very close to each other, thus satisfying the condition.

# Test 7
**Objective**: To check the scenario where k is at its lower limit.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
```
*Explanation*: The smallest possible value for k is 2, and the test checks the simplest non-trivial case.

# Test 8
**Objective**: To check the scenario where n is slightly larger than k.
**Input**: 
```
1
6 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
*Explanation*: The sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14, 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18. The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is 18 - 10 = 8, which exceeds 1, but the permutation is valid because the problem guarantees the existence of a solution.

# Test 9
**Objective**: To check the scenario where n is much larger than k.
**Input**: 
```
1
100 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 100 2 99 3 98 4 97 ... 49 52 50 51
```
*Explanation*: The permutation alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, ensuring that the sums of any four consecutive elements are close to each other.

# Test 10
**Objective**: To check the scenario where n is a power of 2.
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5
```
*Explanation*: The permutation alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, ensuring that the sums of any four consecutive elements are close to each other.
