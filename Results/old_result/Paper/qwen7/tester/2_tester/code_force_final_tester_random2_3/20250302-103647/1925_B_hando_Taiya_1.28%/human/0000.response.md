```
1
10 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [4, 2, 4], which gives a GCD of 2.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small value of \(x\) and a large number of sub-problems.

**Input**:
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which gives a GCD of 1.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a medium value of \(x\) and a medium number of sub-problems.

**Input**:
```
1
24 4
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [6, 6, 6, 6], which gives a GCD of 6.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a medium value of \(x\) and a large number of sub-problems.

**Input**:
```
1
24 8
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], which gives a GCD of 3.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum value of \(x\).

**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [1], which gives a GCD of 1.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum value of \(n\).

**Input**:
```
1
10 1
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [10], which gives a GCD of 10.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum value of \(x\).

**Input**:
```
1
100000000 100000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [1, 1, ..., 1] (100000000 times), which gives a GCD of 1.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum value of \(x\) and the minimum value of \(n\).

**Input**:
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
100000000
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [100000000], which gives a GCD of 100000000.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum value of \(x\) and the maximum value of \(n\).

**Input**:
```
1
100000000 100000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [1, 1, ..., 1] (100000000 times), which gives a GCD of 1.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a case where \(x\) is a prime number.

**Input**:
```
1
7 7
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which gives a GCD of 1.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a case where \(x\) is a multiple of \(n\).

**Input**:
```
1
12 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [4, 4, 4], which gives a GCD of 4.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a case where \(x\) is a multiple of \(n-1\).

**Input**:
```
1
12 4
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The problem can be split into difficulties [3, 3, 3, 3], which gives a GCD of 3.
