*Explanation*: After removing the edge 1-3, the tree splits into two components: one with 2 vertices (1 and 2) and another with 3 vertices (3, 4, and 5). The smallest component has 2 vertices, so the answer is 2.

*Explanation*: After removing any edge, the tree splits into two components, each with 1 vertex. The smallest component has 1 vertex, so the answer is 1.

2
```
*Explanation*: After removing the edge 1-2 or 1-3, the tree splits into two components: one with 2 vertices and another with 1 vertex. The smallest component has 1 vertex, but since we consider the minimum size of the largest component, the answer is 2.

*Explanation*: For the first tree, after removing the edge 1-3, the tree splits into two components: {1, 2} and {3, 4, 5}. The smallest component has 2 vertices, so the answer is 2. For the second tree, after removing the edge 1-2, the tree splits into three components: {1}, {2, 4, 5}, and {3, 6}. The smallest component has 1 vertex, so the answer is 1.
