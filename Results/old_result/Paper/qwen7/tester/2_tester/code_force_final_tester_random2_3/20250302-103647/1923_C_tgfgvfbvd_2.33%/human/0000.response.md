# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the entire array is provided as a single query.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The entire array [1, 2, 1, 4, 5] is a good array because we can find a permutation of this array that satisfies the conditions. For example, [2, 1, 4, 5, 1].

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when a single-element subarray is queried.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: A single-element subarray cannot be good since there is no way to change the element while keeping it positive and different from itself.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when a subarray with all elements equal is queried.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 5
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: If all elements in a subarray are the same, it is impossible to find a permutation where all elements are different and positive.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when a subarray with distinct elements is queried.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The subarray [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is already a good array as it can be permuted to itself, satisfying all conditions.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when a subarray with a mix of repeated and unique elements is queried.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
2 4
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The subarray [2, 1, 4] can be permuted to [4, 2, 1] which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when a subarray with a single repeated element is queried.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
3 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The subarray [1, 4] cannot be made good because there is no way to change the elements while keeping them positive and different from themselves.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the subarray length is less than the array length but still has repeated elements.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
1 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The subarray [1, 2, 1, 4] cannot be made good because there is no way to change the elements while keeping them positive and different from themselves.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the subarray length is 1 and the element is repeated in the full array.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: A subarray of length 1 cannot be good if the element is repeated in the full array.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the subarray length is 2 and both elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: A subarray of length 2 with the same element cannot be good.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the subarray length is 2 and the elements are different.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The subarray [1, 2] is already good as it can be permuted to itself.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the subarray length is 3 and the elements are distinct.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The subarray [1, 2, 3] can be permuted to [3, 2, 1] which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the subarray length is 3 and the elements include a repeated element.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
