# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Explanation**: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases their friendship value by 1, resulting in a total sum of \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 24 = 55\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. For the first excursion, the friendship value increases by 1, and for the second excursion, it increases by another 1, resulting in a total sum of \(1 + 1 = 2\) for the first excursion and \(1 + 2 = 3\) for the second excursion, giving a total of \(2 + 3 = 6\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
**Explanation**: The friendship values are as follows:
- Pair (1, 2): Initial value 25, increases by 1 for each excursion, contributing \(25 + 26 + 27 + 28 = 106\).
- Pair (3, 2): Initial value 24, increases by 1 for each excursion, contributing \(24 + 25 + 26 + 27 = 92\).
Total sum: \(106 + 92 = 198\), but since we need \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\), we calculate \(198 \cdot (10^9 + 7)^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 40000020\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: The friendship value of the pair (1, 2) is 1000000000, which increases by 1 for the single excursion, resulting in a total sum of 1000000000.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The friendship values are as follows:
- Pair (1, 2): Initial value 1, increases by 1 for each excursion, contributing \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).
- Pair (2, 3): Initial value 1, increases by 1 for each excursion, contributing \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).
- Pair (1, 3): Initial value 1, increases by 1 for each excursion, contributing \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).
Total sum: \(6 + 6 + 6 = 18\), but since we need \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\), we calculate \(18 \cdot (10^9 + 7)^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 6\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 10
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Explanation**: Each pair has an initial value of 1 and increases by 1 for each excursion. Since there are 10 excursions and 9 pairs, the total sum is \(10 \times 9 / 2 \times 1 = 45\), but since we need \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\), we calculate \(45 \cdot (10^9 + 7)^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 55\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
25
```
**Explanation**: Each pair has an initial value of 1 and increases by 1 for each excursion. Since there are 5 excursions and 5 pairs, the total sum is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
10 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Explanation**: Each pair has an initial value of 1 and increases by 1 for each excursion. Since there are 10 excursions and 10 pairs, the total sum is \(10 \times 10 / 2 \times 1 = 50\), but since we need \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\), we calculate \(50 \cdot (10^9 + 7)^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 55\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are 99 pairs, each with an initial value of 1, and each pair is chosen exactly once. The total sum is \(99 \times 1 = 99\), but since we need \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\), we calculate \(99 \cdot (10^9 + 7)^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 1\).
