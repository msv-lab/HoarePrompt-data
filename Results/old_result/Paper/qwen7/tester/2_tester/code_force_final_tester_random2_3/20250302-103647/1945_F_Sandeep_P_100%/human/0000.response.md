# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
9 8 14
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
16 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The mushrooms are indexed as 1 (9), 2 (8), and 3 (14).
- The permutation is 3, 2, 1, meaning the magic powers of mushrooms at indices 3 and 2 will become 0 after picking the first mushroom.
- Picking mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 results in a strength of \(2 \times \min(9, 8) = 16\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
9 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- All mushrooms have non-zero magic powers.
- Picking mushrooms with indices 1, 2, and 3 results in a strength of \(3 \times \min(1, 2, 3) = 9\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
8 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The mushrooms are indexed as 1 (1), 2 (2), 3 (3), 4 (4), 5 (5), and 6 (6).
- The permutation is 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, meaning the magic powers of mushrooms at indices 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 will become 0 after picking the first mushroom.
- Picking mushrooms with indices 1 and 6 results in a strength of \(2 \times \min(1, 6) = 2 \times 1 = 2\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 4 6 10 10
2 1 4 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
20 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The mushrooms are indexed as 1 (1), 2 (4), 3 (6), 4 (10), and 5 (10).
- The permutation is 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, meaning the magic powers of mushrooms at indices 2, 1, 4, and 5 will become 0 after picking the first mushroom.
- Picking mushrooms with indices 3 and 4 results in a strength of \(2 \times \min(6, 10) = 2 \times 6 = 12\). However, picking mushrooms with indices 4 and 5 results in a strength of \(2 \times \min(10, 10) = 2 \times 10 = 20\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
2 2 5 5
4 2 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- The mushrooms are indexed as 1 (2), 2 (2), 3 (5), and 4 (5).
- The permutation is 4, 2, 3, 1, meaning the magic powers of mushrooms at indices 4, 2, 3, and 1 will become 0 after picking the first mushroom.
- Picking mushroom with index 3 results in a strength of \(1 \times \min(5) = 5\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 9 10 10
1 4 2 3 5

**Output**: 
```
20 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The mushrooms are indexed as 1 (1), 2 (2), 3 (9), 4 (10), and 5 (10).
- The permutation is 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, meaning the magic powers of mushrooms at indices 1, 4, 2, and 3 will become 0 after picking the first mushroom.
- Picking mushrooms with indices 5 and 4 results in a strength of \(2 \times \min(10, 10) = 2 \times 10 = 20\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- All mushrooms have the same magic power of 1.
- Picking any 3 mushrooms results in a strength of \(3 \times 1 = 3\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
10 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is only one mushroom with magic power 10.
- Picking the only mushroom results in a strength of \(1 \times 10 = 10\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 20
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
20 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- The mushrooms are indexed as 1 (10) and 2 (20).
- The permutation is 1, 2, meaning the magic power of the mushroom at index 1 will become 0 after picking the second mushroom.
- Picking the mushroom with index 2 results in a strength of \(1 \times 20 = 20\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 10 10
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- All mushrooms have the same magic power of 10.
- Picking any 3 mushrooms results in a strength of \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

# Test 11
