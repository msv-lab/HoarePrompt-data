# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 2-nd item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is \(2 - 1 = 1\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes the 1-st item for free and pays for the 2-nd and 3-rd items. Alice's profit is \((3 + 2) - (1 + 2 + 1) = 1\). Bob won't take the 3-rd item for free since this would not change Alice's profit.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
2 1 1 1
4 2 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st and 2-nd items; then Bob takes the 1-st and 2-nd items for free. Alice's profit is \(0\) because she does not get any money from Bob.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 3 4 9 1 3
7 6 8 10 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, 4-th, and 6-th items; then Bob takes the 1-st and 2-nd items for free and pays for the 4-th and 6-th items. Alice's profit is \((7 + 8) - (1 + 3 + 9 + 3) = 15 - 16 = -1\). However, Bob will only pay for the 4-th and 6-th items, so the correct profit is \((7 + 8) - (9 + 3) = 15 - 12 = 3\). But since Bob takes the 1-st and 2-nd items for free, the profit is \(7 + 8 - 9 - 3 = 15 - 12 = 3 - 2 = 7\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the only item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is \(1 - 1 = 0\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy both items; then Bob takes both items for free. Alice's profit is \(0\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st and 2-nd items; then Bob takes the 1-st item for free and pays for the 2-nd item. Alice's profit is \((5 + 6) - (1 + 2) = 11 - 3 = 8\). But Bob will only pay for the 2-nd item, so the correct profit is \((5 + 6) - (2) = 11 - 2 = 9 - 7 = 2\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, 4-th, and 5-th items; then Bob takes 3 items for free and pays for the remaining 2 items. The optimal choice for Bob is to take the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items for free, so Alice's profit is \((6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10) - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25 - 15 = 10\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
10 10
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy both items; then Bob takes 1 item for free and pays for the other. The optimal choice for Bob is to take the 1-st item for free, so Alice's profit is \((10 + 10) - (10 + 10) = 20 - 20 = 0\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy all three items; then Bob takes all three items for free. Alice's profit is \(0\).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
4 0
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy all four items and sell them to Bob, so her profit is \((4 + 3 + 2 + 1) - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 10 - 10 = 0\).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1

1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the only item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is \(1 - 1 = 0\).

```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes 2 items for free and pays for the remaining 1 item. The optimal choice for Bob is to take the 1-st and 2-nd items for free, so Alice's profit is \((4 + 5 + 6) - (1 + 2 + 3) = 15 - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3\).
