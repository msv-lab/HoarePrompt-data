# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le 1\) and \(1 \le b \le 1\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The only pair that satisfies the conditions is (2, 2). For (2, 2), \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 2 = 4\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The only pair that satisfies the conditions is (3, 3). For (3, 3), \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 9\) which is a multiple of \(3 + 3 = 6\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: The pairs that satisfy the conditions are (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3), (6, 6), and (8, 8). For each pair, \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
423
```
*Explanation*: This is a larger input where the solution needs to handle a broader range of values. The exact pairs are numerous but the count is given as 423.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
*Explanation*: This is another large input where the solution needs to efficiently handle the calculation of pairs. The exact count is given as 5933961.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: For both cases, there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions. In the first case, the only possible pairs are (1, 1) and (1, 2), but neither satisfies the condition. In the second case, the only possible pairs are (1, 1) and (2, 1), but only (1, 1) would be considered, and it does not satisfy the condition either.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1000000
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: For both cases, the only possible pairs are (1, 1) and (1000000, 1), but neither satisfies the condition.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: For both cases, the only pair that satisfies the conditions is (2, 2) and (3, 3) respectively.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
1000000 1
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: For both cases, the only possible pairs are (1, 1) and (1000000, 1), but neither satisfies the condition in the first case, and similarly, (1, 1) and (1, 1000000) do not satisfy the condition in the second case.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1000000
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
*Explanation*: For both cases, the only possible pairs are (1, 1) and (1000000, 1), but neither satisfies the condition.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2
2 2
```
*Explanation*: The only pair that satisfies the conditions is (2, 2) for both cases.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2
1000000 1
1 1000000
```
*Explanation*: For both cases, the only possible pairs are (1, 1) and (1000000, 1), but neither satisfies the condition.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1000000
1000000 1
```
*Explanation*: For both cases, the only possible pairs are (1, 1) and (1000000, 1), but neither satisfies the condition.
