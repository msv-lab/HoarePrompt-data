# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
**Output**: 
```
36
```
*Explanation*: This is the example given in the problem statement. It verifies the basic functionality of the solution.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every consecutive year, so the nth sign occurs in the nth year.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every year, so the nth sign occurs in the nth year.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: Only one sign occurs every 1000000 years, so the nth sign occurs in 1000000 years.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs every 2 years, and the second sign occurs every 3 years. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3 is 6, but since we start counting from the first sign, the second sign occurs in the 5th year.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
4 6 9
```
**Output**: 
```
36
```
*Explanation*: The LCM of 4, 6, and 9 is 36. The nth sign occurs in the 36th year.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 10 15 20
```
**Output**: 
```
60
```
*Explanation*: The LCM of 5, 10, 15, and 20 is 60. The nth sign occurs in the 60th year.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```
**Output**: 
```
2012
```
*Explanation*: This is the example provided in the problem statement. It verifies the solution with larger numbers.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1
1
10
1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1000000
```
*Explanation*: Two separate test cases to check the solution with a single sign and a very large periodicity.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
2
2 2
2
3 3
2
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
3
5
```
*Explanation*: Multiple test cases with the same periodicity to check if the solution correctly handles identical periodicities.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29
```
**Output**: 
```
232792560
```
*Explanation*: The LCM of the first ten prime numbers is 232792560. The nth sign occurs in the 232792560th year.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100
1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000000
```
*Explanation*: All signs have the same periodicity, so the nth sign occurs in 100000000000 years.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
*Explanation*: A single sign with a very large periodicity, ensuring the solution can handle large numbers efficiently.
