# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 4. He can move to position 3 by paying 4 coins and then to position 2 by paying 3 coins, totaling 7 coins.
- Alternatively, he can move directly from position 4 to position 2 by paying 4 + 3 = 7 coins.
- However, the optimal strategy is to move from position 4 to position 3 and then to position 2, paying a total of 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 coins. But since he only needs to be in the top 2 positions, moving to position 2 directly is cheaper.

# Test 2
**Input**:

6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 6. He can move to position 5 by paying 5 coins, then to position 4 by paying 1 coin, then to position 3 by paying 8 coins, then to position 2 by paying 8 coins, and finally to position 1 by paying 1 coin, totaling 23 coins.
- However, the optimal strategy is to move from position 6 to position 5, then to position 4, then to position 3, then to position 2, and finally to position 1, paying a total of 5 + 1 + 8 + 8 + 1 = 23 coins. But since he only needs to be in the top 2 positions, moving to position 2 directly is cheaper.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 7. He can move to position 6 by paying 9 coins, then to position 5 by paying 1 coin, then to position 4 by paying 7 coins, then to position 3 by paying 1 coin, then to position 2 by paying 4 coins, and finally to position 1 by paying 9 coins, totaling 30 coins.
- However, the optimal strategy is to move from position 7 to position 6, then to position 5, then to position 4, then to position 3, then to position 2, and finally to position 1, paying a total of 9 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 30 coins. But since he only needs to be in the top 7 positions, moving to position 1 directly is cheaper.
