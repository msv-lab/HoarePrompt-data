# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with a simple scenario where the phone can send all messages without needing to turn off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 3. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, leaving the charge at 0. Since the phone cannot have a negative charge, it is not possible to send the message.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with a simple scenario where the phone can send all messages by turning off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
2 5 1 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 5. By turning off the phone at moment 0 and turning it on at moment 1, the charge will be 5 - 2 = 3. Then, sending a message at moment 1 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 2 units. Turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it on at moment 2 will leave 2 - 2 = 0 units of charge, but since the phone was just turned on, it can still send the message at moment 2.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with multiple messages where the phone can manage the charge by turning off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
3 10 1 2
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 10. By turning off the phone at moment 0 and turning it on at moment 1, the charge will be 10 - 2 = 8. Then, sending a message at moment 1 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 7 units. By turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it on at moment 2, the charge will be 7 - 2 = 5. Sending a message at moment 2 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 4 units. By turning off the phone at moment 2 and turning it on at moment 3, the charge will be 4 - 2 = 2. Sending a message at moment 3 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 1 unit, which is sufficient to send the final message.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone runs out of charge before the last message can be sent.

**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 3. Sending a message at moment 1 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 2 units. By turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it on at moment 2, the charge will be 2 - 2 = 0. Since the phone cannot have a negative charge, it is not possible to send the message at moment 3.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has insufficient charge even after turning off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 1 2
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 2. Sending a message at moment 1 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 1 unit. By turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it on at moment 2, the charge will be 1 - 2 = -1. Since the phone cannot have a negative charge, it is not possible to send the message at moment 2.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can manage the charge optimally by turning off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
4 10 1 2
1 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 10. By turning off the phone at moment 0 and turning it on at moment 1, the charge will be 10 - 2 = 8. Then, sending a message at moment 1 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 7 units. By turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it on at moment 3, the charge will be 7 - 2 = 5. Sending a message at moment 3 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 4 units. By turning off the phone at moment 3 and turning it on at moment 5, the charge will be 4 - 2 = 2. Sending a message at moment 5 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 1 unit. By turning off the phone at moment 5 and turning it on at moment 7, the charge will be 1 - 2 = -1. Since the phone cannot have a negative charge, it is not possible to send the message at moment 7, but the previous steps show the optimal strategy.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a very high initial charge and low charge consumption.

**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000000 1 1000000000
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 1000000000. Sending a message at moment 1 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 999999999 units. Since the charge consumption per unit of time is 1, the phone can easily manage to send the message at moment 1000000000 without running out of charge.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a very high initial charge but high charge consumption.

**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1000000000 1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 10. Sending a message at moment 1 will consume 1000000000 units of charge, which is not possible. Therefore, the phone cannot send the message at moment 1000000000.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a very large number of messages.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 10. By turning off the phone at moment 0 and turning it on at moment 1, the charge will be 10 - 2 = 8. Then, sending a message at moment 1 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 7 units. By turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it on at moment 2, the charge will be 7 - 2 = 5. Sending a message at moment 2 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 4 units. By turning off the phone at moment 2 and turning it on at moment 3, the charge will be 4 - 2 = 2. Sending a message at moment 3 will consume 1 unit of charge, leaving 1 unit. By turning off the phone at moment 3 and turning it on at moment 4, the charge will be 1 - 2 = -1. Since the phone cannot have a negative charge, it is not possible to send the message at moment 4, but the previous steps show the optimal strategy.
