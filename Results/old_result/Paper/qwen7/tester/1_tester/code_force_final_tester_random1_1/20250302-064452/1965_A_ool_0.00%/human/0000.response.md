To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will follow the guidelines provided. We will start with basic test cases and then move on to edge cases to ensure the solution handles all possible scenarios robustly.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the simplest case where all piles have the same number of stones.
**Input**:
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can always win by removing 3 stones from each pile in one move, making all piles empty.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the case where one pile has fewer stones than others.
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 7
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, leaving Bob to choose \(k = 6\) and win.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the case where multiple piles have different numbers of stones but can be reduced to the same number in one move.
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 3 9 7 4 2 100
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) to reduce all piles to 0, winning the game.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the case where the piles have small numbers and can be reduced quickly.
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) to reduce all piles to 0, winning the game.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the case where the piles have a mix of small and large numbers.
**Input**:
```
1
6
2 1 3 4 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) to reduce all piles to 0, winning the game.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where there is only one pile.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) to reduce the pile to 0, winning the game.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are many piles with very few stones.
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 1 ... 1 (199999 times)
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \(k = 1\) to reduce all piles to 0, winning the game.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where the smallest pile has only one stone and all other piles are larger.
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, leaving Bob to choose an appropriate \(k\) and win.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where the smallest pile has only one stone and all other piles are equal.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, leaving Bob to choose \(k = 2\) and win.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the case where the smallest pile has only one stone and all other piles are different.
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose \(k = 1\) on her first turn, leaving Bob to choose an appropriate \(k\) and win.
