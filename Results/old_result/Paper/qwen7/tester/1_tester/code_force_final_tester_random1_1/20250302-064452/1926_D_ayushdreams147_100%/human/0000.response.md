# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: All pairs of numbers have at least one matching bit in their last 31 bits, so each number must be in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The binary representation of 0 is `000...000` and the binary representation of `2147483647` is `111...111`, which means they do not share any bits. Thus, they can be in the same group.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: We need to check the bit positions to determine the minimum number of groups required. This input shows a more complex scenario where multiple numbers might share some bits but not others.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1335890506 811593141 1128223362
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: By checking the bit positions, we can see that these three numbers can be divided into two groups based on their bit patterns.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Similar to Test 4, we need to check the bit positions to determine the minimum number of groups required.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
61545621 2085938026 1269342732 1430258575
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: This input shows a scenario where the numbers cannot be grouped into fewer than three groups.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Two zeros and two maximum values can be grouped into two groups since the maximum value has all bits set to 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Similar to Test 7, but with one less number. The two zeros can be in one group, and the maximum value in another.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: This input shows a scenario where the numbers are repeated and need to be grouped appropriately. The numbers `1858058912` and `289424735` can be grouped together, but the other unique numbers require separate groups.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
