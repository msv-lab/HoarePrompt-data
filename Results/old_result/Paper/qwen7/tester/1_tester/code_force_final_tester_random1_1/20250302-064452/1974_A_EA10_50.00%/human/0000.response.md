To address the given problem, we need to implement a function that calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on their sizes. Below are the comprehensive test cases, including both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon. The 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, which fits into one 5x3 grid, leaving 1 cell free. The 1x1 icon can fit into the remaining space.

#### Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
7 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Seven 1x1 icons and two 2x2 icons. Two 2x2 icons require 8 cells, which fits into one 5x3 grid, leaving 1 cell free. The seven 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.

#### Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
12 4
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Twelve 1x1 icons and four 2x2 icons. Four 2x2 icons require 16 cells, which cannot fit into one 5x3 grid (15 cells available). Therefore, we need two screens.

#### Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
0 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Three 2x2 icons. Three 2x2 icons require 12 cells, which cannot fit into one 5x3 grid (15 cells available). Therefore, we need two screens.

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One 1x1 icon and no 2x2 icons. The 1x1 icon can fit into one 5x3 grid.

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
8 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Eight 1x1 icons and one 2x2 icon. One 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, which fits into one 5x3 grid, leaving 11 cells free. The eight 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No icons. No screens are needed.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Two 1x1 icons and no 2x2 icons. The two 1x1 icons can fit into one 5x3 grid.

#### Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
15 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Fifteen 1x1 icons and no 2x2 icons. Fifteen 1x1 icons can fit into one 5x3 grid.

#### Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
8 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Eight 1x1 icons and two 2x2 icons. Two 2x2 icons require 8 cells, which fits into one 5x3 grid, leaving 7 cells free. The eight 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space, but since we have two 2x2 icons, we need two screens.

#### Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
0 9
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: No 1x1 icons and nine 2x2 icons. Nine 2x2 icons require 36 cells, which cannot fit into one 5x3 grid (15 cells available). Therefore, we need five screens.
