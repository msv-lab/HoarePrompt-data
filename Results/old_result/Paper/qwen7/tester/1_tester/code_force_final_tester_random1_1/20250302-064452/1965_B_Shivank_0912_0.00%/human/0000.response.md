**Input**: 
```
1
8 8
```
**Output**:

4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
*Explanation*: We need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 4, but every number from 1 to 4 must have a subsequence summing to it. A sequence `[1, 2, 3]` satisfies these conditions.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5

```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
```
*Explanation*: We need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 1000, but every number from 1 to 1000 must have a subsequence summing to it. A sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., 25]` satisfies these conditions.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

*Explanation*: We need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 1000000, but every number from 1 to 1000000 must have a subsequence summing to it. A sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., 25]` satisfies these conditions.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
999975
1 1 1 ... 1 (999975 times)
```
*Explanation*: We need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 1, but every number from 1 to 1000000 must have a subsequence summing to it. A sequence of 999975 ones satisfies these conditions.
