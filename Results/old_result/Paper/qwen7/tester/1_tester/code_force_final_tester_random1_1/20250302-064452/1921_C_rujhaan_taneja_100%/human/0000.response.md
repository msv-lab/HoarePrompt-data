# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where the phone has enough charge to send all messages without turning it off.

**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 consumes 3 units of charge, leaving the phone with 0 charge. Therefore, it is not possible to send the message.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where the phone has just enough charge to send all messages without turning it off.

**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit of charge, leaving 2 units. Sending another message at moment 2 consumes 1 more unit, leaving 1 unit. Since the phone still has charge, it is possible to send both messages.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where the phone has enough charge to send all messages but requires turning it off once.

**Input**: 
```
1
2 5 1 5
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 5 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 4 units. Turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it back on at moment 2 consumes 5 units, leaving -1 units. However, since the phone was turned off before the next message, it is possible to send the message at moment 2.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where the phone has enough charge to send all messages but requires multiple turns off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
3 10 1 5
1 3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 9 units. Turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it back on at moment 2 consumes 5 units, leaving 4 units. Sending a message at moment 3 consumes 1 unit, leaving 3 units. Turning off the phone at moment 3 and turning it back on at moment 4 consumes 5 units, leaving -2 units. However, since the phone was turned off before the next message, it is possible to send the message at moment 5.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone runs out of charge before sending all messages.

**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 1 5
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 2 units. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 2 more units, leaving 0 units. Since the phone runs out of charge before the second message can be sent, it is not possible to send all messages.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a very high charge consumption rate and a low energy cost for turning off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 9 1
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 9 units, leaving 1 unit. Turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it back on at moment 10 consumes 1 unit, leaving 0 units. Since the phone runs out of charge before the second message can be sent, it is not possible to send all messages.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a very high energy cost for turning off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 10
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 9 units. Turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it back on at moment 10 consumes 10 units, leaving -1 units. Since the phone runs out of charge before the second message can be sent, it is not possible to send all messages.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a very large number of messages and a small initial charge.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 1 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1 unit of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 0 units. Since the phone runs out of charge before the second message can be sent, it is not possible to send all messages.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a very large number of messages and a small initial charge but can turn off and on to save charge.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 1 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 2 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 1 unit. Turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it back on at moment 2 consumes 1 unit, leaving 0 units. However, since the phone was turned off before the next message, it is possible to send the message at moment 2.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a very large number of messages and a small initial charge but can turn off and on to save charge, with a large energy cost for turning off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 1 10
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 2 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 1 unit. Turning off the phone at moment 1 and turning it back on at moment 2 consumes 10 units, leaving -9 units. Since the phone runs out of charge before the second message can be sent, it is not possible to send all messages.
