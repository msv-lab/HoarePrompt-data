```
1
1 1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is only one permutation of length 1, which is `[1]`. Both the prefix and suffix maximums are at index 1, so there is only one valid permutation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 3
1 2
2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1 and 2, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 2, 3, and 4. The valid permutations are `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, `[2, 4, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 4, 2, 1]`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 3
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, and 3, and the index of the suffix maximum is at position 3. The only valid permutation is `[3, 2, 1]`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 4
1 2 3
2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, and 3, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5. There is no permutation that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
20 5 4
1 2 3 4 12
12 13 18 20
```
**Output**: 
```
317580808
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 12, 13, 18, and 20. The number of valid permutations is 317580808, which is calculated using combinatorial methods.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2 3
1 3
3 4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1 and 3, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 3, 4, and 6. The valid permutations are `[2, 1, 6, 5, 3, 4]`, `[3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]`, `[3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4]`, `[4, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3]`, `[4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3]`, `[4, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2]`, `[5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 3]`, `[5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3]`, `[5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]`, and `[5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 2]`.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is a duplicate of Test 1, ensuring consistency in handling the simplest case.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All indices are prefix and suffix maximums, meaning the only valid permutation is `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 1
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is no permutation where the maximum of the prefix and the maximum of the suffix are at different positions.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
1 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Both prefix and suffix maximums are at the same positions, making it impossible to satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3 3
1 3 7
7 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 3, and 7, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 7, 9, and 10. The number of valid permutations is 120, calculated using combinatorial methods.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 1
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only prefix and suffix maximums are at the start and end, meaning the only valid permutation is `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Every position is both a prefix and suffix maximum, meaning the only valid permutation is `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 5
1 3 5 7 9
2 4 6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: The indices of the prefix maximums are at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, and the indices of the suffix maximums are at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The number of valid permutations is 120, calculated using combinatorial methods.
