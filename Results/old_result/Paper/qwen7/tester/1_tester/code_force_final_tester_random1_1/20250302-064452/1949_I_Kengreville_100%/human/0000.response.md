To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Simple Configuration with Tangent Disks

**Input**:
```
5
0 2 1
0 0 1
4 -3 4
11 0 3
11 5 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 2: Configuration with Overlapping Disks
**Objective**: Ensure the algorithm correctly identifies a configuration where disks are not tangent and cannot be adjusted to meet the criteria.

**Input**:
```
4
2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 3: Single Disk Configuration
**Objective**: Verify that a single disk does not require any changes and is considered valid.

**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 4: Multiple Tangent Disks with Decreasing Radii
**Objective**: Verify that multiple disks can be adjusted to maintain tangency and decrease the total radius.

**Input**:
```
3
0 0 2
3 0 2
6 0 2

**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 5: Configuration with Large Radii

0 0 1000000000
1 0 1000000000
2 0 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6: Configuration with Very Close Disks
**Objective**: Verify that the algorithm can handle very close disks where the distance between centers is just slightly more than the sum of their radii.

**Input**:
```
2
0 0 1
0 0 1.000000001
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 7: Configuration with Disks on the Same Line
**Objective**: Verify that the algorithm can handle disks lying on the same line.

**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 8: Configuration with Disks Just Tangent
**Objective**: Verify that the algorithm can handle disks that are just tangent.

**Input**:
```
2
0 0 1
1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 9: Configuration with Disks at Maximum Radius
**Objective**: Verify that the algorithm can handle disks at their maximum possible radius.

**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1000000000
1 0 1000000000
2 0 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 10: Configuration with Disks at Minimum Radius
**Objective**: Verify that the algorithm can handle disks at their minimum possible radius.

**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 11: Configuration with Disks at Maximum and Minimum Radius
**Objective**: Verify that the algorithm can handle a mix of disks at different radii.

**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1000000000
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 12: Configuration with Disks at Extreme Coordinates
**Objective**: Verify that the algorithm can handle disks with extreme coordinates.

**Input**:
```
3
-1000000000 0 1
0 0 1000000000
1000000000 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
