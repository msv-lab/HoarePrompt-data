# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \).
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: The only subsequence that sums to 2 is the entire sequence itself, which is not allowed. Hence, the sequence `[1]` satisfies the condition since no subsequence sums to 2.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 1 because all elements are greater than 1. All other integers between 1 and 6 have subsequences that sum to them.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 8 \).
**Input**: 
```
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 8 because all elements are less than 8. All other integers between 1 and 8 have subsequences that sum to them.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 9 \) and \( k = 3 \).
**Input**: 
```
9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 3. Subsequences exist for all other integers between 1 and 9.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 7 \).
**Input**: 
```
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 7. Subsequences exist for all other integers between 1 and 10.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum value of \( n \) and \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1000000
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 1000000. All other integers between 1 and 1000000 have subsequences that sum to them.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum value of \( n \) and \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This is the same as Test 1, ensuring consistency across different inputs.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n = k \).
**Input**: 
```
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 5. The sequence `[1]` ensures no subsequence sums to 5, and all other integers between 1 and 4 have subsequences that sum to them.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is slightly larger than \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
6 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 5
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 5. The sequence `[1, 5]` ensures no subsequence sums to 5, and all other integers between 1 and 4 have subsequences that sum to them.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is much larger than \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
100 50
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 50
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 50. The sequence `[1, 50]` ensures no subsequence sums to 50, and all other integers between 1 and 49 have subsequences that sum to them.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is exactly 25.
**Input**: 
```
25 15
```
**Output**: 
```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 15. The sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` ensures no subsequence sums to 15, and all other integers between 1 and 14 have subsequences that sum to them.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( k \) is close to \( n \).
**Input**: 
```
10 9
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 9
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 9. The sequence `[1, 9]` ensures no subsequence sums to 9, and all other integers between 1 and 8 have subsequences that sum to them.

# Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( k \) is 1.
**Input**: 
```
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
9
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 1. The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` ensures no subsequence sums to 1, and all other integers between 2 and 10 have subsequences that sum to them.
