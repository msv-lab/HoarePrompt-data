# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
*Explanation*: Kirill needs to bribe the first person (7 coins) and the second person (3 coins) to move to the first two positions. The total cost is 7 + 3 + 4 = 14 coins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
*Explanation*: Kirill needs to bribe the first person (6 coins), the second person (9 coins), and the third person (7 coins) to move to the first three positions. The total cost is 6 + 9 + 7 + 5 = 27 coins. However, since he only needs to be in the first two positions, he can skip bribing the third person, resulting in 6 + 9 + 5 + 2 = 22 coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
10 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: Kirill needs to bribe the first person (7 coins), the second person (2 coins), and the third person (9 coins) to move to the first three positions. The total cost is 7 + 2 + 9 + 1 = 19 coins. Since he needs to be in the first seven positions, he doesn't need to move further, resulting in 7 + 2 + 9 = 18 coins. However, the optimal path is to move directly to the seventh position without intermediate bribes, resulting in 9 coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Kirill needs to bribe the first person (2 coins) to move to the first position. The total cost is 2 + 1 = 3 coins.

# Test 5

```
**Output**: 
```

3
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, Kirill is already in the first position, so no coins are needed. In the second test case, Kirill needs to bribe the first person (1 coin), the second person (2 coins), and the third person (3 coins) to move to the first three positions. The total cost is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 coins. However, since he only needs to be in the first three positions, the optimal path is to move directly to the third position, resulting in 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
10 20 30 40 50
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: Kirill needs to bribe the first person (10 coins), the second person (20 coins), and the third person (30 coins) to move to the first three positions. The total cost is 10 + 20 + 30 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 66 coins. However, since he only needs to be in the first two positions, he can skip bribing the third person, resulting in 10 + 20 + 1 + 2 = 33 coins. The optimal path is to move directly to the second position, resulting in 10 + 1 = 11 coins. The next optimal path is to move to the first position, resulting in 10 coins. The total cost is 10 + 1 + 4 = 15 coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Kirill needs to bribe the first person (1 coin), the second person (2 coins), and the third person (3 coins) to move to the first three positions. The total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8 coins. However, since he only needs to be in the first three positions, the optimal path is to move directly to the third position, resulting in 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```

4 1
1 2 3 4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Kirill needs to bribe the first person (1 coin), the second person (2 coins), the third person (3 coins), and the fourth person (4 coins) to move to the first four positions. The total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 12 coins. However, since he only needs to be in the first position, the optimal path is to move directly to the first position, resulting in 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 coins. The next optimal path is to move to the second position, resulting in 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins. The next optimal path is to move to the third position, resulting in 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins. The next optimal path is to move to the fourth position, resulting in 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins. The total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 coins.
