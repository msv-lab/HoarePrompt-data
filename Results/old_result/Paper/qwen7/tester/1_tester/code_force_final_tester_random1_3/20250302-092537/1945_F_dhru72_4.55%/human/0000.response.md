# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1

9 8 14
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
16 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The optimal strategy is to pick mushrooms at indices 1 and 2. The minimum magic power among these mushrooms is 8, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 2. Therefore, the elixir strength is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
9 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- The optimal strategy is to pick mushrooms at indices 1, 2, and 3. The minimum magic power among these mushrooms is 1, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 3. Therefore, the elixir strength is \(3 \times 1 = 3\). However, since we need to maximize the strength while minimizing the number of mushrooms, we can pick mushrooms at indices 2, 3, and 4, which gives us a strength of \(3 \times 2 = 6\), and then pick the next best option, which is mushrooms at indices 1, 2, and 3, giving us a strength of \(3 \times 1 = 3\) and a total of 3 mushrooms.
