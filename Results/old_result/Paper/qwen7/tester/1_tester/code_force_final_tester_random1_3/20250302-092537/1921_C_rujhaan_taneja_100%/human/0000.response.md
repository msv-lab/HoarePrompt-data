# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, depleting the battery to 0. Turning off and on consumes 5 units of charge, making it impossible to send the message.*

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 21 units of charge. By strategically turning off and on, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of power.*

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. By turning off and on at strategic moments, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of power.*

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 1 billion units of charge but consumes 1 billion units per second and 1 billion units for turning off and on. It is impossible to send the message at the given moment without running out of power.*

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 11 units of charge. Sending messages at moments 6, 8, and 10 would consume more than the available charge, making it impossible to send all messages.*

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
12 621526648 2585904 3566299
51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 621526648 units of charge. By carefully managing the charge usage and turning off and on at appropriate moments, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of power.*

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3 1 5
3
1 3 5
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
YES
```
*Explanation*: The first test case is identical to Test 1, resulting in "NO". The second test case is identical to Test 3, resulting in "YES".*

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 1 billion units of charge but consumes 1 billion units per second and 1 billion units for turning off and on. It is impossible to send the message at the given moment without running out of power, even with the minimum charge needed for turning off and on.*

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 1 unit of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 would consume 1 unit of charge, depleting the battery to 0. Turning off and on consumes 1 unit of charge, making it impossible to send the message.*

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1 1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 10 would consume 10 units of charge, depleting the battery to 0. However, since the charge is exactly equal to the time difference, turning off and on at the start allows the phone to send the message without running out of power.*

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1 2
10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 10 would consume 10 units of charge, depleting the battery to 0. Turning off and on consumes 2 units of charge, making it impossible to send the message.*

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 2 1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 10 would consume 10 units of charge, depleting the battery to 0. Turning off and on consumes 2 units of charge, making it impossible to send the message.*

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1 2
5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 5 would consume 5 units of charge, leaving 5 units. Turning off and on consumes 2 units of charge, allowing the phone to manage the charge and send the message without running out of power.*

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. By turning off and on at strategic moments, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of power.*
