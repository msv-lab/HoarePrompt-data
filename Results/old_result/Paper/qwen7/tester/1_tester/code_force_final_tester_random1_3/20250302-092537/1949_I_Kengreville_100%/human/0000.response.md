# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
5
0 2 1
0 0 1
4 -3 4
11 0 3
11 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This is the example provided in the problem statement. The disks are arranged in such a way that their tangency can be maintained while decreasing the total radius.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 2
3 0 2
6 0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: All three disks have the same radius and are tangent to each other. Decreasing the radius of any disk would cause overlap with another disk, so it is impossible to decrease the total radius without violating the tangency condition.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The two disks are tangent to each other. By slightly decreasing the radius of one disk and increasing the radius of the other, the tangency can be maintained, and the total radius can be decreased.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: All four disks are tangent to each other and to the adjacent disks. Any attempt to decrease the radius of one disk will cause overlap with its neighbors, making it impossible to decrease the total radius.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is only one disk, so it is impossible to decrease its radius without causing overlap, as there are no other disks to maintain tangency with.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
6
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
4 0 1
5 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: All six disks are tangent to each other and to the adjacent disks. Any attempt to decrease the radius of one disk will cause overlap with its neighbors, making it impossible to decrease the total radius.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The first two disks are tangent to each other, and the third disk is tangent to both. By slightly decreasing the radius of the third disk and increasing the radius of the first disk, the tangency can be maintained, and the total radius can be decreased.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 2
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: One disk has a larger radius than the other. By decreasing the radius of the larger disk and increasing the radius of the smaller disk, the tangency can be maintained, and the total radius can be decreased.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The first two disks are tangent to each other, and the third disk is tangent to both. Decreasing the radius of the third disk would cause overlap with the first two disks, making it impossible to decrease the total radius.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks form a square arrangement where each disk is tangent to two others. By slightly decreasing the radius of the fourth disk and increasing the radius of the first disk, the tangency can be maintained, and the total radius can be decreased.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The two disks are tangent to each other. By slightly decreasing the radius of one disk and increasing the radius of the other, the tangency can be maintained, and the total radius can be decreased.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The first two disks are tangent to each other, and the third disk is tangent to both. By slightly decreasing the radius of the third disk and increasing the radius of the first disk, the tangency can be maintained, and the total radius can be decreased.
