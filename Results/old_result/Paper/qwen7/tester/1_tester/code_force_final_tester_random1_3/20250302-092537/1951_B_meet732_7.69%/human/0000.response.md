To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Hereâ€™s how we can structure the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test Case 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the cow is already in a favorable position to win many matches.

**Input**:
```
3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Cow 1 starts in position 1 and has the highest rating. It will lose the first match but can win up to one more match if swapped optimally.

#### Test Case 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the cow is in a position to win multiple matches without needing a swap.

**Input**:
```
3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Cow 5 starts in position 5 with a rating of 12. By swapping with a cow with a lower rating, it can potentially win up to two matches.

#### Test Case 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the cow is in a position where it cannot win any matches even with a swap.

**Input**:
```
3
2 2
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Cow 2 starts in position 2 with the lowest rating. No matter what, it will lose the first match and cannot win any matches.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test Case 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large number of cows efficiently.

**Input**:
```
3
100000 1
1 2 3 4 5 ... 99999 100000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Cow 1 starts with the highest rating and will lose the first match. No swap can help it win any matches.

#### Test Case 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a small number of cows efficiently.

**Input**:
```
3
3 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Cow 3 starts in position 3 with the lowest rating. It will lose the first match and cannot win any matches.

#### Test Case 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is optimal but needs a swap to maintain its position.

**Input**:
```
3
5 2
10 5 15 20 25
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Cow 2 starts in position 2 with a rating of 5. Swapping with a cow in position 1 (rating 10) allows it to win the first match and then proceed to win the second match.

#### Test Case 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is suboptimal and needs a swap to win.

**Input**:
```
3
5 3
20 15 10 5 25
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Cow 3 starts in position 3 with a rating of 10. Swapping with a cow in position 2 (rating 15) allows it to win the first match and then proceed to win the second match.

#### Test Case 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the cow's initial position is suboptimal and no swap helps.

**Input**:
```
3
5 4
20 15 10 5 25
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Cow 4 starts in position 4 with a rating of 5. Swapping with a cow in position 3 (rating 10) allows it to win the first match but it will lose the second match.
