# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
This is a basic test case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \). We need to color at least 2 cells such that 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The provided solution colors the top-left and bottom-right cells, satisfying the condition.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \). Coloring the top-left and bottom-right cells ensures that at least 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), we need to color all 6 cells since there are only 10 diagonals and coloring all cells will satisfy the condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: 
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \). Coloring 5 out of 6 cells will ensure that 9 diagonals have at least one colored cell. For example, coloring the top-left, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, and bottom-right cells satisfies the condition.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \), we can color 4 cells to satisfy the condition. One possible configuration is to color the top-left, middle-left, middle-center, and bottom-right cells.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: 
Here, \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \). Coloring 6 cells will ensure that at least 11 diagonals have at least one colored cell. One possible configuration is to color the top-left, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right cells.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), we need to color 2 cells since there are only 6 diagonals and coloring both cells will satisfy the condition.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 100000000 \) and \( k = 1 \), we only need to color 1 cell to satisfy the condition. Any diagonal will then have at least one colored cell.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
400000000
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 100000000 \) and \( k = 400000000 \), we need to color 400000000 cells because there are only 400000000 diagonals, and coloring all of them will satisfy the condition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 399999999
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 100000000 \) and \( k = 399999999 \), we need to color 100000000 cells to ensure that 399999999 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This is because the maximum number of diagonals is \( 4n - 2 \).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000001
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000
```
**Explanation**: 
For \( n = 100000000 \) and \( k = 400000001 \), we need to color 100000000 cells because \( k \) exceeds the total number of diagonals, so we must color all cells.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
3
2 3
3 4
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
4
```
**Explanation**: 
This test case checks multiple scenarios in a compact form. It verifies the solutions for \( n = 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \) with different values of \( k \).

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution handles various inputs correctly.
