# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with minimal values for n and k.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: For n = 2 and k = 2, the only possible subsequence that sums to 2 is the entire sequence itself. Therefore, we need a sequence that does not include 2, and the simplest such sequence is `[1]`.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with maximum values for n and k.
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: For n = 1000000 and k = 1000000, the only possible subsequence that sums to 1000000 is the entire sequence itself. Therefore, we need a sequence that does not include 1000000, and the simplest such sequence is `[1]`.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with n slightly larger than k.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
1 2 4
```
**Explanation**: For n = 5 and k = 3, we need to ensure no subsequence sums to 3, but every other integer between 1 and 5 has a subsequence that sums to it. A valid sequence could be `[1, 2, 4]`, since no subsequence sums to 3, but subsequences can sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 (1+2+4).

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with n slightly smaller than k.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: For n = 5 and k = 6, the only possible subsequence that sums to 6 is the entire sequence itself. Therefore, we need a sequence that does not include 6, and the simplest such sequence is `[1]`.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with n equal to k.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: For n = 3 and k = 3, the only possible subsequence that sums to 3 is the entire sequence itself. Therefore, we need a sequence that does not include 3, and the simplest such sequence is `[1]`.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with n and k both small.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Explanation**: For n = 4 and k = 2, we need to ensure no subsequence sums to 2, but every other integer between 1 and 4 has a subsequence that sums to it. A valid sequence could be `[1, 3]`, since no subsequence sums to 2, but subsequences can sum to 1, 3, and 4 (1+3).

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with n and k both large.
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: For n = 10 and k = 10, the only possible subsequence that sums to 10 is the entire sequence itself. Therefore, we need a sequence that does not include 10, and the simplest such sequence is `[1]`.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with n much larger than k.
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Explanation**: For n = 1000000 and k = 10, we need to ensure no subsequence sums to 10, but every other integer between 1 and 1000000 has a subsequence that sums to it. A valid sequence could be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, since no subsequence sums to 10, but subsequences can sum to 1 through 9 and 11 through 1000000.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with n and k both equal.
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: For n = 10 and k = 10, the only possible subsequence that sums to 10 is the entire sequence itself. Therefore, we need a sequence that does not include 10, and the simplest such sequence is `[1]`.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the edge functionality with n equal to 25.
**Input**: 
```
1
25 25
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
```
**Explanation**: For n = 25 and k = 25, we need to ensure no subsequence sums to 25, but every other integer between 1 and 25 has a subsequence that sums to it. A valid sequence could be `[1, 2, 3, ..., 25]`, since no subsequence sums to 25, but subsequences can sum to 1 through 24.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the edge functionality with k equal to 1.
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Explanation**: For n = 10 and k = 1, we need to ensure no subsequence sums to 1, but every other integer between 1 and 10 has a subsequence that sums to it. A valid sequence could be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, since no subsequence sums to 1, but subsequences can sum to 2 through 10.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the edge functionality with n equal to 2.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: For n = 2 and k = 2, the only possible subsequence that sums to 2 is the entire sequence itself. Therefore, we need a sequence that does not include 2, and the simplest such sequence is `[1]`.

# Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the edge functionality with n and k both equal to 2.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: For n = 2 and k = 2, the only possible subsequence that sums to 2 is the entire sequence itself. Therefore, we need a sequence that does not include 2, and the simplest such sequence is `[1]`.
