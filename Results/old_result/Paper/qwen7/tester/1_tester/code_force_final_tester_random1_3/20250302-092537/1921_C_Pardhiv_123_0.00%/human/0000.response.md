# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic scenario where the phone can handle all messages without needing to turn off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone's charge is 3. Sending a message at moment 3 consumes 3 units of charge, leaving the phone with 0 charge, which means it cannot send the message.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can handle all messages by turning off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 21 charge. By turning off and on at strategic moments, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can handle all messages but with minimal charge.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 charge. By turning off and on at appropriate times, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone runs out of charge before sending all messages.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1000000000 charge but loses 1000000000 charge per unit of time. Since the first message is sent at moment 1000000000, the phone will run out of charge before sending the message.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can handle all messages but with a high cost of turning off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 11 charge. Turning off and on consumes 6 units of charge each time. The cost of turning off and on at the right moments would exceed the available charge, making it impossible to send all messages.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can handle all messages but with a large number of messages.
**Input**: 
```
1
12 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1000000000 charge and loses 1000000000 charge per unit of time. Even though the messages are spread out, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone runs out of charge due to a large number of messages and frequent turning off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 11 charge. Each turn-off and turn-on consumes 6 units of charge, and the phone loses 9 units of charge per unit of time. The cost of turning off and on at the right moments would exceed the available charge, making it impossible to send all messages.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can handle all messages but with a very high charge consumption rate.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 10 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 11 charge. Each turn-off and turn-on consumes 6 units of charge, and the phone loses 10 units of charge per unit of time. The cost of turning off and on at the right moments would exceed the available charge, making it impossible to send all messages.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can handle all messages but with a very low initial charge.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 1 1
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1 charge. Each turn-off and turn-on consumes 1 unit of charge, and the phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time. The cost of turning off and on at the right moments would exceed the available charge, making it impossible to send all messages.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can handle all messages but with a very high charge consumption rate and a small initial charge.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 10 1
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1 charge. Each turn-off and turn-on consumes 1 unit of charge, and the phone loses 10 units of charge per unit of time. The cost of turning off and on at the right moments would exceed the available charge, making it impossible to send all messages.
