# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The input array is already sorted, and the optimal permutation is [2, 1]. Adding the permutation results in [3, 3], where the number 3 occurs twice.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The optimal permutation is [2, 3, 1, 4]. Adding the permutation results in [9, 4, 5, 5], where the number 5 occurs twice.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
103 102 104
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The input array is already in a state where the numbers are distinct, and no permutation can increase the frequency of any number. Thus, the maximum frequency remains 3.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 101 1 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The optimal permutation is [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]. Adding the permutation results in [3, 102, 2, 101, 6], where the number 101 and 102 both occur twice.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 10 100 1000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: No permutation can make more than one element the same. The maximum frequency remains 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The optimal permutation is [2, 1]. Adding the permutation results in [5, 4], where no number repeats.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 999999997 999999999
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The optimal permutation is [3, 1, 2]. Adding the permutation results in [1000000003, 999999998, 1000000001], where the numbers 1000000001 and 1000000003 both occur once.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, the array is already a permutation, and no permutation can increase the frequency. In the second test case, the array is already a permutation with all elements the same, and no permutation can change this.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
5
```
*Explanation*: Both arrays are permutations, and no permutation can increase the frequency beyond the current maximum frequency in the array.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The array is a permutation, and no permutation can increase the frequency of any number beyond 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The array contains only one unique element, and no permutation can change this.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The array is already a permutation with all elements the same, and no permutation can change this.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The optimal permutation is [1, 3, 2, 4]. Adding the permutation results in [2, 3, 4, 3], where the number 3 occurs twice.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The array is a permutation, and no permutation can increase the frequency of any number beyond 1.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The array is a permutation, and no permutation can increase the frequency of any number beyond 1.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The optimal permutation is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]. Adding the permutation results in [2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8, 5], where the number 4 and 6 both occur three times.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: The optimal permutation is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]. Adding the permutation results in [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 3, 5, 7, 9, 4], where the number 4 occurs four times.
