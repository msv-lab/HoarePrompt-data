```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 2x2 grid, we need to color 2 cells such that 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the top-left and bottom-right cells.

# Test 8

```
2
3 1
3 14
```
**Output**: 
```
1
6
```
**Explanation**: In a 3x3 grid, we need to color 1 cell such that 1 diagonal has at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring any single cell. For the second case, we need to color 6 cells such that 14 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring all cells except one.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
5 8
5 20
```
**Output**: 
```
4
10
```
**Explanation**: In a 5x5 grid, we need to color 4 cells such that 8 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the top-left, top-middle, top-right, and middle-left cells. For the second case, we need to color 10 cells such that 20 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring all cells except the bottom-right cell.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
10 10
10 38
```
**Output**: 
```
10
20
```
**Explanation**: In a 10x10 grid, we need to color 10 cells such that 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the top-left, top-middle, ..., top-right cells. For the second case, we need to color 20 cells such that 38 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring the top-left, top-middle, ..., bottom-right cells.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 40000000
```
**Output**: 
```
40000000
```
**Explanation**: In a 100000000x100000000 grid, we need to color 40000000 cells such that 40000000 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring every other row or column starting from the first one.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
400000000
```
**Explanation**: In a 100000000x100000000 grid, we need to color 400000000 cells such that 400000000 diagonals have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring every cell in the grid.
