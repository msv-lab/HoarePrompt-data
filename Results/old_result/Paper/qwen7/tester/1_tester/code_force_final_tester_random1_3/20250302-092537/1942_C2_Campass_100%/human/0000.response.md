To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple polygon with a small number of sides and a few chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of chosen vertices is close to the total number of sides.

**Input**:
```
1
10 8 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of additional vertices to choose is limited.

**Input**:
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is at its minimum (4).

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of chosen vertices is at its minimum (2).

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of additional vertices to choose is zero.

**Input**:
```
1
5 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is at its maximum and the number of chosen vertices is also at its maximum.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 200000 200000
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
199998
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is at its maximum and the number of chosen vertices is just below the maximum limit.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 199999 1
1 2 3 ... 199999
```
**Output**:
```
199998
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is at its maximum and the number of additional vertices to choose is at its maximum.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 999998
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
999998
```
