# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this basic scenario, there is one '1', one '2', and one '3' in the sequence. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`, which means Bob wins initially. Eve can remove any one of these numbers to ensure Alice does not win in the next round. Thus, Bob wins once.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Here, there is one '1', one '3', and two '4's. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is `1 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 1`, which means Alice wins initially. Eve can remove one '1' to make the XOR zero, ensuring Bob wins. Thus, Bob wins once.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With two '1's, two '2's, and two '3's, the initial XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 0`. Bob wins initially. Eve can remove any two numbers that contribute to the XOR being zero, ensuring Bob wins in subsequent rounds. Thus, Bob wins three times.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: There are three '1's, three '2's, and two '3's. The initial XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 0`. Bob wins initially. Eve can strategically remove numbers to ensure Bob wins in subsequent rounds. Thus, Bob wins three times.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: With nine '2's, nine '3's, and no '1's or '4's, the initial XOR is `2 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ 2 (9 times) ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ ... ^ 3 (9 times) = 0`. Bob wins initially. Eve can remove all '2's and '3's in pairs, ensuring Bob wins in every round. Thus, Bob wins twelve times.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One '1' and one '2'. Initial XOR is `1 ^ 2 = 3`, which means Alice wins initially. Eve can remove one '1' to make the XOR zero, ensuring Bob wins. Thus, Bob wins once.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One '3' and one '4'. Initial XOR is `3 ^ 4 = 7`, which means Alice wins initially. Eve can remove one '3' to make the XOR zero, ensuring Bob wins. Thus, Bob wins once.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Only one '4'. Initial XOR is `4`, which means Alice wins initially. Eve cannot change this, so Bob wins zero times.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Two hundred '1's. Initial XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ ... ^ 1 (200 times) = 0`, which means Bob wins initially. Eve can remove one '1' to make the XOR non-zero, ensuring Alice wins. Thus, Bob wins once.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 200 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Two hundred '2's. Initial XOR is `2 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ 2 (200 times) = 0`, which means Bob wins initially. Eve can remove one '2' to make the XOR non-zero, ensuring Alice wins. Thus, Bob wins once.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 200 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Two hundred '3's. Initial XOR is `3 ^ 3 ^ ... ^ 3 (200 times) = 0`, which means Bob wins initially. Eve can remove one '3' to make the XOR non-zero, ensuring Alice wins. Thus, Bob wins once.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 200
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Two hundred '4's. Initial XOR is `4 ^ 4 ^ ... ^ 4 (200 times) = 0`, which means Bob wins initially. Eve can remove one '4' to make the XOR non-zero, ensuring Alice wins. Thus, Bob wins once.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1 1 0
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: Two identical sequences where each has one '1', one '2', and one '3'. The initial XOR is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0` in both cases, meaning Bob wins initially. Thus, Bob wins once in each case.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 2
0 0 0 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
```
**Explanation**: Three sequences with only '4's. The initial XOR is `4`, which means Alice wins initially. Thus, Bob wins zero times in each case.
