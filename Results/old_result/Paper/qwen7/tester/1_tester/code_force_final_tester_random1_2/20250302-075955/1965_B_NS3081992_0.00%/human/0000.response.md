# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \).
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: The only possible subsequence that sums to 2 is the entire sequence itself, which is not allowed. Hence, a sequence of size 1 with a single element 1 satisfies the condition.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 1, and subsequences of sizes 1 through 5 can sum to 2 through 6 respectively.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 8 \).
**Input**: 
```
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 8, and subsequences of sizes 1 through 7 can sum to 1 through 7 respectively.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 9 \) and \( k = 3 \).
**Input**: 
```
9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 3, and subsequences of sizes 1 through 4 can sum to 1, 2, 4, and 7 respectively.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 7 \).
**Input**: 
```
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 7, and subsequences of sizes 1 through 4 can sum to 1, 2, 3, and 8 respectively.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: The only possible subsequence that sums to 1 is the entire sequence itself, which is not allowed. Hence, a sequence of size 1 with a single element 1 satisfies the condition.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 25 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
25 1
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 1, and subsequences of sizes 1 through 25 can sum to 1 through 25 respectively.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 10^6 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 1, and subsequences of sizes 1 through 25 can sum to 1 through 25 respectively. Since \( n \) is very large, we use the smallest possible sequence to ensure the sum constraint is met.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 25 \) and \( k = 25 \).
**Input**: 
```
25 25
```
**Output**: 
```
24
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 25, and subsequences of sizes 1 through 24 can sum to 1 through 24 respectively.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 25 \) and \( k = 24 \).
**Input**: 
```
25 24
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 24, and subsequences of sizes 1 through 25 can sum to 1 through 25 respectively.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the function behaves as expected across a wide range of inputs.
