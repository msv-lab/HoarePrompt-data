# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with minimal messages and sufficient initial charge.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, leaving the phone with 0 charge. Therefore, it is not possible to send the message.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with minimal messages and insufficient initial charge.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 2 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, leaving the phone with -1 charge. Therefore, it is not possible to send the message.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with multiple messages and sufficient initial charge.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 5
4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. It can send the first message at moment 4, consuming 4 units of charge, and then send the second message at moment 6, consuming another 2 units of charge. The phone will have 4 units of charge left after sending the second message, which is sufficient.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with multiple messages and insufficient initial charge but enough to turn off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5 1 5
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 5 units of charge. It can send the first message at moment 1, consuming 1 unit of charge, and then turn off and on at moment 1. After turning off and on, it consumes 5 units of charge, bringing the total charge used to 6 units. The phone will have -1 charge after sending the first message, but it can turn off and on to regain 5 units of charge. It can then send the second message at moment 2, consuming 1 more unit of charge, and the third message at moment 3, consuming 1 more unit of charge. The phone will have 0 charge left after sending the third message, which is sufficient.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with multiple messages and insufficient initial charge but not enough to turn off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4 1 5
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 4 units of charge. It can send the first message at moment 1, consuming 1 unit of charge, and then turn off and on at moment 1. After turning off and on, it consumes 5 units of charge, bringing the total charge used to 6 units. The phone will have -2 charge after sending the first message, which is not possible.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with a large number of messages and sufficient initial charge.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 20 1 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 20 units of charge. It can send the first message at moment 1, consuming 1 unit of charge, and then send the remaining messages at subsequent moments, consuming 1 unit of charge each time. The phone will have 15 units of charge left after sending the fifth message, which is sufficient.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with a large number of messages and insufficient initial charge but enough to turn off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 15 1 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 15 units of charge. It can send the first message at moment 1, consuming 1 unit of charge, and then turn off and on at moment 1. After turning off and on, it consumes 5 units of charge, bringing the total charge used to 6 units. The phone will have 10 units of charge left after sending the first message, which is sufficient to send the remaining messages.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with a large number of messages and insufficient initial charge but not enough to turn off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. It can send the first message at moment 1, consuming 1 unit of charge, and then turn off and on at moment 1. After turning off and on, it consumes 5 units of charge, bringing the total charge used to 6 units. The phone will have 5 units of charge left after sending the first message, which is not sufficient to send the remaining messages.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with a single message and insufficient initial charge but enough to turn off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1 5
10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. It can send the message at moment 10, consuming 10 units of charge. The phone can turn off and on at moment 0, consuming 5 units of charge, and then send the message at moment 10, consuming no additional charge since the phone is already off.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with a single message and insufficient initial charge but not enough to turn off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5 1 5
10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 5 units of charge. It cannot send the message at moment 10 because it will run out of charge before reaching that moment.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with a large number of messages and a very high charge consumption rate.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 10 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Each unit of time consumes 10 units of charge, making it impossible to send any messages even if the phone is turned off and on.

# Test 12

**Input**: 
```
1
5 50 10 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 50 units of charge. Each unit of time consumes 10 units of charge, but the phone can turn off and on at moment 0, consuming 5 units of charge, and then send the messages at subsequent moments, consuming 10 units of charge each time. The phone will have 45 units of charge left after sending the fifth message, which is sufficient.

# Test 13
