# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Comment**: All numbers have different combinations of the last 31 bits, so each number must be in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comment**: The first number is `0` (binary: `00000000000000000000000000000000`) and the second number is `2147483647` (binary: `11111111111111111111111111111111`). They differ in every bit position, so they can be in the same group.

**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Comment**: The numbers have different combinations of the last 31 bits, but not all pairs are mutually exclusive. The minimum number of groups required is 3.

0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Comment**: Two zeros and two maximum values. The zeros can share a group, and the maximum values can share another group.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```

0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Comment**: Similar to Test 7, but with one less instance of the maximum value. The zeros can share a group, and the maximum value can be in another group.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Comment**: There are multiple instances of the same numbers. The unique combinations of the last 31 bits determine the minimum number of groups needed.
