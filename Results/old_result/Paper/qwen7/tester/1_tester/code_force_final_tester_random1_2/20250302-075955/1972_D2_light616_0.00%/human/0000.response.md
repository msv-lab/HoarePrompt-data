To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### 1. Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No pairs (a, b) exist where \(1 \le a \le 1\) and \(1 \le b \le 1\) such that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only pair that satisfies the condition is (2, 3) because \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 3 = 5\).

#### Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3 5
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only pair that satisfies the condition is (3, 5) because \(5 \cdot \gcd(3, 5) = 5 \cdot 1 = 5\) which is a multiple of \(3 + 5 = 8\).

#### Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
10 8
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The pairs that satisfy the condition are (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3), (6, 6), and (8, 8).

### 2. Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**:
```
423
```
**Explanation**: This is provided in the example output.

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**:
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This is provided in the example output.

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 2000000
```
**Output**:
```
1000000
```
**Explanation**: For each \(a\) from 1 to 1, there is exactly one \(b\) (which is \(a\)) that satisfies the condition, making the count \(1\).

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1000000
```
**Explanation**: For each \(b\) from 1 to 1, there is exactly one \(a\) (which is \(b\)) that satisfies the condition, making the count \(1\).

#### Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2000000 2000000
```
**Output**:
```
2000000
```
**Explanation**: For each \(a\) from 1 to 2000000, there is exactly one \(b\) (which is \(a\)) that satisfies the condition, making the count \(2000000\).

#### Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only pair that satisfies the condition is (2, 2) because \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 2 = 4\).

#### Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only pair that satisfies the condition is (1, 1) because \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\) which is a multiple of \(1 + 1 = 2\).

#### Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only pair that satisfies the condition is (1, 1) because \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\) which is a multiple of \(1 + 1 = 2\).

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
