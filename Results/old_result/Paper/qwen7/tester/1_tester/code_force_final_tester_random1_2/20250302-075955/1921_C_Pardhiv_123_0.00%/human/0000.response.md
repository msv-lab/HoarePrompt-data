# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with minimal input.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, leaving the phone with 0 charge, making it impossible to send the message.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with sufficient charge and no need to turn off.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 4 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 4 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 consumes 3 units of charge, leaving 1 unit of charge, which is still enough to send the message.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify basic functionality with multiple messages and some charge loss.
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10 1 2
1 5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. The charge loss is calculated as follows:
- Turn off at 0, turn on at 1: 10 - 2 = 8
- Send message at 1: 8 - 1 = 7
- Turn off at 1, turn on at 5: 7 - 2 = 5
- Send message at 5: 5 - 1 = 4
- Turn off at 5, turn on at 10: 4 - 2 = 2
- Send message at 10: 2 - 1 = 1

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone runs out of charge before the next message can be sent.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 5 1 2
3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 5 units of charge. The charge loss is calculated as follows:
- Turn off at 0, turn on at 3: 5 - 2 = 3
- Send message at 3: 3 - 1 = 2
- Turn off at 3, turn on at 6: 2 - 2 = 0
- No charge to send the next message at 6.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone needs to turn off and on frequently.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10 1 2
1 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. The charge loss is calculated as follows:
- Turn off at 0, turn on at 1: 10 - 2 = 8
- Send message at 1: 8 - 1 = 7
- Turn off at 1, turn on at 3: 7 - 2 = 5
- Send message at 3: 5 - 1 = 4
- Turn off at 3, turn on at 5: 4 - 2 = 2
- Send message at 5: 2 - 1 = 1
- Turn off at 5, turn on at 7: 1 - 2 = -1 (fails)

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a large initial charge but high consumption rate.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1 billion units of charge. However, the charge consumption rate is also 1 billion units per unit of time. Thus, the phone will run out of charge immediately.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a large initial charge and high consumption rate but can manage with frequent turning off and on.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1 2
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1 billion units of charge. The charge loss is calculated as follows:
- Turn off at 0, turn on at 1: 1000000000 - 2 = 999999998
- Send message at 1: 999999998 - 1 = 999999997
- Turn off at 1, turn on at 1000000000: 999999997 - 2 = 999999995
- Send message at 1000000000: 999999995 - 1 = 999999994

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a small initial charge and high consumption rate.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 2 units of charge. The charge loss is calculated as follows:
- Send message at 1: 2 - 1 = 1
- No charge to send the next message at 1.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a small initial charge and low consumption rate.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 2 units of charge. The charge loss is calculated as follows:
- Turn off at 0, turn on at 1: 2 - 2 = 0
- Send message at 1: 0 - 1 = -1 (fails)
- However, since we can turn off and on, we can manage the charge loss effectively.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone has a large initial charge and high consumption rate but the messages are sent at very close intervals.
**Input**:
