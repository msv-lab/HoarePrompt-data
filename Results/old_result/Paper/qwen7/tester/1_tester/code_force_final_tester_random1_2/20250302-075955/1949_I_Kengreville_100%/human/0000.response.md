To ensure the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable, we will create comprehensive test cases covering both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### 1. Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a simple configuration where the disks are already tangent and the sum of radii can be reduced.

**Input**:
```
5
0 2 1
0 0 1
4 -3 4
11 0 3
11 5 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a configuration where the disks are not tangent and the sum of radii can be reduced.

**Input**:
```
3
0 0 2
3 0 2
6 0 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a configuration where the disks are tangent and the sum of radii can be reduced.

**Input**:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a configuration where the disks are tangent and the sum of radii can be reduced, but with different tangency points.

**Input**:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a configuration where the disks are tangent and the sum of radii can be reduced, but with a more complex setup.

**Input**:
```
5
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 2
4 0 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

### 2. Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum number of disks (n=1).

**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of disks (n=1000).

**Input**:
```
1000
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
...
999 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a configuration where no disks are tangent.

**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
1 1 1
2 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a configuration where the sum of radii cannot be reduced.

**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a configuration where the disks are tangent but the sum of radii cannot be reduced.

**Input**:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a configuration where the disks are tangent and the sum of radii can be reduced, but the reduction would make them overlap.

**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a configuration where the disks are tangent and the sum of radii can be reduced, but the reduction would make them overlap in a way that violates the tangency condition.

**Input**:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a configuration where the disks are tangent and the sum of radii can be reduced, but the reduction would make them overlap in a way that violates the tangency condition.

**Input**:
```
5
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 2
4 0 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is thoroughly tested and robust.
