# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
**Output**: 
```
36
```
**Explanation**: This is the example provided in the problem statement. It tests the basic functionality with a typical set of inputs.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where all signs occur at consecutive years. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60, but since we are only considering sequential occurrences, the answer is 5.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where all signs occur every year. The LCM of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 is 1, but since we are considering sequential occurrences, the answer is 5 because the first sign occurs in the 1st year, and the last sign occurs in the 5th year.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```
**Output**: 
```
2012
```
**Explanation**: This is another example provided in the problem statement. It tests the function with larger numbers.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario with a single sign that occurs every 1,000,000 years. The answer is simply the periodicity of the sign.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 4 8
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the signs have powers of 2 as their periodicities. The LCM of 2, 4, and 8 is 8.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
105
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the signs have prime numbers as their periodicities. The LCM of 1, 3, 5, and 7 is 105.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where two signs have the same periodicity. The answer is the periodicity of either sign.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where one sign has a very large periodicity compared to the others. The answer is the largest periodicity.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2520
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario with the first 10 positive integers as periodicities. The LCM of these numbers is 2520.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario with a single sign that occurs every year. The answer is 1.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where all signs have the same very large periodicity. The answer is the periodicity of any of the signs.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
27720
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the periodicities include an additional prime number. The LCM of these numbers is 27720.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario with the maximum possible periodicity value. The answer is the periodicity of the sign.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where all signs have the same small periodicity. The answer is 1 because the first sign occurs in the 1st year, and the last sign also occurs in the 1st year.
