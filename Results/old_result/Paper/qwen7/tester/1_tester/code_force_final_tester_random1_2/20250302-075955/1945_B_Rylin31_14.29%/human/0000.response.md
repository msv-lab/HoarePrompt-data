# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
*Explanation*: Both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 1000000000000000001 minutes. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2000000000000000002, as explained in the example.

# Test 7

```
1
10 11 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 10 minutes, and the second installation every 11 minutes. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2, as the least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 11 is 110, and each firework is visible for 2 minutes.

# Test 8

```
1
100 101 10
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 100 minutes, and the second installation every 101 minutes. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 11, as the LCM of 100 and 101 is 10100, and each firework is visible for 11 minutes.
