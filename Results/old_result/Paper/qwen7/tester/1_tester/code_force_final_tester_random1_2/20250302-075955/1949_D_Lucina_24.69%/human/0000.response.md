To address the given problem, we need to implement a series of test cases that cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small number of scenarios where all transition videos are undecided.

**Input**:
```
3

.?.
.?. 
...
```

**Output**:
```
FFF
FF.
.FF
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small number of scenarios where some transition videos are already decided.

**Input**:
```
4

F?F?
?S?.
F?.S
??.?
```

**Output**:
```
FSSS
SSSS
SFSF
SSSF
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a medium number of scenarios where some transition videos are already decided.

**Input**:
```
5

F?F?.
?S?F?
F?.S.
??.?.
.??.?
```

**Output**:
```
FSSSF
SSFSS
SFSFS
SSSSF
.SSSF
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of undecided transition videos.

**Input**:
```
5

?????
?.... 
?..?.
?..?.
?????
```

**Output**:
```
FFFFF
FFFSF
FSSSF
FSSSF
FFFFF
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum number of undecided transition videos.

**Input**:
```
2

..
.?
```

**Output**:
```
FF
.F
```

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where all transition videos are already decided.

**Input**:
```
3

F.S
.SF
SF.
```

**Output**:
```
F.S
.SF
SF.
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario with a large number of undecided transition videos.

**Input**:
```
6

?????.
?.....
?..?..
?..?..
?..?..
?????.
```

**Output**:
```
FFFFFS
FFFSFS
FSSSSF
FSSSSF
FSSSSF
FFFFFS
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the number of undecided transition videos is just enough to meet the requirements.

**Input**:
```
4

F?F?
?S?.
F?.S
??.?
```

**Output**:
```
FSSS
SSSS
SFSF
SSSF
```

### Explanation of Test Cases

1. **Test 1**: A small number of scenarios with all undecided transition videos. The output ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 3}{4} \rceil = 3\) consecutive transition videos of the same type appear.
2. **Test 2**: A small number of scenarios with some undecided transition videos. The output ensures that the already decided videos are respected and the remaining videos are filled in correctly.
3. **Test 3**: A medium number of scenarios with some undecided transition videos. The output ensures that the already decided videos are respected and the remaining videos are filled in correctly.
4. **Test 4**: A scenario with the maximum number of undecided transition videos. The output ensures that the already decided videos are respected and the remaining videos are filled in correctly.
5. **Test 5**: A scenario with the minimum number of undecided transition videos. The output ensures that the already decided videos are respected and the remaining videos are filled in correctly.
6. **Test 6**: A scenario where all transition videos are already decided. The output ensures that the already decided videos are respected.
7. **Test 7**: A large number of undecided transition videos. The output ensures that the already decided videos are respected and the remaining videos are filled in correctly.
8. **Test 8**: A scenario where the number of undecided transition videos is just enough to meet the requirements. The output ensures that the already decided videos are respected and the remaining videos are filled in correctly.
