To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small polygon and a few chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, 4 chosen vertices, and 2 additional vertices available, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 6.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a medium-sized polygon and a moderate number of chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: With 7 sides, 3 chosen vertices, and 1 additional vertex available, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 5.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a large polygon and a high number of chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 500000 1000000000
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
499998
```
**Explanation**: With a very large polygon and many chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is \(n - x - 1\) when \(y\) is large enough.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum number of sides.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides and 2 chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 1.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with the maximum number of sides and minimal chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 1000000000
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
999999998
```
**Explanation**: With a very large polygon and only 2 chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is \(n - 2 - 1\).

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with the maximum number of sides and zero additional vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With a very large polygon and only 2 chosen vertices, and no additional vertices available, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 1.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with the maximum number of sides and the maximum number of additional vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 999999998
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
999999998
```
**Explanation**: With a very large polygon and only 2 chosen vertices, and the maximum number of additional vertices available, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is \(n - 2 - 1\).

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum number of sides and the maximum number of chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
4 3 0
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides and 3 chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 1.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum number of sides and the minimum number of chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides and 2 chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 1.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum number of sides and the maximum number of chosen vertices and additional vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
4 3 1
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, 3 chosen vertices, and 1 additional vertex available, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is 2.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
