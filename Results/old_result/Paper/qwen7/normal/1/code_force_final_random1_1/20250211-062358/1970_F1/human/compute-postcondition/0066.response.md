Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `ind`.
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(line))`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `ind` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`.
   - `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive.
   - `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`.
   - `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`.
   - `ind` is less than `len(line)`.
   - The current value of `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.
   - `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, otherwise `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind)`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1.
   - The condition `line[ind][1] == 'G'` is checked. If true, `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind)`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `ind` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `ind` will be `ind + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `ind + 1` must be less than `len(line)`.
   - The value of `line[ind + 1]` should not be `'..'`.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` should be evaluated.
   - Depending on the result of `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])`, `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` will be set to `False` or `goal[tmp]` will be updated to contain `(i, ind + 1)`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `ind` will be `ind + 1`.
   - `elements[line[ind]]` will be set to `(i, ind + 1)`.
   - `line` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive.
   - `grid` remains unchanged.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` will be evaluated.
   - `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` will be set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is `True`, otherwise `goal[tmp]` will be updated to contain `(i, ind + 1)`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind + 1)`, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind + 1]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind + 1]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind + 1)` for each non-`.` character in `line`, and `ind + 1` is less than `len(line)`, and the current value of `line[ind + 1]` is not `'..'`, and `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is `True`, otherwise `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind + 1)`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind + 1]` is 'B' else 1, and the condition `line[ind + 1][1] == 'G'` is checked. If true, `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind + 1)`**.
