Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined values within its scope. It returns a specific value based on the conditions applied to the list `a` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 18, and each element `a_i` in the list is an integer between 0 and 10^7.**
