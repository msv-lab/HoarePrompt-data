Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string obtained by joining the input string after splitting it on spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, if '1' is not found, `x` is -1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the index of the first occurrence of the substring '1' in the string `arr` to the variable `x`. If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` will be assigned the value -1. The conditions and values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
