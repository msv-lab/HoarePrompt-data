Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the percentage of satisfied residents on each side of the road. Specifically, the program uses `zero_perc` and `one_perc` to check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. However, these calculations are incorrect because they do not account for the total number of residents on each side.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
010111
```
The program should find that laying the road after the third house (index 2) is optimal. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the percentages and fails to identify this as the correct position.

The correct approach should be to count the number of zeros and ones up to each position and ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. The program should also correctly handle the edge cases where the road can be laid before the first house or after the last house.
