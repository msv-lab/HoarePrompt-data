Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `input()` to the list `gr`. Since the input is not specified, we represent it as the input from the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
