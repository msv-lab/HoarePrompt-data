Based on the initial state provided:

- `nx` is a string composed of 'S' and 'F' based on certain conditions, but no specific conditions are given for how `nx` is formed.
- `j` is defined as `n + 1`, where `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but since `nx` is mentioned, it's reasonable to assume `n` refers to the length of `nx`.

Given this, `nx` could be any string consisting of 'S' and 'F', and `j` would be one more than the length of `nx`.

Since the exact content of `nx` is not specified, the output will depend on the actual value of `nx`.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string composed of 'S' and 'F')**
