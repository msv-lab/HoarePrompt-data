Output State: `ad` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from index 1 to the last index, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`.

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and continues until `i` is less than the length of `a`. In each iteration, it appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` to `ad`. Since the loop runs for as many times as there are elements in `a` starting from index 1, `ad` will end up containing the differences between all consecutive pairs of elements in `a`. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, indicating that all elements in `a` have been processed.
