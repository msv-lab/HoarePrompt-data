Output State: The list `smin` is updated such that for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `smin[i]` is the minimum value between `smin[i-1]` (or `smin[0]` if `i` is 0) and `suf[i+1]`. This means `smin` retains the smallest suffix sum encountered up to each index `i`.

In simpler terms, `smin` contains the minimum suffix sums from each position `i` to the end of the list `l`.
