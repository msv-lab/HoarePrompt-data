Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, where `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the next element in the list `lst` (`ele`). The initial state's condition about `mini` being updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - next_element)` remains true, just with `next_element` renamed to `ele` for clarity. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.
