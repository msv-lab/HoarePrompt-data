Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ind` is 1
- `elements[line[1]]` is `False, 1`
- If `isPlayer(line[1])` evaluates to `False`, then `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`
- Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` equals 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1
- `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, 1)`

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for ind in range(len(line)):
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The only variable in the loop head is `ind`.

### Adjusting the State
- Since `ind` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `ind` will be `2`.
- The other variables (`elements`, `line`, `isPlayer`, `allPlayers`, `tmp`, and `goal`) are not directly affected by the loop head and remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
Given that `ind` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `ind` will be 2.

State: **`ind` is 2, `elements[line[1]]` is `False, 1`, if `isPlayer(line[1])` evaluates to `False`, then `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` equals 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, 1)`**
