Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each index in the list `line`. The loop will continue as long as `ind` is within the bounds of `line`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[ind]` at the end of each iteration.
   - `line` remains unchanged unless modified inside the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, we assume it stays the same.
   - `i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[ind]]` at the end of each iteration.
   - `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive and does not change within the loop.
   - `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, and it does not change within the loop.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` and does not change within the loop.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G' and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[ind]` at the end of each iteration, we need to set `ind` to this new value.
   - `i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[ind]]`, so we need to add this increment to the current value of `i`.
   - `n`, `line`, `grid`, `isPlayer(line[ind])`, and the `goal` list remain unchanged.

Given that the loop will continue as long as `ind` is within the bounds of `line`, and considering the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `ind` is valid for the next iteration.

Assuming the current value of `ind` is `len(line) - 1` (the last index), the next value of `ind` would be `line[len(line) - 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`.
- `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[len(line) - 1]`.

Since `n` and other variables remain unchanged, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`, `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[len(line) - 1]`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G' and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal`.**
