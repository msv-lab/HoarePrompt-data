You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

#Function 3:
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)

#Function 4:
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function processes a list `a` of integers and prints the sum and maximum value of the list. It also generates and prints a series of index pairs `(l, r)` that represent operations performed on the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value; instead, it modifies and prints the output based on the input list `a`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an array `a` of integers.
   - We can perform operations where we choose a subarray from `a[l]` to `a[r]` and set all elements in this subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function seems to be incorrectly named and its purpose is unclear from the provided code. It appears to be trying to set the elements in a subarray to a specific value but is not correctly implemented.
   - Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to recursively set elements to the MEX value, but it does not handle the MEX calculation properly and has a logical error in its base case.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is intended to maximize the sum of the array `a`.
   - It calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but does not pass the `ops` list, making it difficult to track the operations performed.
   - The function returns the sum of the array and the number of operations, but it does not seem to be correctly implementing the logic to maximize the sum.

4. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - It checks if the current sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\). If true, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to the MEX value.
   - However, the MEX calculation is missing, and the function does not correctly handle the recursive calls to maximize the sum.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - The issue lies in the implementation of `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, which do not correctly maximize the sum of the array.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array. The MEX calculation and the recursive approach are not correctly handled, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness

**Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.
