Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `mini` will hold the smallest value obtained from calculating `abs(pk - ele)` for every element `ele` in the list `lst`. This means `mini` is the minimum distance between `pk` and any index in `lst` that satisfied the conditions in the loop.
