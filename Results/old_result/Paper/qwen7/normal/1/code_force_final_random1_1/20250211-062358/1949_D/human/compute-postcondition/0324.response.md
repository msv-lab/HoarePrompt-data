Output State: **`nx` is either 'Sxx[i][0]' or 'Fxx[i][0]', `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. Since `j` was incremented before this line, `j - 1` refers to the previous value of `j`. Given that `nx` was either 'S' or 'F', it now becomes either 'S' concatenated with `xx[i][0]` or 'F' concatenated with `xx[i][0]`, depending on its original value. The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the exact value is not specified, only that it is `j + 1`.
