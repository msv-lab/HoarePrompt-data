To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the formulae step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is defined as `len(a) - a[s - 1]`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is `bisect_left(a, q)`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `q`: This is the length of the list `a` minus the element at index `s-1` of `a`.
   - `l`: This is explicitly given as 0.
   - `m`: This is a combination of several variables: `b[s - 1]` (the element at index `s-1` of `b`), `bd[s]` (an element from `bd` list at index `s`), `ql` (which is `q * l`), and `ad[s]` (an element from `ad` list at index `s`). Since `l` is 0, `ql` will be 0, making `m` equal to `b[s - 1]`.
   - `i`: This is explicitly given as 1, but it is not used in the calculation of `m`.
   - `s`: This is the index where `q` would be inserted into the sorted list `a` to maintain the sorted order. It is determined by `bisect_left(a, q)`.

3. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - Given `l = 0`, the term `ql` becomes `0`, so `m` simplifies to `b[s - 1]`.

4. **Printing `int(m)`**:
   - Since `m` is `b[s - 1]`, and we need to print the integer value of `m`, the output will be the integer value of `b[s - 1]`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of the element at index `s-1` of the list `b`.

Output: **int(b[s - 1])**
