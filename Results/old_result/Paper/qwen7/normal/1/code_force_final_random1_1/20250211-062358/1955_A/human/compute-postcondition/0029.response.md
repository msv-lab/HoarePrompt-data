Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can take any integer value between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, but its specific value does not affect the calculation of `X` and the final printed output.
- `i` is 2.
- `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value.
- `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value.
- `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`. Let's break it down:

1. `X = A // 2`: This is the integer division of `A` by 2.
2. `X * C`: This multiplies the result of the integer division by `C`.
3. `X * C + B`: This adds `B` to the result of the previous multiplication.

Since the specific values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the expression `X * C + B`. However, we can describe the expression in terms of the variables involved.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
