Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` remains unchanged with the value of `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

In this case, the code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables (`ss`, `s`, `cur_ss`, and `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
