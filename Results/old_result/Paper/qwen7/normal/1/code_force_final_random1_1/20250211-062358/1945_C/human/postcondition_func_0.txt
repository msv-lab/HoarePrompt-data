The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the percentage of '1's and '0's in the string and identifies positions in the string where both percentages reach or exceed 50%. It then finds the position closest to half the length of the string \( n \) and returns this position. If no such position exists, it returns either the start or end of the string based on the majority percentage of '1's or '0's.
