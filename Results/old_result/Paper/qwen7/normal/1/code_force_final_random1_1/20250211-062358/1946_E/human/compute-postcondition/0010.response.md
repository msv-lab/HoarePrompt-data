Output State: **a and b are positive integers where a >= b, and b is not equal to 0, and a is not divisible by b; c and d are the results of func_1(b, a % b)**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a % b`. Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a % b` will be a non-zero value less than `b`. The function `func_1` returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`. The initial conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
