The function accepts an integer `c` (where \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{\text{len}(l)}{2}\)) and a list `l` of integers. It swaps the elements at positions `c-1` and `-c` in the list `l`. After performing the swap, it returns the modified list `l`. If no swap is performed (i.e., when the conditions are not met), it still returns the original list `l` unchanged.
