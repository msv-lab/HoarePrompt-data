Output State: **`custos` must contain the total accumulated cost after all iterations have been executed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `custos` will contain a single integer representing the sum of all individual costs computed during each iteration of the loop. This total cost is the result of processing all provided sets of input values for `num_fila` and `max_p`, along with their corresponding lists `a_values` and `b_values`, according to the rules specified within the loop.
