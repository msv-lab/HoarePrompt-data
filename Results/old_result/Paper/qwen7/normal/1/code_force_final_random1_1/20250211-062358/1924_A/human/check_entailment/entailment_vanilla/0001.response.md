Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` and the string `s`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1()` is defined but never actually called within the main loop. This function is supposed to handle the logic for checking subsequences.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program uses a loop to process each test case.
   - It reads `n`, `k`, and `m` for each test case.
   - It reads the string `s` of length `m`.

4. **Processing String `s`:**
   - It creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of characters seen so far.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `us`, it adds it to `win`.
     - If `win` has `k` characters, it appends the character to `ans` and clears `win`.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `ps` (the count of unique characters processed) is at least `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` by appending a character not in `win` and padding with 'a' to make it of length `n`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Function Call Issue:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop. This means the actual logic for checking subsequences is not being executed.

2. **Logic for Checking Subsequences:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`. Instead, it checks if the first `k` characters of `s` are sufficient to form a sequence of length `n`.

3. **Incorrect Output Construction:**
   - The output construction logic assumes that the missing character is always the last one added to `ans`, which might not be correct.

### Corrected Program:
To fix these issues, we need to implement the logic for checking all possible strings of length `n` and ensure the correct output is generated.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []

    # Check if all possible strings of length n can be formed as subsequences
    for i in range(m):
        if s[i] in us:
            win.add(s[i])
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(s[i])
                if len(ans) == n:
                    break
                win.clear()

    if len(ans) == n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Generate a string of length n that cannot be a subsequence
        missing_char = ''.join([c for c in us if c not in ans[:n]])[0]
        print(missing_char * n)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical flaws and does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
