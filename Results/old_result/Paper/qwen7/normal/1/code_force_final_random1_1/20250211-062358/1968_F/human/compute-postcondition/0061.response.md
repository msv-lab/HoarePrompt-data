Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is either ['YES', 'YES'] or ['YES', 'NO'], `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v1, r)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(data[idx])` simply assigns the value of `data[idx]` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `idx` is increased by 2, but since the code does not explicitly show this, we assume it happens implicitly.
