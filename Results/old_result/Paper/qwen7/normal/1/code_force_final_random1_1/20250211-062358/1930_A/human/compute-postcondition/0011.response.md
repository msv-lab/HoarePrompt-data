Output State: The value of `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, up to the last element that satisfies the condition `i < 2 * n`. The variable `n` must be greater than 0.

In simpler terms, `score` will hold the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest index that does not exceed `2 * n - 2`.
