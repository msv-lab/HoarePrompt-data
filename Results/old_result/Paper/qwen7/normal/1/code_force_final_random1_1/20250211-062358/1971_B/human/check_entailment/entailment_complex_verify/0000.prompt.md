You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations. Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1 (since it starts as a positive integer and is decremented by 1 in each iteration), `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and is unchanged throughout the loop executions, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the last input string `s`. If the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of the unique characters in `a`, and `c` is a string containing these sorted unique characters in reverse order.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `t` will still be within the range 1 to 1000, as it was not modified by the loop. The variable `n` will be 0 or negative (depending on how many inputs were provided) since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `s` will hold the last input string processed, and `a` will contain the unique characters from this string. Depending on the condition of the set `a`, either `b` or `c` will be printed, representing the sorted and reverse-sorted versions of the unique characters, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints either the lexicographically sorted version or the reverse-sorted version of the unique characters in `s`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the string consists of exactly two distinct characters. For such cases, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because the set `a` will contain exactly two elements. However, according to the problem description, if no such string `r` exists (which means the string cannot be rearranged to be different from the original), the program should output "NO". 

For example, consider the input `aaaaa`. The program will output "NO", but according to the problem description, since the string can be rearranged to be different (e.g., "aaaaa" can be rearranged to "aaaba"), the correct output should be "YES" followed by a rearranged string like "aaaba".

Here is an example of a failing case:
- Input: `aaaaa`
- Expected Output: 
```
YES
aaaba
```
- Actual Output: 
```
NO
```
