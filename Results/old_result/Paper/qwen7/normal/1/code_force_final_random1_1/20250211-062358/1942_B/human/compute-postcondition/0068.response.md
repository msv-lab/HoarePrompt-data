Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `mex` remains unchanged.
   - `res` is a list where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`.
   - `ar` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `i` is `-1`, the loop that populates `res` would have completed its iterations.
   - For each index `i` in the range from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - Given that `i` is `-1`, `res` will contain the values computed during the loop execution.

4. **Determine `res`**:
   - Let's assume `ar` is a list with elements `[a0, a1, ..., an-1]` (where `n = len(ar)`).
   - During the loop, for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.

5. **Final `res`**:
   - Since `i` is `-1` after the loop, `res` contains the values `mex - ar[n-1]`, `mex - ar[n-2]`, ..., `mex - ar[0]`.

6. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `res` into a single string separated by spaces and converts each element to a string.

Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `res`.

Output: **mex - ar[n-1] mex - ar[n-2] ... mex - ar[0]**
