### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy the given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution involves calculating combinations and permutations based on the positions of these maximums.

2. **Key Components of the Solution:**
   - **Facts Array:** Precomputed factorials modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **Main Logic:**
     - Check if the first and last elements of the prefix and suffix maximums match the constraints.
     - Calculate the number of ways to arrange elements between and around the maximums using combinations.
     - Adjust the count based on the distances between the maximums.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - **Precomputation of Factorials:** The `facts` array is correctly precomputed up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - **Checking Constraints:** The code checks if the first and last elements of the prefix and suffix maximums match the required positions.
   - **Combination Calculation:** The `func_2` function uses the extended Euclidean algorithm (`func_1`) to compute modular inverses, which are used to calculate combinations.
   - **Permutation Calculation:** The code correctly calculates the number of valid permutations by considering the gaps between the maximums.

4. **Execution Summaries:**
   - The execution summaries indicate that the code handles the constraints and performs the necessary calculations accurately.
   - The logic for handling the gaps and the combination calculations aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed analysis and the execution summaries, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
