Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, `A` is now `[x] + A`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and `n`, `i`, and `x` are as per the initial state. The list `A` is updated by appending `x` to its end.
