Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It returns `l` which remains unchanged from its initial state, or it returns the result of calling `func_2(c, k, l)` with updated values of `c` and `k`, or it returns the value of `l` which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` with updated values of `c`, or it returns the value of `l` which is the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` with further updated values of `c` and `k`, or it returns the value of `l` which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` with updated values of `c`, or it returns the value of `l` which is the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` with further updated values of `c` and `k` if `k` equals 0.**

This means the function `func_1` takes two integers `n` and `k` as input. Depending on specific conditions, it either returns `l` unchanged or modifies `c` and `k` to call other functions (`func_2` or `func_3`) and returns their results.
