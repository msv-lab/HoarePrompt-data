Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, if the loop continues, `i` will become 2.

5. **Determine the new condition for `n`**: For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0. Since no information is given that would change this condition, `n` remains greater than 0.

6. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 2 (since it was 1 and the loop increments it by 1).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
