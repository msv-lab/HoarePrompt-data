Output State: **`i` is 5; `score` is the original `score` plus `l[5]`**.

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` is 5, `score` is updated to its original value plus the value of `l[5]`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 3 remains unchanged, and the value of `i` remains 5.
