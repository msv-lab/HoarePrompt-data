Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `bOnes = 0` initializes the variable `bOnes` to 0. The values of `t` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `aOnes` also remains unchanged as it was already initialized to 0.
