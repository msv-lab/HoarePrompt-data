To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `start` is the last index where `nums[start]` is greater than 0.
   - `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - start`.
   - `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - (start - 1)`.
   - ...
   - `nums[start-1]` is `nums[start-1] - 1`.
   - `vis` contains the elements from 0 to `start-1`.

2. **Operations**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are non-zero values in `nums` starting from `start`.
   - After each iteration, `start` is incremented.
   - If `nums[start + 1]` is not truthy (i.e., it is 0), the loop prints `start + 1` and returns, stopping further iterations.

Given this, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If `nums[start]` is the only non-zero value in the array, then `start` will be the index of that non-zero value. The loop will print `start + 1` because `nums[start + 1]` will be 0 (since `start + 1` is out of bounds or already zero).

- If there are multiple non-zero values, the loop will continue decrementing the values in `nums` until it finds an index where `nums[start + 1]` is 0. At that point, it will print `start + 1`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we need to consider the general case. The loop will stop when it encounters a zero, and it will print the index just before that zero.

Therefore, the output will be the index just before the first zero encountered in the array starting from `start`.

Output: **start + 1 (where start is the last index where nums[start] is greater than 0)**
