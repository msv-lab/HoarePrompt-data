Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The condition `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
