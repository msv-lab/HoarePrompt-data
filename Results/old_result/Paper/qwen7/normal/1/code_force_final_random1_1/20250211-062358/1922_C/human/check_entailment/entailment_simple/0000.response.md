### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities.
   - The cost to travel directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.
   - The cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin.
   - For each query, we need to compute the minimum cost to travel from city \( x \) to city \( y \).

2. **Analyze the Given Code:**
   - The code defines a function `func()` that processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities `l`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then processes each query to find the minimum cost to travel from city \( x \) to city \( y \).

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The code uses two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store the cumulative costs to reach the closest city.
   - `d1` is computed from left to right, and `d2` is computed from right to left.
   - For each query, the code correctly calculates the minimum cost using these dictionaries.

4. **Issues with the Code:**
   - The code does not handle the case where the closest city is not unique, but the problem statement guarantees that the closest city is unique.
   - The code does not handle the case where the closest city is the starting city itself, which should be considered in the calculations.
   - The code does not handle the case where the closest city is the ending city itself, which should also be considered in the calculations.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost in the dictionaries `d1` and `d2` seems correct.
   - However, the final calculation in the query processing part might not be accurate because it does not account for the possibility that the closest city could be the starting or ending city itself.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not fully address all edge cases and might produce incorrect results in certain scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Correctness:
**False**
