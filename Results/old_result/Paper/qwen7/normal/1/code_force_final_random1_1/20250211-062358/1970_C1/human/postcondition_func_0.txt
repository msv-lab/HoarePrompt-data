The function reads input values to construct a graph represented by adjacency lists and their reverses. It then checks two conditions involving traversals through the graph and prints 'Ron' if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value but outputs the result based on the graph traversal outcomes.
