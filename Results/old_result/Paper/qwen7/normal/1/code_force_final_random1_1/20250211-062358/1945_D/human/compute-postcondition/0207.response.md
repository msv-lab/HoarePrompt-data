Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `y`, `max_p`, and the lists `a_values` and `b_values`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `y`**: The loop starts with `y` set to `max_p - 1` and decrements `y` until it reaches `0`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `y` should be initialized to `max_p - 1`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `y` must be greater than or equal to `0` at the start of the loop.

4. **Understand the state of `custo`**: The value of `custo` is defined as the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`. This means that `custo` is already calculated based on the values of `a_values` and `b_values` up to `max_p - 1`.

5. **List the necessary adjustments**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `y` and `max_p` because they are used in the loop head. The value of `custo` is already determined and does not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `y` should be initialized to `max_p - 1`.
- `y` must be greater than or equal to `0` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`**.
