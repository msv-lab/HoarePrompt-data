Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial condition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `m` must still be greater than 0, while `a` and `b` are the integers obtained from the input.
