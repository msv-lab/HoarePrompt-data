Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and `final` is sorted; `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The code sets `pk` to `n / 2`. The values of `mini`, `final`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
