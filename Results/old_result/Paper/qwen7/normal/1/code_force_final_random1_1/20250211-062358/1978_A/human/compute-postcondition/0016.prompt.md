You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t ≤ 500, `_` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 500 (inclusive), but it will have been decremented to 0 by the end of the loop. The variable `_` will hold the value 3, indicating the last iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `n` is set to an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers derived from another input string split by spaces and converted to integers. The loop processes each of the `t` inputs in sequence, performing the specified operation on the last two elements of the list `nums` for each input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each test case, n is an integer between 2 and 100, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result based on the processed input data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
