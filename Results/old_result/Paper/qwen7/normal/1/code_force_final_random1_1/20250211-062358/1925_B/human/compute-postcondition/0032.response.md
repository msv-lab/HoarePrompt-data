Output State: The value of `ans` will be the maximum value it attains during any iteration of the loop where the conditions `x % i == 0` and either of the two conditions inside the loop body are satisfied. Specifically, these conditions are:

1. \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot i) \% i == 0 \)
2. \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \geq 0 \), \( x // i > 0 \), and \( (x - n \cdot (x // i)) \% (x // i) == 0 \)

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is the final value of `ans` that satisfies the above conditions for any valid `i` within the range \(1\) to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1\).

In simpler terms, `ans` will hold the largest value among all possible `i` values that meet the specified conditions during the loop's execution.
