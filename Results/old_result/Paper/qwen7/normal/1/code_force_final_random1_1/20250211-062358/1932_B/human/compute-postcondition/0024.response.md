Output State: The list `a` is empty, and `year` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because one element is processed in each iteration. The variable `year` is updated in each iteration by adding `year % ai or ai` for each element `ai` in the list `a`. This means `year` accumulates the value of each element in `a`, as `year % ai` will either be `ai` if `ai` divides `year` exactly or `0` otherwise, effectively just adding `ai` to `year` in each step. Thus, `year` ends up being the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.
