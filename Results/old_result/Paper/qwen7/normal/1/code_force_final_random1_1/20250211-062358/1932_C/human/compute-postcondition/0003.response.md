Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is given as a positive integer.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`). 

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial states:
- `b` is an empty list.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4].
- `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
