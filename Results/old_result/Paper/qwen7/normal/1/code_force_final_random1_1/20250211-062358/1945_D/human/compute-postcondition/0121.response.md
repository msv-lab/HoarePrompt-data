Postcondition: **`v` is -3, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, `best` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-3]` depending on which value is greater, and `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-3]` accordingly.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block. It ensures that regardless of the path taken (whether the condition `v <= pos_final` is true or false), the final state of the variables `v`, `na_frente`, `best`, and `total` adheres to the specified conditions.
