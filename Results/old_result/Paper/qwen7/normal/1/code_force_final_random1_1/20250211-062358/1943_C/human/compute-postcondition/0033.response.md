Output State: **`n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]; n` is `-1`**

Explanation: The code `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` assigns the value of `previous[-1]` to `n`. Since `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]`, `path_ba[-1]` refers to `-1`. Given that the initial state of `n` is `-1`, the assignment does not change the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
