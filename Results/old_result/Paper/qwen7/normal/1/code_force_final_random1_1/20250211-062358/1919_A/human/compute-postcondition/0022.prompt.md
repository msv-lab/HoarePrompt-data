Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `results` is a list containing 1000 elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. The variable `a` represents the first integer input for each iteration, `b` represents the second integer input for each iteration, and `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration and is the last element in the `results` list.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because the range function will stop once it reaches `t` (which starts at a value between 1 and 1000 and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0). The `results` list will contain 1000 elements, each being the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers input during the loop's iterations.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: 

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `result` is the second element in the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `result` is the third element in the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
