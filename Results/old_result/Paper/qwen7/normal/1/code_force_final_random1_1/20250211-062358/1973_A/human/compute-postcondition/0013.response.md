Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, `-1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Substituting `total_points` with `p1 + p2 + p3`, we get `egalites` as `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, which simplifies to `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`. All other variables remain unchanged.
