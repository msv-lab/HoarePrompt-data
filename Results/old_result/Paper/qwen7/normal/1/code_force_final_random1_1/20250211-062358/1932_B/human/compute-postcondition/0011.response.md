Output State: The list `a` is empty, `year` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, the list `a` will be empty because each element is processed once. The variable `year` accumulates the value of each element in `a` during each iteration. Specifically, for each `ai` in `a`, `year` is updated by adding `year % ai` or `ai` to itself. This means `year` ends up being the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
