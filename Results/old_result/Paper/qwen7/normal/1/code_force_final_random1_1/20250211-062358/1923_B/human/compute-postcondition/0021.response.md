Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, and `rest` is now `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` decreases the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` by `delta`. This affects only the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The other variables (`distance`, `pos`, `len(sorted_indices)`, and `rest`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
