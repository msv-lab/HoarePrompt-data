Postcondition: `tc` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is `j + 1`, `m` is greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is True. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is set to True, `m` is set to a value greater than 3, `ans` is set to 'NO', `i` is set to `n - 2`, and `n` is set to `j + 1`. If `gr[0][0]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then there is no change in the values of `tc`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `impossible`.
