Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `winner` (which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`) to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending, it contains one element, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `winner` remain unchanged from their initial states.
