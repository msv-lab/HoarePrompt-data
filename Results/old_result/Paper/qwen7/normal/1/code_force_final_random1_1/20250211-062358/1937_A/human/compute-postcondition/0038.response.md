Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 7, and `power` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`. From the given information, we can see that after 3 iterations, `power` is 6 and `n` must be greater than 5. Since the loop increments `power` by 1 each iteration, it will continue to do so until `power` is no longer less than `n`. Given that `n` must be greater than 5 initially and increases with each iteration, the loop will run until `power` reaches 8 (since `power` starts from 3 and needs to be incremented 5 more times to reach 8). At this point, `power` will no longer be less than `n`, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `power` will be 8, and `n` must be greater than 7.
