Output State: `a` is equal to the sum of all digits of `num`, `num` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `num` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues to divide `num` by 10 until it reaches 0. During each iteration, the digit of `num` that is being removed (by performing `num % 10`) is added to `a`. Therefore, `a` accumulates the sum of all digits of the original `num` until `num` is fully reduced to 0.
