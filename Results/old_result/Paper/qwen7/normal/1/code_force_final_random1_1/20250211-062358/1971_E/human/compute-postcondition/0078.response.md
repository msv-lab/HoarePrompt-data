Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b) + len(a) - 1`, `l` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the result of adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration from `0` to `len(a) - 1`, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration, `t` is reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is updated to `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is updated to `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is updated to `[0]`**

Explanation:
- `ad` is initialized to `[0]`.
- `a` and `b` are updated to `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means they are lists containing integers read from input, prepended with a `0`.
- All other variables (`i`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`) remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them in the given code snippet.
