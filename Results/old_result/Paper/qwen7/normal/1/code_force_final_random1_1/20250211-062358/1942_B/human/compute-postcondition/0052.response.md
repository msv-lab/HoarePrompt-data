Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`. The current value of `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Since `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, the index `i` remains unchanged. The value of `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, and the condition that `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]` still holds true. All other variables and their states remain the same as the initial state.
