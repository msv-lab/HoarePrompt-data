Output State: **`n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, -1]`, `ci` is 1, `c` is -1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `path_ba[ci]` to the variable `c`. Given that `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, -1]` and `ci` is 1, the value of `c` is `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
