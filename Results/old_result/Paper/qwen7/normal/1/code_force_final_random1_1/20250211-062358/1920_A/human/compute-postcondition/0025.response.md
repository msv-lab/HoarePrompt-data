Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` is 3; `v` is an integer from the input; `num` is a list containing the value of `v`.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` (which is an integer from the input) to the list `num`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `num` now containing the value of `v`.
