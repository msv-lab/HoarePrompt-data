Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads each test case from standard input, splitting the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The variable `b` is updated to include `c` by setting `b += c`.
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is used to calculate the number of tents needed:
     - `-b // 3` computes the integer division of `-b` by 3, which is equivalent to `(-b + 2) // 3` due to Python's floor division behavior.
     - The expression `a - -b // 3` calculates the number of tents needed for introverts and part of the extroverts and universals combined.
     - The condition `[c < b % 3]` checks if there are remaining universals that cannot form a complete tent with extroverts. If true, it prints `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `c < b % 3`, it means there are leftover universals who cannot form a complete tent with extroverts, leading to an impossible scenario where the output should be `-1`. The logic handles this correctly.
   - When `c >= b % 3`, the calculation `(a - -b // 3)` ensures that all participants are accommodated without any leftovers.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of tents for each test case or `-1` when it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

Given the analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
