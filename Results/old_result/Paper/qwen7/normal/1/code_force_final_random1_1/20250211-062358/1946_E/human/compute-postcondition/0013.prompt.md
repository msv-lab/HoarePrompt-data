You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a >= b.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0
    #State: a and b are positive integers where a >= b, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the second return value of func_1(b, a) and the first return value of func_1(b, a)
    #State: a and b are positive integers where a >= b, and b is not equal to 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)
    #State: a and b are positive integers where a >= b, and b is not equal to 0, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns d, which is the result of func_1(b, a % b), and c - a // b * d, where c and d are the results of func_1(b, a % b)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It returns either 1 and 0, the second return value and the first return value from a recursive call to `func_1(b, a)`, 1 and the result of `-(a // b - 1)`, or the results `d` and `c - a // b * d` from a recursive call to `func_1(b, a % b)` where `c` and `d` are the results of that same recursive call.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1 and 0

Case_2: The program returns the second return value of func_1(b, a) and the first return value of func_1(b, a)

Case_3: The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)

Case_4: The program returns d, which is the result of func_1(b, a % b), and c - a // b * d, where c and d are the results of func_1(b, a % b)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
