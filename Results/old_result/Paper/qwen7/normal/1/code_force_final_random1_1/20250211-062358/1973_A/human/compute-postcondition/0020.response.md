Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in the list `cas_de_test`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `cas_de_test`: This list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `p1`: This is the first value from the current inner list being processed.
   - `p2`: This is the second value from the current inner list being processed.
   - `p3`: This is the third value from the current inner list being processed.

4. **Calculate the new values**:
   - `total_points`: This is calculated as `p1 + p2 + p3` for the current iteration.
   - `total_matchs`: This is calculated as `total_points // 2`.
   - `egalites`: This is initially set to `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`. If `egalites` is less than 0, it remains as `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`. Otherwise, it is updated to `egalites // 2`.

5. **Prepare the state for the next iteration**:
   - After processing the current tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, the next tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` from `cas_de_test` will be used.
   - Therefore, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will change to the values of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `cas_de_test` remains the same.
- `p1` changes to the first value of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p2` changes to the second value of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p3` changes to the third value of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Since we don't know the exact values of the next tuple, we can only describe the state in terms of the next tuple.

**State:**
- `cas_de_test` is a list of lists.
- `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`.
- `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`.
- `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`**.
