Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list containing the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, `new2` is a list containing the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, list(input())))` takes an input string, converts it into a list of characters, and then maps each character to an integer using the `int` function. This updates the list `a` to contain integers. The values of `i`, `new`, and `new2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
