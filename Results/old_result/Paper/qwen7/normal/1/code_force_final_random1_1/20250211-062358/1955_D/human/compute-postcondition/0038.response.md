Output State: **`i` is less than `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. The variables `i`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that `i` is incremented by 1. The precondition that `i` is less than `m` and `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed remains valid.
