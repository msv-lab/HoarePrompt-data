Output State: **`n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, -1]`, `ci` is 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `ci` as the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. Given that the length of `path_ba` is odd and contains 4 elements (as indicated by the list `[b, -1, -1, -1]`), the length is 4. Therefore, `len(path_ba) // 2` equals 2, but since we are performing integer division, `ci` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
