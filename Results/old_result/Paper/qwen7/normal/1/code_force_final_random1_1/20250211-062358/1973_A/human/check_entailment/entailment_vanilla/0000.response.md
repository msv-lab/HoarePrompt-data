### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players. A draw gives 1 point to each player, while a win/loss gives 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The total points scored by all players must be even because each match contributes either 2 points (if one player wins) or 2 points (if it's a draw).
   - The number of matches played should not exceed the total points divided by 2.
   - The score of the third player should not exceed the total number of matches played.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case and checks the conditions mentioned above.
   - It calculates the total points and checks if they are even.
   - It calculates the total number of matches from the total points.
   - It checks if the number of matches is feasible and if the score of the third player does not exceed the number of matches.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula derived from the points distribution.

4. **Testing the Conditions**:
   - For each test case, the program correctly identifies invalid cases where the scores cannot be achieved (e.g., odd total points, more than 3 matches, or third player's score exceeding the number of matches).
   - It correctly calculates the number of draws for valid cases.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - Case (0, 0, 0): No games, no draws -> Output: 0
   - Case (0, 1, 1): One draw between second and third player -> Output: 1
   - Case (0, 2, 3): Invalid (odd total points) -> Output: -1
   - Case (3, 3, 3): Two draws between each pair -> Output: 2
   - Case (3, 4, 5): Invalid (third player's score exceeds possible matches) -> Output: -1
   - Case (1, 1, 10): Six draws between first and second players -> Output: 6
   - Case (0, 0, 6): Two draws between first and second players -> Output: 2

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or returns -1 for invalid cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
