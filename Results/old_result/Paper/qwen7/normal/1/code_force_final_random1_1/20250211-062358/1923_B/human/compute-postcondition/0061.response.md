Output State: `distance` is 2, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices)`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined (as `pos` now points beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`), and `rest` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions hold:
- The variable `distance` increases by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so after all iterations, it will be 2.
- The variable `pos` increments by 1 each time `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` becomes 0. Since the loop continues until `rest` is 0 or `pos` reaches the end of `sorted_indices`, `pos` will eventually become equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.
- The variable `rest` decreases by the value of `delta` in each iteration. Since the loop continues until `rest` is 0, `rest` will be 0 after all iterations.
- The variable `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined because `pos` will point beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices` when the loop ends.
