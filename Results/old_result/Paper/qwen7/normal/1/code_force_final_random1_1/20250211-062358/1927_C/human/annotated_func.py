#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains n integers representing array a, the second line contains m integers representing array b, and the third line contains t test cases. Additionally, the sum of n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        aOnes = 0
        
        bOnes = 0
        
        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                if aOnes < bOnes:
                    aOnes += 1
                else:
                    bOnes += 1
            elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        
        if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `k + 1`, `t` will be `int(input()) + 1`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `bOnes` will hold the total count of numbers that are present in both lists `a` and `b` up to `k`, satisfying the condition where the number of occurrences of the number in `a` is less than or equal to the number of occurrences in `b`. The variable `aOnes` will represent the total count of numbers present in `a` up to `k`, adjusted based on the comparison with `bOnes` and the condition involving `newk`. The variable `k` will retain its original value, and `newk` will be updated to `k // 2` after each iteration. The lists `a` and `b` will remain as they were initialized from the input, and the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` will either be true or false for each test case, determining whether the output will be 'yes' or 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integer arrays (a and b) and an integer k. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of numbers up to k in both arrays, ensuring that the count in array a is less than or equal to the count in array b. If for each test case the counts satisfy the condition where the number of occurrences in a up to k/2 is equal to the number of occurrences in b up to k/2, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function reads input from stdin, processes the data, and outputs the result for each test case to stdout.
