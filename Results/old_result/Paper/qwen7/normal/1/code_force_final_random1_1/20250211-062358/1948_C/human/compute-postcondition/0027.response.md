Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` is at least 3
- `a` is an input string
- `b` is the input string from the user
- Either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<')`

The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

Since the print statement is fixed and does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or any other variables, it will always print the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
