Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` and `t`.
   - `_` is a dummy variable used for iteration.
   - `t` is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 1 (this is the value of the dummy variable `_` in the current iteration).
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer from the input.
   - If `b` is even, `b` is divided by 2 and assigned to both `b1` and `b2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the condition holds as is. If `b` is odd, `a` and `b` retain their original values from the input.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is a dummy variable, its value will be incremented to the next integer in the range (i.e., from 1 to 2).
   - `t` will be decremented by 1 because one iteration has completed.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `t` will be `t - 1`.
   - `_` will be `2` (the next value in the range).

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t = t - 1\), `_` is 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and if `b` is even, `b` is divided by 2 and assigned to both `b1` and `b2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the condition holds as is. If `b` is odd, `a` and `b` retain their original values from the input.**
