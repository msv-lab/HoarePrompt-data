Postcondition: `k` is a list containing the counts of '1' in each of the input strings provided during the loop executions. If the count of '1's at index 0 is equal to the count of '1's at index 1, no change is made to `k`. Otherwise, the count of '1's at index 0 is not equal to the count of '1's at index 1.
