Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4]), and `s` (a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`). It constructs a new list `b` by iterating through `s` and appending elements from `a` based on whether the character is 'L' or 'R'. Then, it computes a running product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, storing intermediate results in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns a reversed list `ans` containing these intermediate results.**
