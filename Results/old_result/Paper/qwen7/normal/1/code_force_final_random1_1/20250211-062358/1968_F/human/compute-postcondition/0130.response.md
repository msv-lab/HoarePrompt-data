Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the current value of `x` is 0; `results` list has 'YES' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
