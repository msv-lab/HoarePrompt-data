Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `x` is an array.
   - `a[i]` is an integer.
   - `b[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - `j` is `j_end + 1`.
   - `n` is the same as before.

4. **Analyze the Loop Body**:
   - If `x[j - 1]` equals 'F', then both `a[i]` and `a[j]` are increased by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` equals 'S', then only `b[j]` is incremented by 1.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `j_end + 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The condition `x[j - 1]` (which is `x[j_end]`) determines whether `a[i]` and `a[j]` are incremented or just `b[j]` is incremented.

Given that `j` is currently `j_end + 1`, the next value of `j` will be `j_end + 2`. We need to consider the possible values of `x[j_end]` to determine the next state.

- If `x[j_end]` is 'F', then both `a[i]` and `a[j_end + 1]` will be incremented by 1.
- If `x[j_end]` is 'S', then only `b[j_end + 1]` will be incremented by 1.

Since the exact value of `x[j_end]` is not specified, we will consider both cases:

### Case 1: `x[j_end]` is 'F'
- `a[i]` is incremented by 1.
- `a[j_end + 1]` is incremented by 1.
- `b[j_end + 1]` remains unchanged.

### Case 2: `x[j_end]` is 'S'
- `a[i]` remains unchanged.
- `a[j_end + 1]` remains unchanged.
- `b[j_end + 1]` is incremented by 1.

However, since we need to provide a single state, we will assume the most general case where `x[j_end]` could be either 'F' or 'S'. Therefore, we will include both possibilities.

### Final State:
State: **`x` is an array, `a[i]` is an integer, `b[j_end + 1]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j_end + 2`, and `n` is the same as before.**

This state accounts for both possible outcomes of the loop body execution based on the value of `x[j_end]`.
