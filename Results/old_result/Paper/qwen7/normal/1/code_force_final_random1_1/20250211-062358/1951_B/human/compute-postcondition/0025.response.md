Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list, `x` is a value for comparison, and `ind` is a list containing 1. If `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is greater than `x`, then no changes are made to `i`, `n`, `a`, or `ind`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, then no changes are made to these variables.
