Output State: **`tc` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing one element which is an input value appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `gr`. Since `gr` was initially a list containing an input value, after appending another input value, `gr` now contains two elements, both of which are input values. However, since the exact values are not specified, we refer to them as "an input value" and "another input value". The values of `tc`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
