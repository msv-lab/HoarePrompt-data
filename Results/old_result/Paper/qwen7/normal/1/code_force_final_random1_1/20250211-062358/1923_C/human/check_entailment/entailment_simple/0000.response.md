Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement.
2. The code calculates cumulative sums (`p`) and cumulative counts of 1s (`c`), but these calculations do not help in determining if a subarray can be transformed into another array `b` satisfying the conditions.
3. The logic inside the inner loop checks if the subarray has more than one element and if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray. This does not guarantee that such an array `b` exists.
4. To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the subarray can be transformed into another array where all elements are different and positive. This requires a different approach, such as checking if the minimum value in the subarray is at least 2 (since all elements must be different and greater than 0).

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
