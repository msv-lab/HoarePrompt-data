Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `resultats` is a list with an additional element `-1`.**

The code appends `-1` to the list `resultats`, which means `resultats` now contains all its previous elements plus `-1`. The values of `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `total_points` remain unchanged.
