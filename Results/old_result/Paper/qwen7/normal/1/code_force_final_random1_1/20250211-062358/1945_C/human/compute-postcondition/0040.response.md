Output State: **`zero` is either 2 or 1; `one` is either 0 or 2 or 1 or 3; `zero_perc` is 200 or 100; `one_perc` is recalculated as ((`zero` - `one`) * 100) // (`n` - (`i` + 2) - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 or 2 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `i` was previously 1 or 2, it is now 2 or 3. If `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` becomes `200 // 2` or `200 // 3`, which simplifies to 100 or approximately 66.67 (rounded down to 66). If `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` becomes `100 // 2` or `100 // 3`, which simplifies to 50 or approximately 33.33 (rounded down to 33). However, since the division is integer division, the exact values are 100 or 200.
- `one_perc` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it directly. It is recalculated as `((zero - one) * 100) // (n - (i + 2) - 1)`, but the exact value depends on the values of `zero`, `one`, `n`, and `i`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
