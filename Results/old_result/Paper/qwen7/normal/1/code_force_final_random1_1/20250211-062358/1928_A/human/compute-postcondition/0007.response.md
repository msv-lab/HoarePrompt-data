Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer input.
- `b` is the second integer input.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
- Either \((a - b == -a)\) with `a` being the current value, or \((b - a == -b)\) with `b` being the current value.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('no')
```

The statement `print('no')` directly prints the string `'no'` without any reference to the variables `a`, `b`, or `t`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **no**
