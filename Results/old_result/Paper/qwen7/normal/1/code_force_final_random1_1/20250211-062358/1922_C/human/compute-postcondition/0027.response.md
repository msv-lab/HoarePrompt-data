Output State: **`d2[n - 1]` is set to 1, and the dictionary `d1` remains unchanged from its initial state.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d2[n - 1] = 1` sets the value of `d2[n - 1]` to 1. However, the code does not modify the dictionary `d1` in any way. Therefore, `d1` retains its initial state where the keys are integers from 2 to `n-1`, and the values are determined by the conditions specified in the initial state. The other variables `n` and `l` remain unchanged as well.
