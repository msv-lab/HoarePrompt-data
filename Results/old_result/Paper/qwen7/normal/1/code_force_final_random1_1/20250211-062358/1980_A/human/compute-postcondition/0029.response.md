Output State: **`a` is a list with the elements from `test_cases[_][0]`, `n` is set to `test_cases[_][0]`, `m` is set to `test_cases[_][1]`, and `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `freq` with 7 elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `freq` is a new list with 7 zeros.
