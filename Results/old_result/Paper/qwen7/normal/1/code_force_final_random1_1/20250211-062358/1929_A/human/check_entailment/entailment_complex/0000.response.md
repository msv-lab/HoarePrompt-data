Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that iterates `ntest` times.

2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`). It then sorts the array.

3. **Beauty Calculation**: After sorting, the beauty of the array is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array. Since the array is sorted, the maximum value is `a[n-1]` and the minimum value is `a[0]`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

5. **Loop Completion**: The loop completes all iterations as intended, and the program handles all test cases as specified.

Given the above points, the program accurately computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case and outputs the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
