Postcondition: `ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` remains the same, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a', `cur` is either 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` or 0, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'.
