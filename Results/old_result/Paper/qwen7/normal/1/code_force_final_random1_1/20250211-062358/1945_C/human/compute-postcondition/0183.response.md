Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n - 1):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `zero` is 1
   - `zero_perc` is 50
   - `one_perc` is 50
   - `lst` contains the value 2

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The condition `n > 0` remains the same because the value of `n` does not change within the loop itself; it is only dependent on the initial value or external conditions.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `zero` is 1 (unchanged)
   - `zero_perc` is 50 (unchanged)
   - `one_perc` is 50 (unchanged)
   - `lst` contains the value 2 (unchanged)

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `lst` contains the value 2**
