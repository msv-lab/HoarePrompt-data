You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n

        print(*a)
        
    #State: The list `a` will be a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000, and each subsequent element being the cumulative sum of 1000 plus the sum of all elements in `x` up to that point.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a list `a` of length `n`, where the first element is set to 1000, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of 1000 plus the sum of all preceding elements in `x`. The function prints the list `a` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an array \( x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n \).
- Find an array \( a_1, \ldots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size \( n \) of the array and the array \( x \).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is initialized as a list of zeros with length \( n \).
   - `a[0]` is set to 1000. This is a fixed value and does not depend on the input.

3. **Array Construction**:
   - For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \), the value of \( a[i] \) is calculated as \( a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).

4. **Output**:
   - The array \( a \) is printed.

### Checking the Solution:
- The solution sets \( a[0] = 1000 \), which is within the allowed range.
- For each subsequent element \( a[i] \), it is computed as \( a[i-1] + x[i-1] \). This ensures that \( a_i > a_{i-1} \), satisfying the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

However, we need to verify if this construction always produces a valid sequence \( a \) that satisfies the given conditions.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
- According to the program:
  - \( a[0] = 1000 \)
  - \( a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 2 = 1002 \)
  - \( a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1002 + 4 = 1006 \)
  - \( a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 1006 + 1 = 1007 \)

- The resulting array \( a = [1000, 1002, 1006, 1007] \) should satisfy:
  - \( x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1 \)
  - \( x_3 = a_3 \bmod a_2 \)
  - \( x_4 = a_4 \bmod a_3 \)

- Checking these:
  - \( 2 = 1002 \bmod 1000 \) (which is true)
  - \( 4 = 1006 \bmod 1002 \) (which is true)
  - \( 1 = 1007 \bmod 1006 \) (which is true)

This specific example works, but let's consider another case to ensure generality.

### Another Example:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
1 1
```
- According to the program:
  - \( a[0] = 1000 \)
  - \( a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 1 = 1001 \)
  - \( a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1001 + 1 = 1002 \)

- The resulting array \( a = [1000, 1001, 1002] \) should satisfy:
  - \( x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1 \)
  - \( x_3 = a_3 \bmod a_2 \)

- Checking these:
  - \( 1 = 1001 \bmod 1000 \) (which is true)
  - \( 1 = 1002 \bmod 1001 \) (which is true)

This also works. However, the general approach might not cover all edge cases, especially when \( x_i \) values are very small compared to the initial value of \( a[0] \).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution seems to work for the examples given, but it does not guarantee a correct solution for all possible inputs due to the arbitrary choice of \( a[0] = 1000 \). A more robust approach would be to start with a larger initial value and adjust based on the \( x \) values to ensure the modulo condition holds.
