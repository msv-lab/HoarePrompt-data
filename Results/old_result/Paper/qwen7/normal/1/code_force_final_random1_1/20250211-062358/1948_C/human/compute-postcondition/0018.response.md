Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 6, `i` is 5, `step` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of characters. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of these conditions are met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
