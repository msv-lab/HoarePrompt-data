Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value, `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value, `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three space-separated values, and converts each value to an integer before assigning them to `A`, `B`, and `C`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
