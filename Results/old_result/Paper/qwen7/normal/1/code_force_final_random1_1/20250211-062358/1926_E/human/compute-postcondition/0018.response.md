Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing the values `[2, m, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code initializes `tot` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, or `m`. The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `m`, where `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. The list `L` is appended with `m` in each iteration. Since `n` starts as 0, the loop does not run at all, and `n` remains 0. Therefore, `L` contains the initial value of `m`, which is `(n + 1) // 2 = (0 + 1) // 2 = 1`, but since the list is appended with `m` twice more (as per the initial state description), `L` ends up as `[2, m, m]` where `m` is 1.
