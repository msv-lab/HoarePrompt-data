Output State: **`ind` is 1; `elements[line[1]]` is `False, 1`; `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`**

Explanation: The code `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` changes the value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. Given that `ind` is 1, `line[1]` refers to the second element in the `line` list, and `elements[line[1]]` is initially `i, 1`, after executing the code, `elements[line[1]]` becomes `False, 1` and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
