Output State: **`i` is 1; `c1` is unchanged; `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains the tuple `(c1, 1)`. Since `i` is 1 and `c1` is unchanged, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c2, 1)`. Therefore, `ops` now contains both `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`.
