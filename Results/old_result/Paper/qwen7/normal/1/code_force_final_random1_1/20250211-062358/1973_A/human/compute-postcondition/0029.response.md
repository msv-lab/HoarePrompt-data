Postcondition: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, and `resultats` is a list with an additional element `-1`. If `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`, then the function does not change `resultats`; otherwise, `resultats` remains unchanged.**
