Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings, `command` is ('obj', 'com'), `time` is `time` + 1, `pos` is updated to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]). If `isPlayer(obj)` evaluates to true, `elements[obj]` is also updated to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]). If `isPlayer(obj)` evaluates to false, `elements[obj]` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `com` is 'T' and the goalIn(pos) is not -1, then the team corresponding to the goal position has its points incremented by 1.
