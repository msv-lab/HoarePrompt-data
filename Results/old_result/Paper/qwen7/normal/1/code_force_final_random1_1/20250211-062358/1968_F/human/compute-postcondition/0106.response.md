Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` becomes `[i]` if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3, `x`, `v1`, and `v2` are not defined.**

Explanation:
- `total` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0.
- `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `data[0] - 1`.
- `results` remains unchanged as it was initially a list of 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO'.
- `n` is updated to the value of `int(data[idx])`.
- `idx` is incremented by 2.
- `a[i]` is set to `int(data[idx])`.
- `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
- `mp[pf[i]]` is added to the list `[i]` if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`.
- `i` is updated to `n - 1`.
- `idx` is updated to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3.
- `x`, `v1`, and `v2` remain undefined as they were not defined before and no operations were performed on them.
