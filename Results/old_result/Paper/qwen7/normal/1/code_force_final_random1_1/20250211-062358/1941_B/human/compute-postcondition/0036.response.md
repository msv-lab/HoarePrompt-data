Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 4; `opNum` is 0; `a[i]` is `a[2]`; `a[i + 1]` is `a[3]`; `a[i + 2]` is `a[4] - 0` or simply `a[4]`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` subtracts `opNum` (which is 0) from `a[i + 2]`. Since `i` is 2, `i + 2` is 4. Therefore, `a[4]` is updated by subtracting 0 from its current value, which does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
