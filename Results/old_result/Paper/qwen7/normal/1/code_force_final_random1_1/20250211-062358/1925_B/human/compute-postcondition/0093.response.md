Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n` from the given range statement `for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `x` remains the same as before.
   - `n` remains the same as before.
   - `ans` is updated based on the condition: if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is true, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `(x // i)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 2`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains the same unless the condition is met, but since we are adjusting the state before the condition is checked, `ans` remains the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
- `i` should be `k + 2`.
- `x` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ans` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x` is the same as before, `n` is the same as before, `ans` is the same as before**.
