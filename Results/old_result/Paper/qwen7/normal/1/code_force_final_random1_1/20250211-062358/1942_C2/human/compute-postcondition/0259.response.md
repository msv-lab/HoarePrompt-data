Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `t1` is `(a[3] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the variable `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is not specified, but since no initial value for `ans` is given, we assume it to be 0 (as it's the default value for integers). After executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
