Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`; `s` remains the same; `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a'; `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`; `cnt` is 3; `ans` remains the first character of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was previously 2, it is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
