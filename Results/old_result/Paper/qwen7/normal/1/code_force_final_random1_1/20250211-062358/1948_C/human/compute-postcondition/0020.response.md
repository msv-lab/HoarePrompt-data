Output State: The loop will execute for all odd numbers from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If at any point during the loop, the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true, the loop will break and print 'No'. If the loop completes without breaking, it will print 'Yes'.

In the final output state, if the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, the output will be 'Yes'. If the loop breaks due to the condition being met at any iteration, the output will be 'No'. The values of `n`, `i`, `step`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the last state of the loop before printing the result.
