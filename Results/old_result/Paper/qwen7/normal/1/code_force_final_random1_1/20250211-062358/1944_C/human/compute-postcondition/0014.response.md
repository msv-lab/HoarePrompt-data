The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`. This means the loop will continue as long as the value at `nums[start]` is not zero.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `start` is 1
- `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 1`
- `vis` contains the element 0
- The current value of `nums[start + 1]` (which is `nums[2]`) is decreased by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `nums[start]` must not be zero. Currently, `start` is 1, so we need to check `nums[1]`.

Since the loop head only involves `nums[start]`, we need to ensure that `nums[1]` is not zero. No other states need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `nums[1]` should not be zero.

State: **`start` is 1; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 1`; `vis` contains the element 0; the current value of `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1; `nums[1]` is not zero**
