Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list containing the single integer 0, `c` is a list containing the single integer 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, and if `x` is 1, then `j` is increased by 1; `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is increased by `x`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, and if `x` equals 1, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged; `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by `x`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is increased by the next element in `l` and equals the previous value of `i` plus the next element in `l`; `x` is the next element in `l`; `j` remains unchanged; `l` is a non-empty list of integers; `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by the next `x`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`; `c` is appended with the current value of `j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
