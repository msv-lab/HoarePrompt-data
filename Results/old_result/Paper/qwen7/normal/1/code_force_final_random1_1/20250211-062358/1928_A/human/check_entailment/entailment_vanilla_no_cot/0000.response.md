Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for Printing 'yes' or 'no':**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` checks if both dimensions are even. If so, it prints 'yes', which is incorrect. An even dimension alone does not guarantee that a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrectly formatted and does not make sense. It should be checking if the difference between dimensions is odd, but the format is wrong.
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is redundant and incorrect. The modulo operation `%` always returns a non-negative remainder, so `(a - b) % 2 > 0` is equivalent to checking if the difference is odd, but the `or (a - b) % 2 < 0` part is unnecessary since the result of a modulo operation is never negative.

2. **Logic for Determining if a New Rectangle Can Be Formed:**
   - A new rectangle can be formed if either dimension is even, because an even dimension allows for cutting into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, no new rectangle can be formed from the cuts.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

This version correctly checks if at least one of the dimensions is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for being able to form another rectangle.
