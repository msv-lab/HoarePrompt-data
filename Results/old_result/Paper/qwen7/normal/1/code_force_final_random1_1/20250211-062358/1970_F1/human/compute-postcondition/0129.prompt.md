Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ind` is `len(line)`, `i` is 1, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin` and updated to be the result of `stdin.readline().strip().split()`, `grid` is a list containing three elements where the third element is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary where for every non-`.` character in the new `line`, the key is the character and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in the new `line`
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ind` is either 1 or 2, `elements[line[0]]` is `i, 1`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns True, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, then either `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, 1)`, or `line[ind][1]` is not 'G'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 1; `elements[line[1]]` is `False, 1`; if `isPlayer(line[1])` evaluates to `False`, then `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`; otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` equals 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 3, `elements[line[1]]` is either `(i, 3)` or remains as `False, 1`, `isPlayer(line[1])` evaluates to False, `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` equals 'B' or `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, 1)` or `(i, 3)` depending on the condition evaluated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
