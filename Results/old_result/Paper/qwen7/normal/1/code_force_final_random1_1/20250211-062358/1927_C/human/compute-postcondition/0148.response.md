Output State: **`t` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `aOnes` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `aOnes` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
