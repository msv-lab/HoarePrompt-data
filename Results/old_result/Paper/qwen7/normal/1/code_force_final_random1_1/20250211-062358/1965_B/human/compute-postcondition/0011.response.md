Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `l`.
   - The loop runs from `2` to `l-1` (inclusive).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `l` must be at least 2
   - `ans` contains the value 4

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `l`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - Therefore, `i` should be updated to 3.
   - The value of `l` remains unchanged as it must still be at least 2.
   - The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the loop variables.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `l` must be at least 2, `ans` contains the value 4**
