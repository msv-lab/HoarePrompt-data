Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for all possible configurations of the grid. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function seems overly complex and does not accurately simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of the grid characters.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
4
<>>
```

The expected output for this test case would be:
```
3 3
```

However, running the provided program with this input produces incorrect results. The program fails to correctly handle the scenario where the pinball bounces back and forth between two adjacent cells before finally leaving the grid. This complexity is not adequately addressed in the current implementation, leading to incorrect outputs for certain configurations.
