Output State: `current_year` is equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` for the smallest `ai` in `a` where `current_year % ai == 0`, and `a` contains at least one element.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `current_year` will be the result of the last calculation performed within the loop. This calculation involves finding the smallest element `ai` in the list `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`, and then updating `current_year` to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. The list `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
