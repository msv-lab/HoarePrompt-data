Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `cnt_b[i]` is 0.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for i in b_values:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `b_values`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `b_values` that have not been processed yet.
3. **State Adjustment**: We need to adjust the state of `i` and `b_values`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt_b[i]` is 0. This means that `i` was the last element processed from `b_values`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `b_values`.
3. **Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be incremented to the next value in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` will be updated to 0 for the new `i`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[i]` will be 0.

### Final State:
State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0, where `i` is the next element in `b_values`**.

This means that `i` has been incremented to the next value in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[i]` is reset to 0 for this new `i`.
