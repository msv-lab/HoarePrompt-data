Postcondition: `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 1. If the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the nth row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the nth row in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, no change is made to `impossible`.
