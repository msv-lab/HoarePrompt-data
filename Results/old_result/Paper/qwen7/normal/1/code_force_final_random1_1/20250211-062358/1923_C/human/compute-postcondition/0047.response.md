Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is set to `m - 1`, which means `m` is one less than its original value.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
