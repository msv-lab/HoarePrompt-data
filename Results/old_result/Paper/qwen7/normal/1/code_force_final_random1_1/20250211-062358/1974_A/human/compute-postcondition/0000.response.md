Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
