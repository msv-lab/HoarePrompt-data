Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 7, `power` is 7.**

Explanation: The variable `power` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 8 to 7. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
