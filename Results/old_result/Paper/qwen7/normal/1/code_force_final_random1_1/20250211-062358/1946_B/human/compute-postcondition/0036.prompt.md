Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is equal to `n`, `smin` is `[0]`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is less than `n`, if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is updated to `[0, suf[i + 1]]`. Otherwise, `smin` remains unchanged as a list with one additional element which is equal to `smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1, `smin` is updated by appending either `suf[i + 1]` or `smin[i]` to the list, whichever is smaller.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1, `smin` is a list of integers. If `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, then `smin` is updated to include `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` is updated to include `smin[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
