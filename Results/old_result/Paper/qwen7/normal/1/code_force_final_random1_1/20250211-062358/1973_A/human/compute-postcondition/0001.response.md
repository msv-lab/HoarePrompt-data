Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` which is being unpacked from each inner list in `cas_de_test`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the variables being initialized in each iteration of the loop.
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - `resultats` is an empty list and does not affect the loop initialization.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `cas_de_test` to unpack into `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - Each inner list in `cas_de_test` must contain valid values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (i.e., 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `cas_de_test` has at least one element to allow the loop to start.
   - Since `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, this does not directly affect the loop initialization but might be relevant for other parts of the program logic.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `cas_de_test` must have at least one inner list.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be initialized to the first set of values from the first inner list in `cas_de_test`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists that must have at least one inner list, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list**.
