Output State: `t` is 0, `test_cases` retains its initial list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the sum of `missing` values calculated for each iteration of the loop.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `t` (the number of test cases) will be reduced to 0 since each iteration decreases `t` by 1. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The `results` list accumulates the `missing` value for each test case, resulting in a list where each element is the sum of `missing` values calculated for each respective test case.
