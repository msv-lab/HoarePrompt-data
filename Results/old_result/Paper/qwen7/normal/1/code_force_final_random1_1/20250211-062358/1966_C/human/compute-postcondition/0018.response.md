Output State: **`tc` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` iteratively from `i = 1` to `i = n-1, `arr` is updated from user input.**

Explanation:
- The code takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, removes duplicates using `set()`, sorts the resulting list in descending order, and appends 0 to the end.
- The variable `arr` is updated with the new sorted list.
- The values of `tc`, `i`, `n`, and `dp` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The variable `n` is now the length of the updated `arr` minus 1.
- The variable `arr` is now a list of unique integers in descending order followed by 0.
