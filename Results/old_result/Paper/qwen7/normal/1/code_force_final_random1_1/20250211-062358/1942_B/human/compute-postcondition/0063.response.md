Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. The variable `i` remains unchanged, as does the list `res`. The value of `res[i]` is updated to reflect the new value of `mex - ar[i]`.
