Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \(n\), \(k\), and \(q\), along with two lists \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it handles \(q\) queries, where each query involves finding an interpolated value based on the lists \(a\) and \(b\). After processing all queries for all test cases, it outputs the results of these queries.**
