Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has 'YES' appended to it if `x == 0`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `r` in the sorted list `v2` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates the index `it2` as the leftmost insertion point of `r` in the sorted list `v2` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
