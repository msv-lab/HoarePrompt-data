Output State: **`i` is "400003", `j` is "0", `pd['400003']` is 8**

Explanation: The code `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the value of `pd[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is "400003" and `i - 1` is "400002", and `pd['400002']` is 8, the value of `pd['400003']` is updated to 8. The values of `i`, `j`, and `pd['400002']` remain unchanged.
