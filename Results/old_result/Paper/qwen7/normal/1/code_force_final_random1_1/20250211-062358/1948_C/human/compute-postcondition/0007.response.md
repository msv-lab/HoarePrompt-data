Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `step` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
- The current value of `i` is 1.
- Either (`a[1]` is equal to `<` and `b[2]` is equal to `<`), or (`a[1]` is equal to `<` and `b[0]` is equal to `<`).

The `print('No')` statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
