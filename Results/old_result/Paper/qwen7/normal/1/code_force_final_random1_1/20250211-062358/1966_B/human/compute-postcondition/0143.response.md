Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either the first element of the first row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the first row, or the first element of the last row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the last row; `impossible` remains `False`.**

Explanation: The loop runs as long as `j < m - 1`. Given that the loop has executed three times, it means `j` has reached `m - 1`, so `j` will be set to `m`. Since the condition inside the loop does not change `impossible` and only checks the elements of the `gr` matrix, and there was no information suggesting `impossible` became `True` during these iterations, `impossible` remains `False`. The value of `j` will be `m` after the loop completes all its iterations.
