Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **String Processing**: The function `func_1` processes the string `s` to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The logic in `func_1` seems to handle the cumulative distances correctly for both directions ('<' and '>').

3. **Cumulative Distance Calculation**:
   - For the leftward direction (">"), it calculates the distance from each ">" to the previous ">" and sums these distances appropriately.
   - For the rightward direction ("<"), it calculates the distance from each "<" to the next "<" and sums these distances appropriately.

4. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program correctly computes the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell based on the cumulative distances and the direction of movement.
   - The logic for updating the indices and calculating the time is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells (leftmost or rightmost) correctly.
   - It also handles cases where there are no ">" or "<" characters correctly by printing the appropriate time.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the handling of edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
