Output State: **`tmp` now contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `a` and `i` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decreased by the expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. The other variables (`tmp`, `ans`, `a`, and `i`) retain their previous values.
