Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(1, len(b))`. This means `i` should be less than `len(b)` and greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 3.
   - `bd` is a list containing the values `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[3] - b[2]`.

4. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `len(b)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 3 to 4.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `bd` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop head variable `i`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 4, `bd` is a list containing the values `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[3] - b[2]`**
