You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until there are no more lines of input. For each iteration, `s` will be the current line from the input, `n` will be an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, and `k` will be an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int. After processing each line, the values of `n` and `k` will swap roles, meaning the role of `n` and `k` will alternate between holding the split values of `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the loop continues with the new values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is `4 * n - 3`, it will print `2 * n - 1` and then swap `n` and `k`. If `k` is `4 * n - 2`, it will print `2 * n` and then swap `n` and `k`. This process repeats until all lines of input are processed.
    #
    #The final output will consist of a series of printed values, each determined by the conditions specified within the loop, based on the alternating values of `n` and `k` derived from each line of input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes values for t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers within specific ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
