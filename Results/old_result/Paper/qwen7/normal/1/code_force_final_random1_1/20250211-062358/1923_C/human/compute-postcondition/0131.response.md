Output State: **`x` is equal to the first element of `l` and is currently 1, `i` is increased by 1 and is now 2, `j` is increased by 1 and is now 2, `p` is a list containing the value 2, `c` is a list containing the value 2.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` (which is 2) to the list `c`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` becomes a list containing the value 2.
