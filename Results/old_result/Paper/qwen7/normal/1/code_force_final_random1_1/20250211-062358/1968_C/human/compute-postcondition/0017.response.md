Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer using map and int functions.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `a` with `n` elements, each set to 0. This means `a` is now a list of length `n` filled with zeros. The other variables (`num_iterations`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
