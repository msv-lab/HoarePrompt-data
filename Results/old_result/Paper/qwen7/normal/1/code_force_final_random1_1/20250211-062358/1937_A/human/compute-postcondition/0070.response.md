Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers: t and n. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function processes these values, though the specific operation is not detailed here.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific operations within the function, the focus is on accepting and validating the input values for each test case.
