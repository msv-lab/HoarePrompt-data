Output State: **`score` is `l[i + 2] + l[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The value of `score` is incremented by `l[i]`. Initially, `score` was equal to `l[i + 2]`. After executing the line `score += l[i]`, `score` now holds the value of `l[i + 2] + l[i]`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
