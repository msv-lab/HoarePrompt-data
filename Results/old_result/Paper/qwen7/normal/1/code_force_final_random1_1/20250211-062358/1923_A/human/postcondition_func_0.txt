The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the binary string), and a binary string `arr` representing cells (0 for free, 1 for containing a chip). For each test case, it finds the first and last positions of '1' in `arr`, extracts the substring between these positions, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. The function outputs the count of '0's for each test case.
