Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]`**.

The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. The value of `l` is still greater than or equal to `r`, and `a` is still the value of `B[r]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `n` must still be greater than 0. The value of `r` is decreased by 1, but since the exact value of `r` was not specified, we only know it has been decreased by 1.
