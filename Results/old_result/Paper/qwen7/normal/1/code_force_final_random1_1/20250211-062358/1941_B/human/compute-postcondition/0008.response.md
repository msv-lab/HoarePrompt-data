Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting a string and converting each element to an integer.
- The conditions for `b` are either `b[0] % 2 == 0` or `b[1] == b[0] + 2`, and either `b[-1] % 2 == 0` or `b[-2] == b[-1] + 2`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

Given these conditions, the value printed does not depend on the specific values of `t`, `a`, or the contents of `b`. The only thing being printed is the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
