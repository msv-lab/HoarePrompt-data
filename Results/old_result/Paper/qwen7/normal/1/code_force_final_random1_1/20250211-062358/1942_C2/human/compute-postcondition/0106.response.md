Output State: **`ii` is 1, `i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is an integer plus `y`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial values of `ii`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, `ii` is still 1, `i` is still `len(a)`, and `ans` is still an integer plus `y`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are the integers input by the user.
