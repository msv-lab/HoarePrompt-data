Output State: **`j` is equal to `m - 2`, `impossible` remains False, `m` must be greater than 3, and `ans` is 'NO'**.

The code simply assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `j`, `impossible`, and `m` are still as they were in the initial state.
