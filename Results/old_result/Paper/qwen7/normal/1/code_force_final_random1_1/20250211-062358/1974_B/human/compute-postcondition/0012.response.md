Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `char` from the string `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`s`**: This is the string being processed. Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, the string itself does not change within the loop. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `s`.
   - **`char`**: This variable holds the current character being processed in the loop. After each iteration, `char` will hold the next character in `s`.
   - **`unique_chars`**: This is a list that keeps track of unique characters encountered so far. Depending on whether `char` is already in `unique_chars`, the list may be modified.
   - **`j`**: This variable is used to manage the index in the `unique_chars` list. It is incremented or decremented based on whether `char` is found in `unique_chars`.

Given the postcondition:
- If `char` is a character in the set `unique_chars`, then all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced by `unique_chars[j]`, and `j` is decremented by 1.
- If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, then `unique_chars` contains the character `char` at index `i+1`, and `j` is increased by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- If `char` is in `unique_chars`, it means `j` was decremented.
- If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, it means `j` was incremented.

For the next iteration:
- `char` will be the next character in `s`.
- If `char` is in `unique_chars`, `j` will be decremented.
- If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `j` will be incremented.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `char` will be the next character in `s`.
- `j` will be adjusted based on whether `char` is in `unique_chars`.

**Final State:**
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `char` becomes the next character in `s`.
- `j` is adjusted (decremented if `char` is in `unique_chars`, incremented otherwise).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `s`, `j` is adjusted (decremented if `char` is in `unique_chars`, incremented otherwise)**
