Output State: **`i` is 2, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `lst` contains the value 2, `zero_perc` is calculated as 2 * 100 // (2 + 1) which equals 66.67.**

Explanation: Initially, `zero` is 2. Since `s[i]` is not given and the initial state does not specify the value of `s[i]`, we assume no change in `zero` or `one`. The calculation for `zero_perc` is done as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, which translates to `2 * 100 // 3`, resulting in `66.67`. The other variables remain unchanged.
