Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', and `l` is less than `r`; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0**

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[x]` subtracts the value of `B[x]` from `b`. Since `b` was initially equal to `B[r - 1]`, after executing the code, `b` becomes `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
