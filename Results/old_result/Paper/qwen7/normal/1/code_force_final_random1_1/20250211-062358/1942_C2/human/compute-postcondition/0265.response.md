Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is equal to the final value of `x`.
   - `x` is less than or equal to its initial value.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`. Since `i` is initially set to the final value of `x`, the loop will not execute because `i` is already equal to `x`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `i` should be one less than `x`. This way, when the loop starts, `i` will be less than `x`, and the loop will execute at least once.
   - `x` should remain less than or equal to its initial value.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

**State:**
- `i` must be one less than `x` (i.e., `i = x - 1`).
- `x` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value.

So, the final state is:
**`i` is `x - 1`, `x` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value**.
