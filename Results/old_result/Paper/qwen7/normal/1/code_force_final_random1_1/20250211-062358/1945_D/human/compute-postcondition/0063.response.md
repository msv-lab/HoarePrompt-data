Based on the initial state provided:

- `v` is set to -1.
- `best` is the minimum value found during the loop execution, but since no loop has been executed yet, `best` remains undefined or not yet initialized.
- `total` is the sum of costs accumulated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, but again, since no loop has been executed, `total` is also undefined or not yet initialized.
- `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their initial values, meaning they have not been modified and thus remain undefined or retain their default values.

Given this information, the `print(best)` statement will simply print the value of `best`, which has not been initialized or updated during any loop execution. Therefore, the value of `best` is still -1.

Output: **-1**
