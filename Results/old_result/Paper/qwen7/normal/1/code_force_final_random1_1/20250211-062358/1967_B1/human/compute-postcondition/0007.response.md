Output State: **`countmins` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `g` is `int(n / count)`**

In this output state, the value of `g` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`, which is `int(n / 2)`. All other variables retain their initial or previously described states.
