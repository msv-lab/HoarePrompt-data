Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r` is 0, otherwise `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `r - (l + 2)` to `x`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `x` is calculated based on the current values of `r` and `l`.
