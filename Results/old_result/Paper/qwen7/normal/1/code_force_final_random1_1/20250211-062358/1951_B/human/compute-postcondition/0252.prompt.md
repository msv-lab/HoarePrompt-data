Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is equal to `j`, which is `len(s) - 2`; `ans` is the count of elements in `s` from the second element onwards that are not less than `h`; `i` is the last element of `s` that was compared against `h` or the last element of `s` if the loop did not break; `s[0]` and `s[k - 1]` have swapped values; `ans1` is 0; `s[p]` and `s[k - 1]` have swapped values; `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an element in `s` such that `i` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `i` is an integer within `s` that is not equal to `h`. Additionally, if `z` equals 1, `ans1` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an element in `s` such that `i` is not equal to `h`, `s` must still contain at least one element that is not equal to `h`, `z` remains unchanged, and `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `z` equals 1 and `i > h`; otherwise, `ans1` is equal to its original value plus 1 if `s[0] != h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `s` that is not equal to `h`, `s` must still contain at least one element that is not equal to `h`, `z` remains unchanged, and `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `z` equals 1 and `i > h`; otherwise, `ans1` is equal to its original value plus 1 if `s[0] != h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
