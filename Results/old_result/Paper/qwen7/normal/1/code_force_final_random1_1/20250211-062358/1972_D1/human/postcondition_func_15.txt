The function accepts no parameters and processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of iterations, and two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6). For each test case, the function writes `t` lines to the standard output, with each line containing a different positive integer minus 1, as provided by the `func_15()` function. The total number of lines written to the standard output across all test cases equals the sum of `t` values for all test cases.
