Output State: **`ind` is 1; `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` equals 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, 1)`**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Initially, `ind` is 1 and `tmp` is determined by whether `line[1][0]` equals 'B'. The value of `tmp` remains unchanged from its initial state since the code does not alter `line` or `i`. The list `goal[tmp]` is updated by appending the tuple `(i, 1)`.
