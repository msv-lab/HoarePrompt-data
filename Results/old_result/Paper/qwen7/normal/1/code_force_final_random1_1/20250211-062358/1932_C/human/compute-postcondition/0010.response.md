Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'L', `b` is a list with one element `a[r-1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `r`, we cannot determine its new value, but we know that `b` is updated to contain `a[r-1]` instead of `a[r]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
