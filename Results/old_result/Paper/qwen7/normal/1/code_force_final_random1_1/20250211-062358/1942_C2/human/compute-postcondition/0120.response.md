Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where the difference between the first two elements is not equal to 2, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than 0; `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`; `ans` is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1**.

Explanation: The value of `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Given the initial conditions, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and since `i` is 1, the difference is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. After subtracting `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` from `y`, the new value of `y` is greater than 0 because the initial value of `y` was greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
