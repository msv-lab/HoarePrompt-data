Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n-1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `impossible` remains `True`
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `i` is `0`
   - `n` must be greater than `0`
   - Either the first element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the first element of `gr[i + 1]` or the last element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the last element of `gr[i + 1]`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `0` and the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n-1`. Given that `i` is now `1`, `n` must be greater than `1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `1`.
   - `n` must remain greater than `1` to allow the loop to continue.

6. **Postconditions**:
   - `impossible` remains `True` (no change needed).
   - `ans` remains 'NO' (no change needed).
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`impossible` remains `True`, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `1`**.
