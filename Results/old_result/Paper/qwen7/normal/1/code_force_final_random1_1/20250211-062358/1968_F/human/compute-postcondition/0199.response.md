Output State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current index `i` to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Since `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `idx` is increased by 1, and `a[i]` is set to the value from `data[idx]`, the only new information added is that `mp[pf[i]]` now includes the value `i`. All other conditions remain the same as the initial postconditions.
