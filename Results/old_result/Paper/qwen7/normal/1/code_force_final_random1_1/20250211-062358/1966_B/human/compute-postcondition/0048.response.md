Output State: `impossible` is False, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is `j + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 1` minus 1, which simplifies to `n - 2`. The variable `impossible` remains False because it was set to False during the first iteration and has not been changed since. The variable `m` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The variable `n` remains `j + 1` because it is updated inside the loop but never reset, and `j` is defined as `m - 2` and does not change.
