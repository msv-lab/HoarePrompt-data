Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `n - m` must be at least 1; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`**

Explanation: The code increments `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1, where `i` is either 2 or 3. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n - m` must still be at least 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.
