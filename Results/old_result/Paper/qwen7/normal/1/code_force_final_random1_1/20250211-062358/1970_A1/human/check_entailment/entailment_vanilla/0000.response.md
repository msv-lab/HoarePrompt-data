Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: A sequence where the number of opening and closing parentheses is equal, and at any point in the sequence, the number of opening parentheses is greater than or equal to the number of closing parentheses.
2. **Balance Calculation**: The balance of a sequence is the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses.
3. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**: 
   - Compute the balance of the prefix up to each character.
   - Sort the characters based on their prefix balance (ascending) and position (descending).
   - Form a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Provided Solution Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used for sorting but is not actually used in the main function `func_2`.
   - It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Computes the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the position and character in a list `balance_info`.
   - Sorts `balance_info` using the key specified in the lambda function, which sorts by balance (ascending) and position (descending).
   - Constructs the final balanced shuffle sequence by joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Key Points to Verify
1. **Balance Calculation**: The balance is correctly computed for each prefix.
2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic ensures that the sequence is sorted by balance first and then by position.
3. **Character Construction**: The final sequence is constructed correctly by joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Verification
- **Balance Calculation**: The balance is correctly computed for each prefix.
- **Sorting Logic**: The lambda function in `sort` ensures that the sequence is sorted by balance (ascending) and then by position (descending), which matches the problem requirements.
- **Character Construction**: The final sequence is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted list, which is correct.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation for a balanced parentheses sequence.
