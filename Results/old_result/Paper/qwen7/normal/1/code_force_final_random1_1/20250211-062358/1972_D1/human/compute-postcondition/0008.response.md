Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes three integers: t, n, and m. For each test case, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and n and m are integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6 inclusive. The sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6. Based on these inputs, the function performs some unspecified operations and returns an unspecified result for each test case.**

Note: The specific operations and return values are not detailed in the provided information, so the functionality description focuses on the input constraints and the general nature of the function's operation.
