Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 4, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` now either contains 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l` being satisfied in the if part, or if these conditions are not met, `results` contains 'NO', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`**.

This means that the value of `l` is now set to the integer value of `data[idx]`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
