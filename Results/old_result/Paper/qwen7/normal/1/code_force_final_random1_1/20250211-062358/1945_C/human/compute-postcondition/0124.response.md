Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `ele`, which is an element from the list `lst`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the initial state of `lst`**: Since the loop will iterate over `lst`, `lst` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. 

4. **Consider the final state provided**: The final state of the loop is given, but we need to focus on the initial state required for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the list `lst`. Specifically, `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`lst` must contain at least one element**
