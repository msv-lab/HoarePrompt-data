Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `l` will be `len(a) - 1`
- `m` will be `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (a[len(a) - 1] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`
- `i` will be `1`
- `ql` will be `q - a[s - 1]`
- `s` will be `bisect_left(a, q)`

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
The loop head does not explicitly define any variables. However, since the loop is using an underscore `_` as the loop variable, it implies that the loop is iterating `t` times without modifying any specific variables in the loop head. The variables `l`, `m`, `i`, `ql`, and `s` are not directly modified within the loop head but might be modified inside the loop body.

### Adjusting States
Since the loop head does not define any variables to be adjusted, and the loop itself does not modify the variables `l`, `m`, `i`, `ql`, or `s` (as indicated by the use of `_`), these variables remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Conclusion
The states of the variables `l`, `m`, `i`, `ql`, and `s` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because they are not modified in the loop head.

### Final Answer
State: **`l` will be `len(a) - 1`, `m` will be `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (a[len(a) - 1] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`, `i` will be `1`, `ql` will be `q - a[s - 1]`, and `s` will be `bisect_left(a, q)`**
