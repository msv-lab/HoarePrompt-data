State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 ⋅ 10^4, _ is not a variable that needs adjustment as it is a placeholder**.

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python for loop variables when the value of the variable itself is not needed within the loop. It does not affect the loop's execution condition.
- The variable `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects whether the loop can execute. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4). Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` meets this condition.
