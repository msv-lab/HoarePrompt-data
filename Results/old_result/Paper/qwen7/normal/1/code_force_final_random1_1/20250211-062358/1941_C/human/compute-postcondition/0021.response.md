Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length `n`. The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not described here as per the given constraints and format requirements.
