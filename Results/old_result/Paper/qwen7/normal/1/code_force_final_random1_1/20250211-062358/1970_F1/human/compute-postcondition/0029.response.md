Output State: **`tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `i` is updated to `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`, `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[len(line) - 1]`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G' and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) appends a tuple `(elements[line[len(line) - 1]], line[len(line) - 1])` to the list `goal`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `tmp` is assigned a value based on the condition involving the first character of `line[ind]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
