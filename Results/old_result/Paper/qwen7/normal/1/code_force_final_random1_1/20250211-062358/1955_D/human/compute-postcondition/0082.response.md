Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
