Output State: **`n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]; n` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the `break` statement is placed. Since no loop or conditional block is specified, it implies that the `break` statement is likely within a loop or conditional structure that was previously defined but is not shown here. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the loop or conditional block is exited.
