Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `tot` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `coef[0]` is 1**

Explanation: The line `tot = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `tot`. This does not affect any other variables or the conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
