Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`).
3. It sorts the array `a`.
4. It prints the difference between the last (maximum) and first (minimum) elements of the sorted array, which is the maximum possible beauty of the array according to the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program logic matches the requirements. Sorting the array ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum values is maximized, which aligns with the goal of finding the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
