Output State: **`not_c` is False, `A` is False, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `not_c`, `A`, and `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The only effect is that the execution would break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
