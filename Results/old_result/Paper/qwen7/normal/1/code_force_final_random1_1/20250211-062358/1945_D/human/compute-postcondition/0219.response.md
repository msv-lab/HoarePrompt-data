Postcondition: **`y` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than or equal to `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is the sum of `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to 0 plus `a_values[0]`. If `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`.**
