Postcondition: `nx` is either 'SSS', 'FSS', 'SFS', 'FFS', 'SSF', 'FSF', 'SFF', or 'FFF', `j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 2) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, indicating that `nx` can take on any of the specified values ('SSS', 'FSS', 'SFS', 'FFS', 'SSF', 'FSF', 'SFF', 'FFF') based on the conditions within the if and else blocks, while maintaining the other conditions (j is 3, n is a non-negative integer, and the character at position 2 in the list `xx[i]` is not '?').
