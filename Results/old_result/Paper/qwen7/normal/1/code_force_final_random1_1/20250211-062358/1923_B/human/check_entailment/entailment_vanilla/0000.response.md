Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `a` (list of monster healths), `x` (list of monster positions), and `k` (number of bullets).
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distances from the origin (0).
   - It iterates through the sorted indices and tries to kill the monsters.
   - For each group of monsters at the same distance from the origin, it checks if they can be killed before moving closer.
   - If a monster cannot be killed before it reaches the player, it returns `False`.
   - If all monsters can be killed, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters (`n`) and the number of bullets (`k`).
   - It then reads the healths of the monsters (`a`) and their positions (`x`).
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints `YES` if the player can survive, otherwise `NO`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Sorting Based on Distance**:
   - The sorting step ensures that we handle monsters closest to the player first, which is crucial because the player must kill monsters before they can move closer.

2. **Killing Monsters**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted indices and tries to kill monsters using the available bullets.
   - It correctly handles the case where multiple monsters are at the same distance from the player and ensures that enough bullets are used to kill them before they move closer.

3. **Checking if a Monster Can Be Killed**:
   - The function checks if a monster can be killed before it reaches the player by ensuring that the player has enough bullets to reduce its health to zero before it moves.
   - If a monster cannot be killed before it reaches the player, the function immediately returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as when there are no bullets left or when a monster is already dead.
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where the player cannot kill all monsters before they reach the player.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the functions, it appears that the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` is correct according to the problem statement. The function correctly determines whether the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
