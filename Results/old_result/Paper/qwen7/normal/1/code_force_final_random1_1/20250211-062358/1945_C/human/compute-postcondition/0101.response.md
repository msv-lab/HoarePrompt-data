Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.
