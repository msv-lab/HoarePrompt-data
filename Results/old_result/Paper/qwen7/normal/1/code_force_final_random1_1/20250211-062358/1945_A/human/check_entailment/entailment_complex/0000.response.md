Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Modification of `b`**: The program modifies `b` by adding `c`. This means `b` now represents the total number of people who need to share a tent with at least one other person (extroverts and universals combined).

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` calculates the number of tents needed:
     - `-b // 3` computes how many full tents (each with 3 people) can be formed from `b`.
     - `a - -b // 3` subtracts the number of tents already accounted for by `b` from the number of introverts `a`, ensuring that each introvert gets their own tent.
   - The condition `[c < b % 3]` checks if there are any remaining universals (`c`) that cannot form a complete tent with the extroverts (`b % 3`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form additional tents with the extroverts, making it impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences, hence the output is `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the calculation ensures that all participants' preferences are met.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the number of tents required or `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

Given the logic and the provided example, the program appears to handle all cases correctly, including edge cases where it returns `-1` when necessary.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
