Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The line `impossible = True` does not change the value of `impossible`, but rather reassigns it to `True`. All other variables retain their initial states.
