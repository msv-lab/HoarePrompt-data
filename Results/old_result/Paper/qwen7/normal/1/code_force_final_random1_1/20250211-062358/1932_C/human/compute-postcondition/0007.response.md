Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `s[i]` is 'L'; `b` is a list with one element which is `a[l]`; `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was part of the initial state but its exact initial value was not specified, we only know that it has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
