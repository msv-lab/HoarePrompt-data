Output State: **`nx` is either 'SF' or 'FF', `j` is `j + 1`, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'Sxx[i][j - 1]' or 'Fxx[i][j - 1]', otherwise if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` remains unchanged, otherwise `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FF'**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the end of `nx`. Given the initial conditions, `nx` could be either 'S' or 'F'. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'SF' or 'FF'. The other conditions and values of `j`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and `sb` remain unchanged.
