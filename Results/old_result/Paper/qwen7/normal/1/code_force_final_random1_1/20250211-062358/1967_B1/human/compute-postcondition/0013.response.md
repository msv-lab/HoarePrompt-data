Output State: **`countmins` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `g` is `int(n / count) - 1`, and if `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins` (which is 1). Therefore, `g` becomes `int(n / count) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
