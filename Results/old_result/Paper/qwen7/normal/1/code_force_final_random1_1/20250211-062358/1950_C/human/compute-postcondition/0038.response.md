Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440 + n, where n is the number of test cases provided, s is a new string input by the user for each iteration, and h is the first two characters of s.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be incremented by the number of times the loop has run, starting from an initial value between 1 and 1440. For each iteration, `s` will hold the time input by the user in the format "hh:mm", `h` will be the first two characters of `s`, and the output will adjust `h` to represent the time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
