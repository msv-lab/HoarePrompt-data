Output State: `i` is equal to `l`; `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 starting from \(2^2\) up to \(2^l\).

To explain further, since the loop runs from `2` to `l-1` (inclusive), if the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will eventually become equal to `l`. The variable `l` represents the length of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix). During each iteration of the loop, `ans` appends the next power of 2, starting from \(2^2\). Therefore, after all iterations, `ans` will contain all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) up to \(2^l\).
