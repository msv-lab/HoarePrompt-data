You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

    #State: Output State: The `resultats` list will contain one of the following based on the conditions checked within the loop for each inner list in `cas_de_test`:
    #
    #- If any of the conditions cause `-1` to be appended to `resultats`, then `resultats` will end up being a list of `-1`s, with the length equal to the number of inner lists in `cas_de_test`.
    #- If none of the conditions cause `-1` to be appended and all `egalites // 2` values are valid, then `resultats` will be a list containing these valid `egalites // 2` values.

    #The `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` variables will be the last values from the last inner list processed in `cas_de_test`. The `total_points` will be the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` will be `total_points // 2`. `egalites` will be calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if it's non-negative, `egalites // 2` will be appended to `resultats`.
    #
    #If all inner lists in `cas_de_test` pass all conditions without appending `-1`, the final `resultats` will be a list of `egalites // 2` values for each inner list. If any inner list causes `-1` to be appended, `resultats` will consist of `-1`s followed by any valid `egalites // 2` values.

    #The program returns a list `resultats` which contains either `-1` for each inner list in `cas_de_test` if any condition causes `-1` to be appended, or `egalites // 2` for each valid inner list in `cas_de_test` if no `-1` is appended. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the last values from the last inner list processed in `cas_de_test`. `total_points` is the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if it's non-negative, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for certain inputs. For instance, consider the input `(1, 1, 10)`:

- According to the problem description, the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.
- The program calculates the total points and checks if they are even and if the total matches fit within the constraints.
- However, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the maximum number of draws can exceed the number of matches played.

For the input `(1, 1, 10)`, the program incorrectly returns `2` as the maximum number of draws. The correct calculation should consider that with `p3 = 10`, the maximum number of draws is `8` (since each draw gives 1 point to both players, and `10 - 2 = 8`).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the calculated number of draws does not exceed the number of matches played and that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.
