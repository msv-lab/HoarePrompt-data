Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Initial state analysis**:
   - Since `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 2 (because `i < n - 1` requires `n - 1 > 0`, hence `n >= 2`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is already set to 0, so no adjustment is needed here.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2**
