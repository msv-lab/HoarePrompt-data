Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `test` from the `test_cases` list.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues to execute as long as `current_year` is divisible by any element in `a`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `results` contains the `current_year`, which is the smallest multiple of elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial `current_year`. The loop continues to execute until `current_year` is no longer divisible by any element in `a`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `current_year` must still be divisible by at least one element in `a`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `current_year` remains divisible by at least one element in `a` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop head only involves the variable `test` from `test_cases`, and the loop condition depends on `current_year` being divisible by any element in `a`, we need to ensure that `current_year` is still divisible by at least one element in `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `current_year` is still divisible by at least one element in `a`.

**Answer:**
State: **`results` now contains the current_year, which is the smallest multiple of elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial `current_year`, and `current_year` must be divisible by at least one element in `a`**.
