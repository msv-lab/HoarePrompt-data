Output State: **`j` is within the range 1 to n, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is assumed to be a numeric value. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
