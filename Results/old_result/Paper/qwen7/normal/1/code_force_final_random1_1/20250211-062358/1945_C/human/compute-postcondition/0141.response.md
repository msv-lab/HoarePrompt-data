Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for the remaining elements in `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the element `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`; `final` has appended the element `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. The value of `mini` and the condition for `final` remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, `mini` still contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for the remaining elements in `lst`, and `final` now includes the previously determined element `elem` plus the newly appended `elem`.
