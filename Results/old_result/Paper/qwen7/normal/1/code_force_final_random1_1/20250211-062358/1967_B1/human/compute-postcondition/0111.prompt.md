You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer provided by the user, `m` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `countmins` is equal to `m`, `g` is 0, and `ans` is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the contributions from each iteration of the loop for all `i` from 0 to `t - 1`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the following will be true:
    #- `count` will be `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` until it exceeds `m`.
    #- `i` will be `t - 1` because the loop iterates `t` times, and `i` is the loop counter.
    #- `n` will remain the input integer provided by the user.
    #- `m` will remain the input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4.
    #- `countmins` will be `m` because it is initialized as `count - 1` and `count` becomes `m + 1` at the end of the loop.
    #- `g` will be 0 because the loop breaks when `g` becomes less than `countmins`.
    #- `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the series where each term is `int(int(n / i) / i) + 1` for `i` ranging from 2 to `m`, inclusive, for all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values for `t`, `n`, and `m` where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 2⋅10^6. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for `n` and `m`, ensuring the sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
