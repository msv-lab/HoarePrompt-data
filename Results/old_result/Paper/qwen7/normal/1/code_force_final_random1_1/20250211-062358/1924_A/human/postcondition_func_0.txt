The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves integers t, n, k, m, and a string s. It checks if the string s contains at least n unique substrings of length k. If so, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it identifies the missing character needed to form such substrings and constructs a valid output string, then prints 'NO' followed by the constructed string.
