State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute even once, `t` must be at least 1.
3. The initial state of `t` being within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 ensures that `t` is a valid non-negative integer, but it does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is 0.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Hence, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t must be greater than 0`.
