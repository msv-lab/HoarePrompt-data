Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is set to 2
- `i` is set to 4
- `k` is set to 3
- `res` is an input string (though its value is not needed for this particular print statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `0` is an integer literal.
- `k` is explicitly given as 3.
- `0` is another integer literal.
- `i` is explicitly given as 4.

Therefore, the print statement will output these values in order.

Output: **'? 0 3 0 4'**
