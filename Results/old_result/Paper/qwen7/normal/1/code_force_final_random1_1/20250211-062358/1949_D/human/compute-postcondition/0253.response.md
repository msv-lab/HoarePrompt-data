Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` remains the same (no specific value given, but it stays unchanged)
   - `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`
   - `nx` is either `'FF'` if either `i` or 3 is in the first quarter of `sa`, or a string with an additional 'S' appended to it otherwise.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - `n` remains the same as it did not change during the previous iteration.
   - `xx[i][0]` and `nx` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop variable `j`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` is now 4
   - `n` remains the same
   - `xx[i][0]` is still `'?'`
   - `nx` is still either `'FF'` if either `i` or 3 is in the first quarter of `sa`, or a string with an additional 'S' appended to it otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `j` is 4, `n` remains the same, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, and `nx` is either `'FF'` if either `i` or 3 is in the first quarter of `sa`, or a string with an additional 'S' appended to it otherwise.**
