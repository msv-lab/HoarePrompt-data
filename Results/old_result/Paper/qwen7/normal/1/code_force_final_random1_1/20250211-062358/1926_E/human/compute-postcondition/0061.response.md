Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop is iterating over the list `L` using the variable `a`.
   - Therefore, the objects in the loop head are `a` and `L`.

2. Determine the initial state of these objects:
   - `a` is currently set to 0.
   - `L` is a list `[2, 1, 1]`.

3. Analyze the loop condition:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `L`, assigning the value of each element to `a` in sequence.

4. Adjust the states accordingly:
   - Since the loop will start with the first element of `L`, `a` should be set to the first element of `L`, which is 2.
   - `L` remains the same list `[2, 1, 1]`.

5. Consider other variables:
   - Variables `k`, `pow`, `tot`, `n`, and `m` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. They can remain as they are.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [2, 1, 1]**
