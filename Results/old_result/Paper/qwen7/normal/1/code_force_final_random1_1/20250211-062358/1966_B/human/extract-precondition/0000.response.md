Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m filled with characters 'W' and 'B' representing white and black squares respectively. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
