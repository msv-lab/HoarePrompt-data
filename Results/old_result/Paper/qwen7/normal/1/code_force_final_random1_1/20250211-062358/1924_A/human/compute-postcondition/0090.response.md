Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`; `s` remains the same; `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a'; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is 3; `ans` remains the first character of `s`.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. All other variables (`ss`, `s`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
