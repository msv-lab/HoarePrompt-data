Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the field (N and M respectively), with 3 <= N, M <= 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains M characters. The list has N strings. The list contains pairs of characters representing players, goals, the Quaffle, and a Bludger, as described in the problem statement. Additionally, b is an integer representing the number of steps T in the game, with 0 <= T <= 10000.**
