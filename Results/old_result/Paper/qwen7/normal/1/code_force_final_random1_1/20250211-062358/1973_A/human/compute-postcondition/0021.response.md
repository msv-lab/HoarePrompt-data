Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and assigns it to the variable `total_points`. The values of `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
