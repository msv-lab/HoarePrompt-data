Output State: **`start` is 3; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`; `nums[1] is `nums[1] - 2`; `nums[2]` is `nums[2] - 1`; `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` are updated according to their respective expressions, but since the initial values are not provided, they remain in the form of `nums[0] - 2`, `nums[1] - 2`, and `nums[2] - 1`. The set `vis` remains unchanged as it only contains the elements 0, 1, and 2.
