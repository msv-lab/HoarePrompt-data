Output State: **`res` is an input from the user, `i` is 4, `k` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still a precondition but not a variable that has been updated.
