Output State: **`ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and all a_i's are distinct positive integers not exceeding 10^9. The list a is sorted in non-decreasing order; `x` is the k-th element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ind`. The values of `a`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state.
