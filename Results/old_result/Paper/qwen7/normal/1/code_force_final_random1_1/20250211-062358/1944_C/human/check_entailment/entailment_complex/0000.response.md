### Reasoning:

The annotated program provided seems to have several unnecessary functions and a significant misunderstanding of the game rules and the objective of finding the MEX of the array `c`. The core logic of the program is not aligned with the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Unnecessary Functions**: The program includes several functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not used in the main logic and do not contribute to solving the problem. These can be safely ignored.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding MEX**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the MEX by iterating through the array `arr` and counting occurrences using a `Counter`. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the game process where Alice and Bob take turns removing elements from `a` and appending them to `c`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not properly simulate the game rules. Specifically, it does not account for the different removal patterns of Alice and Bob (Alice appends to `c` and removes from `a`, while Bob only removes from `a`).

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The game involves alternating turns between Alice and Bob, with Alice always appending to `c` and Bob removing from `a`.
   - To find the MEX of `c` optimally, we need to simulate these turns and track the elements added to `c`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, so she should try to add unique elements to `c` to avoid repeating elements.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX, so he should remove elements that could potentially increase the MEX.

Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and cannot produce the correct MEX values for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not properly simulate the game process and does not correctly compute the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: **False**
