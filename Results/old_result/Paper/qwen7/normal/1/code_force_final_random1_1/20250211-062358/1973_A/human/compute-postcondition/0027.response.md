Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `resultats` is a list with an additional element `-1`.**

The code snippet `resultats.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `resultats`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables (`cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and only `resultats` gains an additional element `-1`.
