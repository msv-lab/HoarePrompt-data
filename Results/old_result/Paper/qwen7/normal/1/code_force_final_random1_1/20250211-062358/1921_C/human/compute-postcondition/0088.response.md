Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than or equal to the maximum index present in `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`).
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.

2. **List `arr`:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

3. **List `array2`:**
   - `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for every `j` in the range from `3` to `n-1` inclusive, provided that `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`.

4. **Condition for `array2`:**
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print('No')` statement:

- The statement `print('No')` simply prints the string `'No'`.
- There are no variables or expressions inside the `print` statement that would change this output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
