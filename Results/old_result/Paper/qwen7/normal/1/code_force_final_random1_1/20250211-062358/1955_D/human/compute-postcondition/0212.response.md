Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `b_values`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will iterate over each element in `b_values`. For the loop to execute, `b_values` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**: Since the loop iterates over elements in `b_values`, the initial state of `i` should be set to the first element of `b_values`.

Given the postconditions and the loop structure, the key points to consider are:
- `i` must be an element of `b_values`.
- `b_values` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
- `i` must be an element of `b_values`.
- `b_values` must contain at least one element.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` must be an element of `b_values`**.
