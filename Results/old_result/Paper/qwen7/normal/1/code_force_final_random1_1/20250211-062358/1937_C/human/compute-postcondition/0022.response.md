Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `n` must be greater than the final value of `i`, which is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is also `n-1`, and `res` is an input string. If `res` equals '<' at any point during the loop, `k` will be updated to the current value of `i`.**

This means that after the loop completes, `i` and `k` will both be equal to `n-1`, assuming that `res` was never equal to '<' or that it did not affect the final values of `i` and `k`. The value of `n` must be greater than `n-1` (which is logically always true as long as `n > 1`).
