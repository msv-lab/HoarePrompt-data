Output State: **`tc` is 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 3, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the final state of the variables can be determined as follows:
- `tc` will be 3 because the loop iterates `t` times, and we are considering the case where `t` is 3.
- `i` will be `n - 2` because the loop involving `i` runs from 0 to `n - 2`.
- `ans` will be 'NO' because the conditions under which `ans` could be set to 'YES' are not met based on the given postconditions.
- `impossible` will remain `True` because none of the conditions that could set it to `False` were met.
- `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop involving `i` runs from 0 to `n - 2`, implying `n > 1`.
- `m` must be greater than 3 because the problem specifies that `m` is greater than 3 in the first iteration.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element, as per the given postconditions.
