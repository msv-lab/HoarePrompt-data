To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the process step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is equal to `l`.
   - `l` is a positive integer.
   - `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of the current value of `j` in the reversed `array` (starting from `j` to the end of the array) and then indexing into the `alp` list with that count minus one.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Since `j` is equal to `l`, the loop that constructs `ans` will not run because the range `0` to `l-1` will not include any valid `j` values (since `j` starts from `0` and goes up to `l-1`, but `j` is already `l`).

3. **Result**:
   - Given that `j` is equal to `l`, the list `ans` will remain empty because no elements will be added to it during the loop.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will join the elements of the list `ans` into a string and print it.

Since `ans` is an empty list, the output will be an empty string.

Output: **''**
