Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is a divisor of `x` and the value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the result is divisible by `i`, these conditions remain true post-execution. The only change is that `ans` now holds the maximum value between its previous value and `i`.
