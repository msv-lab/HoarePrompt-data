Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a tree structure defined by the user through predefined input data. It returns information about the tree, specifically focusing on a set of nodes and their connections, adhering to the constraints where t (the number of test cases) ranges from 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, n (the number of nodes) and k (some specific value related to the nodes) range from 1 to 10^5, with n-1 edges connecting these nodes.**
