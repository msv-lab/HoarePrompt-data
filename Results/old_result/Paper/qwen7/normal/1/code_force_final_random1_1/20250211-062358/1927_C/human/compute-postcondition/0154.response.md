Postcondition: **`bOnes` is 0, `t` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is in both lists `a` and `b`. The number of 1s in list `a` is less than the number of 1s in list `b`**.
