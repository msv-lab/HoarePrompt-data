Output State: **`suf` is updated such that its i-th element is now the sum of its i-th element and `l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `suf` the value of its i-th element plus the i-th element of the list `l`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
