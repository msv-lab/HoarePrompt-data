Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Determine the current values of the loop variables**:
   - `power` is currently 2.
   - `n` is `log2(n_cases)`.
3. **Check if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `power` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Given the information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is `log2(n_cases)`.
- `power` is 2.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, `n_cases` must be greater than \(2^2 = 4\).

So, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 2**
