Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

We need to determine the value of `word` based on the conditions given:

1. If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is "zzzzzz".
2. If `n` is greater than 26 but not greater than 52, then `word` is 'az'.
3. Otherwise, `word` is 'aaa'.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, it could fall into any of these three categories. However, without a specific value for `n`, we can only describe the possible values of `word` based on the conditions.

Given the conditions, the possible values for `word` are:
- "zzzzzz" if `n > 52`
- 'az' if `26 < n <= 52`
- 'aaa' if `1 <= n <= 26`

Since we do not have a specific value for `n`, we cannot pinpoint exactly which value `word` will take. Therefore, the output will depend on the actual value of `n`.

Output: **word (where word is either "zzzzzz", 'az', or 'aaa' based on the value of n)**
