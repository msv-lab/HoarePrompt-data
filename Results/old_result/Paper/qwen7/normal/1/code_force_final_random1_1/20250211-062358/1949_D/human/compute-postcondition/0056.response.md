Output State: **`x` is an array, `a[i]` is an integer, `b[j]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j_end + 1`, and `n` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. The other variables (`x`, `a[i]`, `j`, `j_end`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
