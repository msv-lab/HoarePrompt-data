Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `idx` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `idx` is still 2, `t` is still an integer value from `data[0]`, and `results` is an empty list.
