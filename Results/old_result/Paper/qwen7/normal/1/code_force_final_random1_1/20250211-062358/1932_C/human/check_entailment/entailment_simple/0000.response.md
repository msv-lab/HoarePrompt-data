Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial State**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`. This matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the values based on the commands in `s`.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to traverse the array `a` from the start and end respectively.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the appropriate value (`a[l]` if 'L', `a[r]` if 'R') to `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
   - After the loop, `b` contains the elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`.

3. **Product Calculation**:
   - The function then calculates the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m` iteratively, storing each intermediate result in `ans`.
   - The product is updated using the formula `p = p * v % m` to ensure it does not overflow and remains within the bounds of `m`.
   - The results are stored in `ans` in reverse order because the loop processes the elements of `b` from the last added to the first added.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the required intermediate values of the product modulo `m` for each step in the process.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each command, updates the array `a` appropriately, and computes the required intermediate products modulo `m`.

Correctness: **True**
