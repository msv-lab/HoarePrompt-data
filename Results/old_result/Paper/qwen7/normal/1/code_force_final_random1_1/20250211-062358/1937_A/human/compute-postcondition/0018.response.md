Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 8.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is \(\log_2(n_{\text{cases}})\).
   - `power` is 4, and it is also equal to `n`.

2. **Determine the Value of `n`:**
   - Since `power` is 4, and `power` is equal to `n`, we have \( n = 4 \).

3. **Determine the Value of `n_cases`:**
   - Given \( n = \log_2(n_{\text{cases}}) \), we can solve for \( n_{\text{cases}} \):
     \[
     n_{\text{cases}} = 2^n = 2^4 = 16
     \]
   - This satisfies the condition that \( n_{\text{cases}} \) must be greater than 8.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - Since `power` is 4, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to \( 2^4 = 16 \).

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **16**
