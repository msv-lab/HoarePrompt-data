Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ad` will contain the differences between all consecutive elements of the updated list `a` starting from the second element to the last one. Specifically, `ad` will be `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, as the loop will continue until `i` reaches the length of `a`. All other variables (`l`, `m`, `ql`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ad` will store the differences between every pair of consecutive numbers in the list `a`, starting from the second element. The variable `i` will be set to the last index of the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2; `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3; `bd` is a list containing the values `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[3] - b[2]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4; `bd` is a list containing the values `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[3] - b[2]`, and `b[4] - b[3]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
