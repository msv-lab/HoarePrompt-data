Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of standard input after stripping and splitting, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`.**

Explanation: The code `grid.append(line)` appends the list `line` to the list `grid`. Initially, `grid` is an empty list. After executing this line of code, `grid` contains one element, which is `line`. All other variables remain unchanged.
