Given the initial state:
- `power` is equal to `n` - 1
- `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(2 ** power)`.

From the initial state, we know that `power` is set to `n - 1`. Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** (n - 1)`.

So, the print statement will output the result of `2 ** (n - 1)`.

Output: **2 ** (n - 1)**
