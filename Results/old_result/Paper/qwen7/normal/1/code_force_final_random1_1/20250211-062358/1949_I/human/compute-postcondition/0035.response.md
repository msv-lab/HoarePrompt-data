Output State: **`coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` remains unchanged, and `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `coef[i] = 1` changes the value of `coef[i]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet. Therefore, `coef[i+1]` is still set to 1, `tot` is still 0, `bipartite` remains unchanged, and `ok` is determined based on the conditions provided: it is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.
