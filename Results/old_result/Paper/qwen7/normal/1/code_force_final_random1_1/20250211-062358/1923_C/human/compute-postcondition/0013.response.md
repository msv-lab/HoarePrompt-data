Output State: **`x` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, and if `x` is 1, then `j` is increased by 1; `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial conditions, `j` is increased by 1 if `x` is 1. Since `x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1. Therefore, `c` now contains the value of `j`.
