Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either the first element of the first row in the gr matrix is not equal to the second element of the first row, or the first element of the last row in the gr matrix is not equal to the second element of the last row; `impossible` is False.**

The code `impossible = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `impossible`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `m`, or the conditions related to the `gr` matrix. Therefore, these conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
