Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of binary strings.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - For each test case, it collects the count of `1`s in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.

3. **Shape Determination:**
   - If all counts in `k` are the same, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Triangle Detection:**
   - The program checks if all counts in `k` are the same to determine if the shape is a square.
   - However, this approach does not correctly identify triangles.
   - A triangle would have counts like `[1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1]` for a triangle of size `k`, and an upside-down triangle would have counts like `[1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1]` but in reverse order.
   - The current logic only checks if all counts are the same, which is true for both squares and certain triangles (specifically, when the triangle is aligned such that all rows have the same number of `1`s).

2. **Square Detection:**
   - The program correctly identifies squares by checking if all counts are the same.
   - This is accurate because a square will always have the same number of `1`s in each row.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider some example grids:

- **Square:**
  ```
  111
  111
  111
  ```
  - Counts: `[3, 3, 3]`
  - Output: `SQUARE` (correct)

- **Triangle:**
  ```
  111
  11111
  1111111
  ```
  - Counts: `[3, 5, 7]`
  - Output: `TRIANGLE` (incorrect, should be `TRIANGLE` but the program might misidentify it as `SQUARE` if it doesn't account for the pattern correctly)

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly identify triangles because it only checks if all counts are the same, which is insufficient for identifying the specific patterns of triangles and squares.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program is **Incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
