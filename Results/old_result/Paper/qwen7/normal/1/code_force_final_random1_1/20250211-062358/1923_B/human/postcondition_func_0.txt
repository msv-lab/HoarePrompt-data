The function accepts three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `a` representing the health of the monsters, a list of integers `x` representing the initial positions of the monsters, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. It returns `True` if it can reduce the health of all monsters to zero using the given number of bullets per second, otherwise it returns `False`.
