Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the character `s[i]` is equal to '>', the length of `idx_A` is now 1 more than before, `x` is updated to either the new value of `i` and `idx_A` or the value of `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `A` has either one or two additional elements appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. This increases the length of `idx_A` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
