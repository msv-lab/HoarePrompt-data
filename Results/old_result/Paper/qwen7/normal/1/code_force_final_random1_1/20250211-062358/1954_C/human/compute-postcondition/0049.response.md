Output State: **`i` is 0; `len(a)` is a fixed value; `a[0] == b[0]` is true; `new[0]` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`, and both `a[0]` and `b[0]` are fixed values, `new[0]` will be set to the maximum of these two fixed values. All other conditions remain unchanged.
