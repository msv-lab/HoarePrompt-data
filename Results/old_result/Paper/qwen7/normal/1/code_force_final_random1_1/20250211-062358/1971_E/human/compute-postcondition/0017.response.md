Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(b))`. This means `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `b` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`. Therefore, `len(b)` must be greater than 2 (since `i` is currently 1 and will become 2).

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `b` must have at least 3 elements (since `i` will be 2 and `len(b)` must be greater than 2).
   - `bd` remains unchanged because it is based on the initial values of `b[1] - b[0]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `b` must have at least 3 elements, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`**.
