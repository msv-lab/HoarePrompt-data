Output State: **`i` is increased by the next element in `l` and equals the previous value of `i` plus the next element in `l`; `x` is the next element in `l`; `j` is increased by 1 if the next `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `l` is a non-empty list of integers; `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by the next `x`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

This means that the value of `i` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the next element in the list `l`. The value of `x` is set to the next element in `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise it remains unchanged. The lists `p` and `c` are updated to reflect the new value of `i` and the current value of `j`, respectively.
