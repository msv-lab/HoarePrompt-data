Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n and k, and a list a of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (the number of test cases), then for each test case, it receives two integers n and k, and a list a of n distinct integers. The function then performs some operation based on these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
