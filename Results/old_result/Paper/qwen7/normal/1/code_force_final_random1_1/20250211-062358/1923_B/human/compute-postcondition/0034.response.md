Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `distance`; `rest` is 0, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `distance += 1` increments the value of `distance` by 1. Initially, `distance` was 0, so after executing this line, `distance` becomes 1. The values of `pos`, `len(sorted_indices)`, `rest`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes `distance` being 1, while all other conditions and values remain as stated in the initial state.
