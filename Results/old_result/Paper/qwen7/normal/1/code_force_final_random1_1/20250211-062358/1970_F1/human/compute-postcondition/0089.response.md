Output State: **`ind` is `len(line)`, `i` is 1, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin` and updated to be the result of `stdin.readline().strip().split()`, `grid` is a list containing three elements where the third element is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary where for every non-`.` character in the new `line`, the key is the character and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in the new `line`**.

Explanation: The code `grid.append(line)` appends the `line` to the `grid`. Since `grid` was initially a list containing two elements (where the second element is the list `line`), after appending `line`, `grid` now contains three elements, with the third element being the list `line`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
