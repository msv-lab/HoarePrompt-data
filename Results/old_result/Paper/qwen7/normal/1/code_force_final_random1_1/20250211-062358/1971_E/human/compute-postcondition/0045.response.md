Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(int(m), end=' ')` will print the integer value of `m`.

To determine the value of `m`, we need to know the values of `b`, `bd`, `a`, `ad`, `s`, and `ql`. However, these values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express `m` in terms of these unknown variables.

Given the formula for `m`:
\[ m = b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \times (ql - a[s - 1])}{ad[s]} \]

Since the exact values of `b`, `bd`, `a`, `ad`, `s`, and `ql` are not specified, we cannot compute a numerical value for `m`. However, we can still describe what will be printed.

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])**
