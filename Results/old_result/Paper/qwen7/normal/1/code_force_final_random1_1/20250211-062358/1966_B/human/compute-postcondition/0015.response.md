Output State: **`tc` is 1, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `gr` is a list containing 4 elements which are the input values appended in each iteration with the first element not equal to the last element's first value, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True.**

Explanation: The line `impossible = True` sets the variable `impossible` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `tc`, `i`, `n`, `gr`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
