Postcondition: `i` is within the range [2, n], `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n`, `sb` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n` with `i` appended, and `sb` now has one more element which is `i`. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain 0.
