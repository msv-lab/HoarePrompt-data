You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be 0 because `m` is decremented in each iteration of the inner loop until it reaches 0. The variables `a` and `b` will contain the values from the last input pair of integers provided during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, which represents the count of 1s between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. The variable `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of elements between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i` will be evaluated for the last input pair, and either 'YES' or 'NO' will be printed based on the result. The lists `p` and `c` will be fully constructed based on the input sequence `l`, with `p` containing cumulative sums and `c` containing cumulative counts of 1s. Variables `j` and the input list `l` will remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `m` queries. Each query involves two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function calculates the sum of elements and the count of 1s within the specified range `[l_i, r_i]` in the list `c`. It then checks if the difference between the sum and the length of the range is greater than or equal to the count of 1s. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries for a test case, the function moves to the next test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of the elements in the subarray minus the count of 1s in the subarray is greater than or equal to the length of the subarray minus one. However, this logic is insufficient to ensure that the subarray can be transformed into another array \(b\) that meets all the required conditions.

To illustrate, consider the subarray \([1, 2, 1, 4, 5]\) from the example input. For the subarray \([1, 2, 1, 4, 5]\), the program would incorrectly determine it as "YES" because the sum of the subarray is 11, and the count of 1s is 2, which satisfies the condition \(11 - 2 \geq 5 - 1\). However, this subarray cannot be transformed into another array \(b\) where each element is different and positive, as required by the problem statement.

A correct solution would involve checking if the subarray can be transformed into an array where each element is different and positive, which is more complex than the current implementation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
