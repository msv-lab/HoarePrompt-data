Output State: **`nx` is 'F' concatenated with the original value of `nx`, `j` is within the range 3 to \( n \), \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24, and the conditions for `nx` remain the same.**

Explanation:
- The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the current value of `nx`.
- The value of `j` remains within the range 3 to \( n \) because it was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
- The conditions for `nx` remain the same because they depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `sb`, which are not modified by the code.
