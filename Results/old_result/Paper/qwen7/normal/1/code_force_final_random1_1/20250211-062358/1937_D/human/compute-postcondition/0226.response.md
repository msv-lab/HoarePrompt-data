Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)`, and `b` is the value of `B[r - 1] - B[r - l - 1] - (idx_B[r - l - 1] - 2) * (r - l - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to the current value of `b`. Given that `r` is decreased by 1, the term `B[r - l]` in the calculation of `b` changes to `B[r - l - 1]`. Therefore, the updated value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - l - 1] - (idx_B[r - l - 1] - 2) * (r - l - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
