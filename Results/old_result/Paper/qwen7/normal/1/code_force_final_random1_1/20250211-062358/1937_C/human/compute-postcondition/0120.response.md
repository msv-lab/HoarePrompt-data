Output State: **`best` is 1, `res` is '<', `i` is 1, `k` is `n-1`, and `n` is the input integer provided by the user.**

Explanation: The line `best = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `best`. All other variables (`res`, `i`, `k`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
