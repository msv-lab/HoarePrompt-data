Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `i` is iterated over each element in the list `s`.
   - After each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current element from `s`.
   - `s` is updated to be the list without its first element (if it originally had more than one element).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the second element of the list `s`.
   - `s` is the list without its first element.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take the value of the next element in `s`.
   - Since `i` is currently the second element, the next element would be the third element.
   - `s` will be updated to be the list without its first two elements.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will now be the third element of the updated list `s`.
   - `s` will be the list without its first two elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is the third element of the list `s`, and `s` is the list without its first two elements.**
