Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[i] * arr[i]`, `ans` is a list containing two elements: `tem` and `tem`, `ans` has had its second element appended with the value of `tem`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(tem)` appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contained `[tem]`, after appending `tem` again, `ans` now contains `[tem, tem]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
