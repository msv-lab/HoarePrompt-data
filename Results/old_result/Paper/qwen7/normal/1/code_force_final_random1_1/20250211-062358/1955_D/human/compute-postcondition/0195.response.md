Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - m - 1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state changes**: The loop body modifies `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans` based on certain conditions. However, these modifications are not relevant for determining the new state of `i` and `n` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was such that the condition `i < n - m` held true.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n - m`, `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The value of `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains the same.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a[i]` is an element of array `a`, `b_values` is a set of values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans` retain their previous values, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + m`**.
