Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`. The variable `elem` takes on the value of each element in `lst` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the initial state adjustments needed**:
   - **`mini`**: This variable contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. Since this value is already determined before the loop starts, no adjustment is needed for `mini`.
   - **`lst`**: The problem states that `lst` remains the same list as after the third iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst` has at least four elements (since the third iteration implies there are at least three elements, and the fourth one is being considered).
   - **`elem`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `lst` during each iteration. For the loop to start, `lst` must contain at least one element, but since we know it has at least four elements, we can ensure `elem` is set to the first element of `lst` for the first iteration.

4. **Final state adjustments**:
   - `mini`: No change needed.
   - `lst`: Ensure it has at least four elements.
   - `elem`: Set to the first element of `lst`.

Given these points, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `lst` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `elem` is the first element of `lst`.**
