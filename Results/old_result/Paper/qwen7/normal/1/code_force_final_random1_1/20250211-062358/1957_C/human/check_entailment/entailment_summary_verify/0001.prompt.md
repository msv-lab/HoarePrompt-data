You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
dp = [-1 for _ in range(300007)]
func_1(300000)
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    invalid = set([])
    for _ in range(k):
        (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
        invalid.add(r)
        invalid.add(c)
    print(max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]))

def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n+1` where `dp[i]` represents a specific value determined by the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. The function initializes `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3, then iteratively computes the values for `dp[i]` from 3 to `n`. After completing these calculations, the function returns the entire `dp` array, which contains the computed values up to `dp[n]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program sets a recursion limit and initializes a DP array `dp` to store intermediate results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

2. **Tracking Invalid Positions:**
   - A set `invalid` is used to keep track of positions where rooks cannot be placed due to existing rooks.
   - For each of the `k` moves, the program adds the row and column indices to the `invalid` set.

3. **DP Array Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates values for the DP array `dp` up to a maximum value (300000).
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For larger values, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

4. **Final Configuration Count Calculation:**
   - The number of valid positions left on the board is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The result is computed using the DP array: `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Base Cases and Recurrence Relation:**
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` seems to follow the combinatorial logic for counting configurations, but let's verify it:
     - For `i = 3`, `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * 2 * dp[1]) % 1000000007 = (3 + 8) % 1000000007 = 11`.
     - This matches the expected number of configurations for a 3x3 board without any restrictions.

2. **Handling Invalid Positions:**
   - The program correctly tracks invalid positions and uses them to compute the number of valid configurations.
   - The use of `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` ensures that the result is at least 1, even if no valid positions remain.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation `% 1000000007` is correctly applied to handle large numbers, ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid final configurations after the given moves. The base cases and recurrence relation are appropriate, and the handling of invalid positions is sound.

Correctness: **True**
