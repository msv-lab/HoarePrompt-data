Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers inputted separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then concatenates a list starting with `0` to the resulting list. This means `b` is now a list that starts with `0` followed by the integers inputted by the user, just like `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.
