Output State: **`command` is a list of three strings, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string from stdin using the `strip` and `split` methods and assigns the resulting list to the variable `command`. Then, it unpacks the list into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. Each of these variables now holds one of the elements from the `command` list. The initial state of `command` being a list of three strings remains unchanged, just now the individual elements are stored in `obj`, `com`, and `el`.
