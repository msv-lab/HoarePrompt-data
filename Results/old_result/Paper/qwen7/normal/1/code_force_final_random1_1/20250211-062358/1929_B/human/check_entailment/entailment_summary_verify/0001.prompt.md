You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, then checks if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`. If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function sets `t` to 0 and retains the values of `n` and `k` from the last test case, without further modification.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks if \( 4n - 2 \) equals \( k \). If it does, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - When \( 4n - 2 = k \), the formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) correctly gives the minimum number of cells needed because each diagonal must have at least one cell colored, and the grid can be optimally colored by ensuring every other row or column has a cell colored.
   - For other values of \( k \), \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) is used. This ensures that we color enough cells to cover at least \( k \) diagonals.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \neq 4 \), so \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \neq 3 \), so \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
     - \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \), so \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 6 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \):
     - \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \neq 9 \), so \( \lceil \frac{9}{2} \rceil = 5 \).

5. **General Case Verification:**
   - The logic handles both cases where \( k \) matches \( 4n - 2 \) and where it doesn't. The ceiling function ensures that we always get the minimum number of cells needed.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cells to color based on the conditions provided.
