Postcondition: `j` is 3, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` with a length greater than 1, and `test` is `False` if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`. If the difference between `lis[j]` and `lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1, then `test` remains `False`. If the difference is not greater than 1, `test` remains `False`.
