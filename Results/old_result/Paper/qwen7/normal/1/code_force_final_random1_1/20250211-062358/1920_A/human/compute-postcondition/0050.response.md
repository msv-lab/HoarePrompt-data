Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`, and `end` is equal to `v`. If `end` is greater than `v`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged.
