Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is the first integer from the input
   - `v` is the second integer from the input
   - `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input (`[v]`)
   - `start` is equal to `v`
   - `end` is equal to `v`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i` and `n`, we need to adjust these two variables.
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such specification is given, `n` stays the same.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `v`, `num`, `start`, and `end` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `t` is the first integer from the input
   - `v` is the second integer from the input
   - `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input (`[v]`)
   - `start` is equal to `v`
   - `end` is equal to `v`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`, and `end` is equal to `v`**.
