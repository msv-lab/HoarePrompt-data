Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a` starting from `a[1] - a[0]` up to `a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]`; `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The list `ad` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, starting from the second element of `a` down to the second last element of `a`. This means if `a` has `n` elements, `ad` will have `n-1` elements. The condition that `len(a)` must be greater than 1 ensures that there are at least two elements in `a` for the loop to run at all.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1; `b` must have at least 2 elements; `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `b` must have at least 3 elements, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`, `bd` is now a list containing `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[i] - b[i - 1]` which is `b[2] - b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `b` must have at least 3 elements, `bd` is a list containing `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[0]`, `b[3] - b[2]`, and `b[3] - b[2]` (i.e., `b[3] - b[2]` is appended)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
