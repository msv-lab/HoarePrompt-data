Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` correctly processes each test case one by one.
2. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".
4. It extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s`.
5. It handles the special case when `h` is '00' by printing '12'.
6. It checks if the hour is less than or equal to 12 and prints the hour as is if true.
7. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and formats it to ensure it has two digits.
8. It appends either 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour is 12 or greater.
9. The code follows the problem description accurately and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
