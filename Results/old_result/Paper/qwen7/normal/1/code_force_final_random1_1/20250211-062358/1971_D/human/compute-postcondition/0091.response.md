Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 4, `s` is a new input string, `count` is 2, `flag` is True (if the character at position `j` in string `s` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` is '1'), `j` is 0. If the character at position `j` in string `s` is not '0' or the character at position `j + 1` is not '1', then `flag` remains False.
