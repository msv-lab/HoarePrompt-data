Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and `final` is sorted; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50; `final` now contains an additional element `n`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was previously sorted and contained elements from `lst` that had the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, adding `n` to `final` means that `final` now includes `n`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
