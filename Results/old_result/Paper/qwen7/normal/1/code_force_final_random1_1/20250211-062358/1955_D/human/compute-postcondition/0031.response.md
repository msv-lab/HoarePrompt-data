Output State: **`i` is less than `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. It does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, or `curr`. The condition for updating `curr` (if `a[i+1]` is present in `b_values`) remains unchanged, so `curr` stays the same.
