Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts (C) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (B), but it does not account for the scenario where buying in pairs is cheaper than buying individually when the total number of yogurts is odd. 

For example, consider the case where \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 11 \). According to the problem description, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles (since \( 15 < 3 \times 5 \)). However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as \( \frac{3 \times 11}{2} = 16.5 \) (rounded down to 16), which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if the total cost of buying in pairs is less than the cost of buying individually, especially when the number of yogurts is odd.
