Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [0]
    c = [0]
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if x == 1:
            j += 1
        i += x
        p.append(i)
        c.append(j)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
        s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `m` will be 0, `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers inputted into the loop, `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i` will either hold true or false based on the inputs provided during the final iteration. If the condition holds true, 'YES' will be printed; otherwise, 'NO' will be printed.

This means that after all iterations, the value of `m` will have been decremented to 0 through the loop, and the variables `a` and `b` will contain the values from the last input pair. The variables `i` and `s` will reflect the difference in counts and sums calculated between the indices `a-1` and `b` as per the last iteration's inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `m` will be equal to the total number of times the loop has executed. The variables `a` and `b` will contain the last pair of integers input by the user. `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, which represents the count of 1s between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of elements between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. The lists `p` and `c` will be updated to include the cumulative sums and counts of 1s up to the last index `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `i` will hold the value `c[b] - c[a - 1]` for the last iteration's values of `a` and `b`. The variable `m` will be reduced by the number of times the loop has executed, so it will be less than or equal to 0. The variable `a` and `b` will hold the values provided in the last iteration of the loop. The variable `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]` for the last iteration's values of `a` and `b`. The variable `j` will remain unchanged from its initial state, as it is not affected by the loop. The list `p` will remain unchanged from its initial state, as it is not affected by the loop. The list `c` will remain unchanged from its initial state, as it is not affected by the loop.

In summary, after all iterations, `i` will reflect the count of 1s between the last `a` and `b`, `m` will be non-positive, and `a`, `b`, and `s` will hold the values from the last input pair.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
