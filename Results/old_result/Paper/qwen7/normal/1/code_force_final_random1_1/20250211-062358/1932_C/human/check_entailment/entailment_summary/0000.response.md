Reasoning:
1. The program correctly processes the input and initializes variables.
2. The function `func_1` constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`.
3. The variable `p` is used to compute the running product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`.
4. The results are stored in the list `ans` and returned in reverse order, which matches the requirement of the problem statement.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to follow the steps outlined in the problem description accurately. The function processes the commands in the correct order, updates the product modulo `m` appropriately, and returns the results in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
