Postcondition: `tree[current]` is not empty (excluding the previously processed `neighbor`), `visited` includes the previously processed `neighbor` and the new `neighbor` added by `visited.add(neighbor)`, and `queue` includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and possibly other tuples, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended to the queue if `neighbor` is not in `visited`.
