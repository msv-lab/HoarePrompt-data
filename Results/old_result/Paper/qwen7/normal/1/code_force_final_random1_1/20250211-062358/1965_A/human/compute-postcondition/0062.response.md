Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, and `test` is False.**

Explanation: The line `test = False` simply changes the value of the variable `test` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
