Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `k` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation using `bin(k)`, which includes the '0b' prefix. By slicing `[2:]`, we remove the '0b' prefix, resulting in `bk` being the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. The other variables (`b`, `l`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
