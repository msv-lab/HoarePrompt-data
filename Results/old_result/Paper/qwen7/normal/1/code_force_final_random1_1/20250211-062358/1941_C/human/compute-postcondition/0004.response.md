Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive; `s` is a string input by the user; `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

The code `y = s.count('pie')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns the result to the variable `y`. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
