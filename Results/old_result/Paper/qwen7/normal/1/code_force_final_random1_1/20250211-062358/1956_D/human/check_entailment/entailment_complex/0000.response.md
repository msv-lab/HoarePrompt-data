Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is responsible for setting a segment of the array to a specific value and recording the operation. It ensures that if the value at the start of the segment is not zero, it sets it to zero and records the operation. If the value at the start of the segment is not equal to the length of the segment, it sets all values in the segment to the length of the segment and records the operation. This function correctly handles the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array segments.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array and then returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves. The function `func_2` is correctly structured to handle the overall logic of maximizing the sum of the array using the operations defined.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function is designed to maximize the sum of any subarray defined by indices `l` and `r`. If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length, it sets all elements within the subarray to the subarray's length. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays before and after this maximum element. This function correctly implements the logic required to maximize the sum of the array.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the results along with the operations. It correctly handles the input and output as per the problem statement.

Given that each function performs its intended task correctly and the overall structure of the program aligns with the problem requirements, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
