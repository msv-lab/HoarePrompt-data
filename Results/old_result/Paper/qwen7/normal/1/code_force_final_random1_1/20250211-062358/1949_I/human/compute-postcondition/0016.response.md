Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `tot` is 0, all elements in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` remain as the integers entered by the user during the loop's iterations, the variable `n` remains unchanged and represents the original length of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`, the lists `visited` and `coef` remain as they were initially, with all elements set to `False` and `None`, respectively, and `ok` is False.**

The variable `ok` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except for the new assignment to `ok`.
