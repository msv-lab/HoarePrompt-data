Output State: **`x` is an array, `a[i]` is increased by 1, `a[j]` is increased by 1, `j` is `j_end + 1`, and `n` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increases the value of `a[j]` by 1. Initially, `a[j]` was unchanged, meaning its value remained the same as before. Now, it has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their original state as per the initial conditions.
