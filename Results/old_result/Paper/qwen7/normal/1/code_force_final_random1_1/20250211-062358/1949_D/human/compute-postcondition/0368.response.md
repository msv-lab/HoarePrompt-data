Output State: **`nx` is either 'SSF', 'FSF', 'SFF', or 'FFF', `j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 2) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'**.

Explanation: The value of `nx` is appended with 'F', changing its possible values from 'SS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'FF' to 'SSF', 'FSF', 'SFF', or 'FFF'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition about the character at position `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` also remains valid.
