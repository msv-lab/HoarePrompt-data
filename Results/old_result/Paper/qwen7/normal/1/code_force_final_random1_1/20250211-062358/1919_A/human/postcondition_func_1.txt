The function processes a specified number of test cases, where for each test case, it takes two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) as inputs. It calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner based on these inputs and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case. The final state of the program is that the variable `t` is set to 0, indicating all test cases have been processed, and the `results` list contains the outcomes of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case.
