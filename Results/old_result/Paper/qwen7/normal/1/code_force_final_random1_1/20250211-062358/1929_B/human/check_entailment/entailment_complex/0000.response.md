Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `k`.
3. The logic to determine the minimum number of cells to color is correct:
   - If `4 * n - 2 == k`, then the formula `k // 2 + 1` gives the correct result because each diagonal needs at least one cell, and since there are `4 * n - 2` diagonals, we need to color `(4 * n - 2) // 2 + 1` cells.
   - Otherwise, the formula `ceil(k / 2)` is used, which is also correct because it ensures that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
4. The program handles the constraints properly, as `t` is within the range `[1, 1000]` and `n` and `k` are within their specified ranges.
5. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is consistent with the problem statement, and no further modifications are made to `n` and `k`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
