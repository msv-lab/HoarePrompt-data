Functionality: **The function processes multiple lines of input, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and prints a value based on specific conditions. Specifically, if \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). If \( k = 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n - 1 \). If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \). The function continues this process for each line of input until all lines are processed.**
