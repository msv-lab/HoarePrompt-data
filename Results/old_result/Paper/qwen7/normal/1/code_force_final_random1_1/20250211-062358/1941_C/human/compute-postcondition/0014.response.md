Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `a` is reassigned to the value of an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning this new value to `a`. The other variables (`s`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
