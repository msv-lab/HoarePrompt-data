Output State: `b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration from `n - m` to `n - 1`.

In this final state, the loop has executed for all possible values of `i` starting from `n - m` up to `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `n - 1` after all iterations. For each value of `i` in this range, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1, meaning that the count of each `b[i]` in the `cnt_b` dictionary will reflect how many times each `b[i]` appeared in the specified range of `i` values.
