Output State: **`mex` is `n`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Here, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, so `res[len(ar) - 3]` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
