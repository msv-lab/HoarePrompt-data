Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input integer, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input from the `input()` function, `new` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values, `new2` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1; `x` is a string representing an integer and its first digit must match the first digit of `y`; `new2[0]` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `i + 1` (which is 3 since `i` was 2 or more), `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]` or the condition holds true for the next index, `new[i]` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new2[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 4, `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, `new[3]` is equal to `max(a[3], b[3])`, `new2[3]` is equal to `min(a[3], b[3])`, and `len(new2)` is greater than 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
