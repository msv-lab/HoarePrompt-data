Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(0, n)`. Therefore, the variables `i` and `n` are the ones that need to be considered for adjustment.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(0, n):` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `feat[1] - 1`, but its value during the first iteration of the loop is not directly relevant to the condition for the loop to execute. What matters is that `i` should be within the bounds of the range `range(0, n)`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `feat[1] - 1`, and the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is `feat[1] - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, array2 is an empty list**
