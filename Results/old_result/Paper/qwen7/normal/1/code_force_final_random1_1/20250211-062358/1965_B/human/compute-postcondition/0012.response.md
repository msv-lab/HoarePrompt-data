Output State: **`i` is 3, `l` must be at least 2, `ans` is [4, 8]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `2 ** i` equals 8. Therefore, `ans` changes from containing the value 4 to `[4, 8]`. The values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged.
