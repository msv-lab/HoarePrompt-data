The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a list `a` of length `n`, where the first element is set to 1000, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of 1000 plus the sum of all preceding elements in `x`. The function prints the list `a` for each test case.
