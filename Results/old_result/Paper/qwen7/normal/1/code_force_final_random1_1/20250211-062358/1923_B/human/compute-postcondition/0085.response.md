Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - 2*delta), `distance` remains unchanged, and `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`; `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The value of `delta` is updated to be the minimum between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
