The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `resultats`, or `total_matchs`.

Output State: **`p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.**
