Output State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since the initial values of `a` and `i` are not specified, the only thing we can say for certain is that `ad` now contains an additional element, which is the result of the subtraction `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
