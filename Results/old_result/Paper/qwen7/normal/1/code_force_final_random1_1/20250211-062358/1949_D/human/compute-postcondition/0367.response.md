Output State: **`nx` is either 'SSS', 'FSS', 'SFS', or 'FFS', `j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 2) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'**.

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to its current value. Since `nx` could initially be 'SS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'FF', after appending 'S', it becomes 'SSS', 'FSS', 'SFS', or 'FFS'. The values of `j`, `n`, and the condition about the character at position `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` remain unchanged.
