Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for all possible encoded values. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `n > 52`, the solution assumes the word should be of the form `[char][z][z]`. However, this is not always true. For example, for `n = 53`, the correct answer should be `"azz"` instead of `"bzz"`.
   - If `26 < n <= 52`, the solution assumes the word should be of the form `[a][char][z]`. Again, this is not always correct. For example, for `n = 30`, the correct answer should be `"azz"` instead of `"azz"`.
   - If `n <= 26`, the solution assumes the word should be of the form `[aa][char]`. This is generally correct but needs more detailed handling.

2. **General Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to ensure that we use the smallest possible letters while still matching the encoded value.
   - We should start with `'aaa'` and incrementally change the letters to match the required sum.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ['a', 'a', 'a']
        remaining = n - 3  # Subtract the initial 'aaa' which sums to 3
        
        for i in range(2, -1, -1):
            if remaining >= 26:
                word[i] = alphabet[25]
                remaining -= 26
            else:
                word[i] = alphabet[remaining]
                break
        
        print(''.join(word))

# Example usage:
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
- Initialize `word` as `['a', 'a', 'a']`.
- Calculate the remaining sum after subtracting the initial sum of `'aaa'` (which is 3).
- Iterate from the end of the word to the beginning, assigning the largest possible letter that fits into the remaining sum.
- Finally, join the list into a string and print it.

This approach ensures that the generated word is always lexicographically smallest.
