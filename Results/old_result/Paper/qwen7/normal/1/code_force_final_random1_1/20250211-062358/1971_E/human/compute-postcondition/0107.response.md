Output State: **`q` is `len(a)`, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` assigns the value of `bisect_left(a, ql)` to the variable `s`. The function `bisect_left` returns the index where the value `ql` should be inserted into the list `a` to maintain sorted order. The other variables (`q`, `l`, `m`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
