Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, `final` is now a list containing the element `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, and `lst` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` from `lst` to the list `final`. This means that `final` now contains all elements it previously had plus the new element `elem`. The value of `mini` and the condition that `lst` must contain at least one element remain unchanged.
