Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 8, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 3, and `power` is not equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The value of `power` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
