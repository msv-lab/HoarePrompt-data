Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. According to the game rules, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement this logic and handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
