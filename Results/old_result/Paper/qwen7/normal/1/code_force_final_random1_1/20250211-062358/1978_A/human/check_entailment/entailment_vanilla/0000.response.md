### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to divide the books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the maximum page count from each pile is maximized.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the highest page count from each pile.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which is the number of books.
   - It then reads `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book.
   - The solution prints the sum of the maximum page count from all but the last book (`max(nums[:-1])`) and the last book (`nums[-1]`).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the provided solution is flawed because it only considers the last book and the maximum of all other books, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the highest page counts from both piles.
   - For example, consider the test case where `nums = [2, 3, 3, 1]`. The solution would output `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal division would be to put books 2 and 3 in one pile and books 1 and 4 in another, resulting in `3 + 4 = 7`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this correctly, we should sort the list of pages and then place the largest element in one pile and the rest in the other pile. This ensures that the sum of the maximum elements from each pile is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not guarantee the optimal division of books into two piles to maximize the sum of the highest page counts from each pile.

### Correctness:
**False**
