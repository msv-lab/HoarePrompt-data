Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is the total length of the string `s` plus 1, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\), `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, and `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` initializes the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
