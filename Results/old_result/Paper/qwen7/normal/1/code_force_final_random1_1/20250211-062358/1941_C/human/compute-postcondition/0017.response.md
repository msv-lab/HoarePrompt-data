Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `y` is updated to the count of 'pie' in `s`.**

In this code, `y` is assigned the value of the count of the substring `'pie'` in the string `s`. The other variables (`a`, `s`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
