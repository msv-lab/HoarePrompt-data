Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces. If `B * 2 < C`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `B * 2 ≥ C`, and if `A` is an even integer, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `A` is an odd integer, then `X` is set to `A` divided by 2.
