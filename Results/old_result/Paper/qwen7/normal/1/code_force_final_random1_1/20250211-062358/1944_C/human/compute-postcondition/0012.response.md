Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is 0.
- `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 1`. This means that the first element of the `nums` list is decremented by 1.
- `vis` contains the element 0.
- `nums[start + 1]` is 0. Since `start` is 0, this means `nums[1]` (the second element of the `nums` list) is 0.

We need to determine what `start + 1` evaluates to and then print it.

1. `start` is explicitly given as 0.
2. Adding 1 to `start` gives us `start + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the print statement `print(start + 1)` will output the value 1.

Output: **1**
