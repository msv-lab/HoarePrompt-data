Output State: **`best` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string and its current value is '<'**

Explanation: The line `best = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `best`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `n` must be greater than `n-1` is still valid, and the value of `k` remains as `n-1`. The value of `res` remains as the input string '<'.
