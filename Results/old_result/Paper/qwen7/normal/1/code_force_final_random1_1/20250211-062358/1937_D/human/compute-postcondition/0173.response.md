Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is equal to `r - 1`, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is equal to `B[r] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)**

Explanation: The code `b = B[r]` assigns the value of `B[r]` to `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
