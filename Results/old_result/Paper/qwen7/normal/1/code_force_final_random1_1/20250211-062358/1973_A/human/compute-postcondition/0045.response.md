Output State: **`egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `egalites` using the formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `resultats`, and `total_matchs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
