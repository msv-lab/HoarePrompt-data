Output State: **`a` is an updated list, num_iterations is num_iterations - 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer using map and int functions.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `x`. The initial state of `a` and `num_iterations` remains unchanged, and `n` remains as an input integer.
