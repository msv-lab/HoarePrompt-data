To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`command`**: This is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin.
2. **`obj`**: This is the first element of `command`.
3. **`com`**: This is the second element of `command`.
4. **`pos`**: This is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.
5. **`nxt`**: This is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element.
6. **`player`**: This is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True else `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

Given the format of the print statement, we need to know the values of `time` and `player`:

- **`time`**: This is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it must be a variable that holds a numeric value.
- **`player`**: This depends on the value of `obj` and the result of `isPlayer(obj)`. If `isPlayer(obj)` is True, then `player` is `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Since the exact values of `time`, `obj`, `com`, `elements`, `mov`, `isPlayer`, and `grid` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **%d [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is either obj if isPlayer(obj) is True, or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] otherwise, and %d is the value of time)**
