### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summaries.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Sorting Based on Distance**:
   - The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distances from the origin (0). This ensures that the closest monsters are handled first, which is crucial because the player must kill monsters before they can move closer.

2. **Iterating Through Sorted Indices**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted indices and tries to kill the monsters. For each group of monsters at the same distance from the origin, it checks if they can be killed before moving closer.
   - It uses the available bullets (`k`) to reduce the health of the monsters. If a monster's health is reduced to zero, it is considered killed, and the player moves on to the next group of monsters.

3. **Checking if a Monster Can Be Killed**:
   - The function checks if a monster can be killed before it reaches the player by ensuring that the player has enough bullets to reduce its health to zero before it moves.
   - If a monster cannot be killed before it reaches the player, the function immediately returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as when there are no bullets left or when a monster is already dead.
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where the player cannot kill all monsters before they reach the player.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters (`n`) and the number of bullets (`k`).
   - It then reads the healths of the monsters (`a`) and their positions (`x`).

2. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - The function calls `func_1` with the read inputs and prints `YES` if the player can survive, otherwise `NO`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Sorting Based on Distance**:
   - The sorting step ensures that we handle monsters closest to the player first, which is crucial because the player must kill monsters before they can move closer.

2. **Killing Monsters**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted indices and tries to kill monsters using the available bullets.
   - It correctly handles the case where multiple monsters are at the same distance from the player and ensures that enough bullets are used to kill them before they move closer.

3. **Checking if a Monster Can Be Killed**:
   - The function checks if a monster can be killed before it reaches the player by ensuring that the player has enough bullets to reduce its health to zero before it moves.
   - If a monster cannot be killed before it reaches the player, the function immediately returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as when there are no bullets left or when a monster is already dead.
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where the player cannot kill all monsters before they reach the player.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the functions, it appears that the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` is correct according to the problem statement. The function correctly determines whether the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
