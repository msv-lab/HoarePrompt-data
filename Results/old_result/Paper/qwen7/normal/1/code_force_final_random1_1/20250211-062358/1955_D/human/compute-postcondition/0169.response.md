Output State: **`i` is in the range [0, n - m - 1], `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is increased by 1, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increases the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `curr` is now one more than its previous value, while `i`, `a`, `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` (which is decremented but still needs to be greater than or equal to 0) retain their original conditions.
