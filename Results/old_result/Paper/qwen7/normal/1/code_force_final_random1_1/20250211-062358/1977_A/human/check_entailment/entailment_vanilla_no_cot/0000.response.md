Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the logic for determining whether it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves needs refinement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Case `m > n`:** The current implementation correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to add more cubes than the number of moves.
2. **Case `m == n`:** This is correctly handled by printing "Yes".
3. **Case `m < n`:** The current implementation checks if `m` is `n-1`, which is too restrictive. It should check if `abs(m - n)` is even because every move either adds or removes one cube, and the difference between the final and initial number of cubes must be even.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif abs(m - n) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

```

This version correctly handles all cases where it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves by ensuring the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
