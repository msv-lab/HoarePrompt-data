Output State: **The program returns a reversed list `ans` which contains all intermediate values of `p` computed during each iteration of the loop in reverse order.**

This means that the function returns a list `ans` that includes all the intermediate values of `p` (which is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`) from the last computed value back to the first one, effectively reversing the order of these intermediate values.
