Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be at least 2; `j` is 1; `a[i]` is increased by 1; the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F'.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` which was not previously defined, is now increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
