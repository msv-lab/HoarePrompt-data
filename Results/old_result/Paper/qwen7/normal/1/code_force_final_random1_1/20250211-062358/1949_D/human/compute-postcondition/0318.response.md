Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**

Explanation: The code appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing `nx += 'F'`, `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and the condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
