Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, and there exists at least one valid permutation p that satisfies the given conditions.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = [None] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        if mex > mex - ar[i]:
            mex = mex - ar[i]
    print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `mex` will be 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is calculated as `n - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `i` will be `-1` (though this value is not used outside the loop).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `-1`, `mex` remains unchanged if it was never updated to a value greater than `mex - ar[i]` during any iteration, and each element in `res` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` where `i` ranges from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `-1`, `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`, and `ar` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will become `-1` because the loop decrements `i` starting from `len(ar) - 1` until it reaches `-1`. The value of `mex` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is only modified within the if condition which does not alter `mex` if the condition is false. The list `res` is filled such that for each index `i`, `res[i]` equals `mex - ar[i]`. The list `ar` remains unaltered as it is not modified within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
