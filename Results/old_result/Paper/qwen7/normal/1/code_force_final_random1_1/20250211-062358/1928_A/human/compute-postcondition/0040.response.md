Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. It checks specific conditions related to the parity of `a` and `b`, and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on these conditions. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
