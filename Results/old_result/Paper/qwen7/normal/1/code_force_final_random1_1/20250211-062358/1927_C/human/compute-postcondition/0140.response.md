Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `k + 1`
- `bOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in both `a` and `b` up to `k`
- `aOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in `a` up to `k`, adjusted based on the comparison with `bOnes` and the condition involving `newk`
- `k` retains its original value
- `newk` is updated to `k // 2`
- The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true

Given that the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true, it means that both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.

The print statement is simply `print('yes')`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **yes**
