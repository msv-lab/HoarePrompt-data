Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces and converted to integers, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
