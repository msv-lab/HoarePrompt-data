Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, 'n' is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, followed by 'n' non-negative integers 'a_1, a_2, ..., a_n' each less than 'n'. The function returns data based on this input.**
