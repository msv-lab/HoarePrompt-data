Postcondition: `time` is the previous value of `time` + 1, `comand` is an empty list, `obj` is unchanged, `com` is an undefined variable, `pos` is equal to `nxt`, and `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. If the player is identified (`isPlayer(obj)` returns true), then `pos` is updated to `nxt`.
