Output State: **`total` is 0 + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is 10, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is the current value of `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and the cost of swapping (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost of passing (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**

This means that the `total` variable has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its initial value of 0. All other variables retain their original conditions and constraints.
