Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, and `smin[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. This does not change the values of `i` or `n`, nor does it affect the relationship between `smin[i + 1]` and `smin`. Therefore, the updated state includes the appended value to `smin`.
