Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (the starting point of the range).
   - `n` is a variable that defines the upper limit of the range.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 1, so the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to 1 initially, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other states**:
   - The states of `idx`, `total`, `t`, `results`, `mp`, `a`, and `pf` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
