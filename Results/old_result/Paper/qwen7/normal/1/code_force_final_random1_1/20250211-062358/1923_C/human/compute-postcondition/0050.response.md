Output State: **`m` is `m - 2`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `m` is still `m - 2`, and the expressions for `i` and `s` remain as they were initially defined.
