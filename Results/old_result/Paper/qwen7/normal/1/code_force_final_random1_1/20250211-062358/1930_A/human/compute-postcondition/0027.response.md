Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
   ```
   The only variable mentioned here is the loop counter, which is an underscore `_`. However, since the underscore is a placeholder and does not hold a specific name or value, we need to focus on how the loop affects other variables.

2. **Understand the Loop Body Impact**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the description, the loop is iterating a number of times equal to the integer input from the user. Each iteration of the loop seems to be adding elements from the list `l` at even indices to the variable `score`.

3. **Determine the Final State After All Iterations**: After all iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `2 * n - 1`, where `n` is the number of iterations. This indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: Since the loop is controlled by the input value, the number of iterations `n` is determined by the user input. For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be incremented by 1.

5. **Update the States**:
   - The variable `i` will be `2 * n - 1` after completing all iterations.
   - The variable `score` will be the original value plus the sum of elements at even indices up to `2 * (n - 1)`.

Given that the loop is controlled by the user input, let's denote the current input value as `k`. After the loop completes, `n` would be `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1, making `n` equal to `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `2 * (k + 1) - 1 = 2 * k + 1`.
- `score` will be the original value plus the sum of elements at even indices up to `2 * k`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2 * (input + 1) - 1, `score` is the original `score` plus the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (input - 1).**
