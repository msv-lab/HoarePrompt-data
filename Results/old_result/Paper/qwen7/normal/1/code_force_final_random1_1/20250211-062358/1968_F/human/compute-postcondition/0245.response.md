Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is updated to the list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is retrieved again from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` now contains 'YES' and 'NO', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index of the element in `v1` which is just greater than or equal to `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends 'NO' to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged with their previous values or expressions.
