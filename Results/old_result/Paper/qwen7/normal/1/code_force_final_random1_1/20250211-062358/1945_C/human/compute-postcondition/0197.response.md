Output State: **`i` is 3, `zero` is either 3 or 2, `zero_perc` is 60, `one_perc` is -66.67, and `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates `one_perc` based on the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. However, since `o` and `n` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. But we know that `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'. Since `i` is 3, the value of `s[3]` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `one`. The other variables remain unchanged.
