Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1.**

In the given code snippet, `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `x` is the first element of `l` and its value is 1, and no other changes are made to `l` or `x`, the output state remains as described.
