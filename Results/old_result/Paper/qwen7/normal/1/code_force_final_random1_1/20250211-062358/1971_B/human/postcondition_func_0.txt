The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints either the lexicographically sorted version or the reverse-sorted version of the unique characters in `s`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
