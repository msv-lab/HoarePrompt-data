Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The variables that affect the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 3
   - `n` is at least 15
   - `m` is at least 10
   - `y` is 3
   - `cnt` is 1 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition, it doesn't need to be adjusted)

4. **Check the loop condition with current values**:
   - Substitute the current values into the loop condition: `(3 + 3) * 3 <= n and (3 + 3) * 3 <= m`
   - Simplify: `6 * 3 <= n and 6 * 3 <= m`
   - Further simplify: `18 <= n and 18 <= m`

5. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, either `n` must be greater than 18 or `m` must be greater than 18 (or both).

Given that `n` and `m` are both at least 15, but the loop condition requires them to be at least 18, we need to adjust `n` and/or `m` to be greater than 18.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `m` to ensure they are greater than 18.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 3, `n` is at least 19, `m` is at least 19, `y` is 3**
