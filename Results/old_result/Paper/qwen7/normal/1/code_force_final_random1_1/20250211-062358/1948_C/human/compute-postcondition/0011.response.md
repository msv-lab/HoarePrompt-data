Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `step` is 2.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n, 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by `2` each iteration (since the step is `2`).

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < n`.
   - Additionally, the loop breaks if either:
     - `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'`
     - `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`

5. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently `1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

6. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - The condition `i + 1 < n` becomes `3 + 1 < n` or `4 < n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than `4` for the loop to continue.

7. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be `3`.
   - `n` must be greater than `4`.

8. **Other Variables:**
   - `step` remains `2`.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 3, `step` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of characters.**
