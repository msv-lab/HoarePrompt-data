Output State: **`ss` is the first character of the string `s`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `cur_ss`, `ans` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code calculates the ASCII value of the first character of the string `ss` (denoted as `ss`) and subtracts the ASCII value of the character 'a'. This difference is stored in the variable `cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
