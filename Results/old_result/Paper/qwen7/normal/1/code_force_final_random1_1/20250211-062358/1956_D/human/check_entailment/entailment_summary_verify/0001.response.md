### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program based on the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, where each operation sets a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray.

2. **Function Summaries Recap:**
   - `func_4` reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - `func_2` is supposed to return the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - `recursive_maximize_sum` is supposed to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.

3. **Analysis of Functions:**

   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function is supposed to set the elements in a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray.
     - The function is incorrectly named and does not handle the MEX calculation properly.
     - It has a logical error in its base case, where it tries to set `a[l]` to 0 if `a[l]` is not 0, but it does not handle the MEX value correctly.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but does not pass the `ops` list, making it difficult to track the operations performed.
     - It returns the sum of the array and the number of operations, but the logic to maximize the sum is flawed.

   - **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
     - This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
     - It checks if the current sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\). If true, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to the MEX value.
     - However, the MEX calculation is missing, and the function does not correctly handle the recursive calls to maximize the sum.

   - **Function `func_3`:**
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
     - The issue lies in the implementation of `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, which do not correctly maximize the sum of the array.

4. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The MEX calculation and the recursive approach are not correctly handled, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as stated. The MEX calculation and the recursive approach are not correctly handled, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly maximize the sum of the array.
