Postcondition: `custo` is increased by either `a_values[num_fila - 2]` or `b_values[num_fila - 2]` depending on whether `a_values[num_fila - 2]` is less than `b_values[num_fila - 2]`. Specifically, if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`. Additionally, `num_fila` must be greater than or equal to `max_p`.
