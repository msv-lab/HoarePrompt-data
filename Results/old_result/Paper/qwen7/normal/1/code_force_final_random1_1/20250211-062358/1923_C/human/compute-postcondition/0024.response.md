Postcondition: **`i` is increased by the next element in `l`, `x` is the next element in `l`, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `j` is increased by 1 if the next `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by the next `x`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**
