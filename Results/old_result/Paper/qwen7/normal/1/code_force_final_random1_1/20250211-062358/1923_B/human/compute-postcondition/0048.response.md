Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` to the variable `delta`. Since `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` are not defined in the initial state, `delta` is initialized with the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The values of `distance` and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial states.
