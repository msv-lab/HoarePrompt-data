Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and the i-th element is updated to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and the i-th element is updated to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `i`-th element of `new2` to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `i` was previously less than `len(a)` and equals `i + 1`, it remains the same. The `new` list and `new2` list are updated according to their respective rules, but no new information about their contents is provided except that the `i`-th element of `new2` is now the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
