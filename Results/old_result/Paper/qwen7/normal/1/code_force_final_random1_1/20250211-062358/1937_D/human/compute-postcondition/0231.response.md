Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `r` are updated as described. Specifically, `r` is decreased by 1.
