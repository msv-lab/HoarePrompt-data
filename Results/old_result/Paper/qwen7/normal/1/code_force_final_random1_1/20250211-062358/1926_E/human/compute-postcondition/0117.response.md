Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is 2
- `L` is a list `[0, 1]`

However, the variables `pow`, `k`, and `tot` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their values directly from the given information. Since these variables are necessary to evaluate the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, and their values are not provided, we must express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)**
