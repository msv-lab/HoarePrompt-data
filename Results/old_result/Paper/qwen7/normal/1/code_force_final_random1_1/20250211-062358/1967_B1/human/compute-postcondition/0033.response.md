`count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `countmins` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 3) / 3) + 1 + int(int(n / 4) / 4)`, `g` is `int(n / 4)` - 3.

Output State: **`countmins` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 3) / 3) + 1 + int(int(n / 4) / 4)`, `g` is `int(n / 4)` - 3.**
