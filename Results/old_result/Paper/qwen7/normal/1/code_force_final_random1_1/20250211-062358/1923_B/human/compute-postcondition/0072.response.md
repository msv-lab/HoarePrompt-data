Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` - `delta`) - `delta`, `distance` remains unchanged, `pos` remains unchanged, and `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`. Therefore, the value of `rest` is updated to `k - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta) - delta`. The other variables remain unchanged.
