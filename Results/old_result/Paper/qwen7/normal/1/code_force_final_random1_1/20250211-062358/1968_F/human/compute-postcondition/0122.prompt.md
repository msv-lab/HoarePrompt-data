Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is equal to `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a`, `x` is not defined, `v1` is not defined, `v2` is not defined, `results` is now appended with an empty string, `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` becomes `[i]` if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3, `x`, `v1`, and `v2` are not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` is `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, `mp[pf[i]]` is appended with `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` is `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 4, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is appended with `i`, `pf[i]` is updated to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list; `mp[pf[i]]` is updated to include `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
