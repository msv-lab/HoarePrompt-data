Output State: **`v` is -3, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, `best` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]` depending on whether `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]`, and `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-3]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop decremented `v` from `-2` to `-3`.
- `total` was previously increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`.
- Now, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-3]`.
- `v` is now `-3`.
- `na_frente` remains unchanged and must be greater than `-1`.
- `best` is updated based on the previous conditions.
