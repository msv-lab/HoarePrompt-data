The loop head is defined by the condition `tc > 0`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `tc` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `tc` is equal to `tc` - 1
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1
- `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element
- `dp` is the result of applying the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` iteratively from `i = 1` to `i = n-1

Since the loop condition is `tc > 0`, we need to ensure that `tc` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. Given that `tc` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `tc` is `tc - 1`.

For the loop to continue, `tc` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `tc` is at least 1 (since `tc` was decremented by 1).

State: **`tc` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element, `dp` is the result of applying the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` iteratively from `i = 1` to `i = n-1**
