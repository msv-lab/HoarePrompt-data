Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `n - m` must be at least 1; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; `curr` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. Therefore, `curr` is incremented by 1, while `i`, `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `ans`, and the condition for `ans` being incremented remain as they were.
