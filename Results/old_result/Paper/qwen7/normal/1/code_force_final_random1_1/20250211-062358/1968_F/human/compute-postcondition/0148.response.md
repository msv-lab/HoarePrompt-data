Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `idx` is increased by 4, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`, `l` is updated to an integer value from `data[idx]`, `results` is appended with 'YES'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the conditions and values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2` remain unchanged, and `results` now includes the string `'YES'`.
