t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); n, k, and q are positive integers such that \(k \leq n \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5\); a is a strictly increasing list of k integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and \(a_k = n\); b is a strictly increasing list of k integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i < b_{i+1}\) for every \(1 \leq i \leq k-1\); d is a list of q integers where \(0 \leq d \leq n\).
