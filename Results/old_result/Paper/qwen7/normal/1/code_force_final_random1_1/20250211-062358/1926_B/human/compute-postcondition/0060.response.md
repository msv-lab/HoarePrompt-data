Output State: **`b` is an input string from the user**.

The code `b = input()` assigns the input string from the user to the variable `b`. Since the initial state mentions that `b` is the input string from the user, after executing the code, `b` will hold the string input provided by the user. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
