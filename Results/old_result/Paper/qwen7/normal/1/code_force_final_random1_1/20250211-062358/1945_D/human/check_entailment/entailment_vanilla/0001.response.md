Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to help Kirill minimize the cost of moving to one of the first `m` positions in a queue.
- For each position `i`, we have two costs:
  - `a_i`: Cost to swap with the person at position `i`.
  - `b_i`: Cost for each person between `i` and the current position `j` (`j < i`) when swapping.
- Kirill wants to be in one of the first `m` positions in the queue.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `m`.
   - It then reads the arrays `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `na_frente` is set to `n - 1` (number of people in front of Kirill).
   - `pos_final` is set to `m - 1` (maximum allowable final position).
   - `total` is initialized to 0.
   - `best` is initialized to a large value (`10 ** 12`).

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to `-1` (backwards through the positions).
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the allowed range (`v <= pos_final`):
       - Update `best` if the current total plus `a_v` is less than the current `best`.
       - Choose the cheaper option between `a_v` and `b_v` to update `total`.
     - If `v` is beyond the allowed range:
       - Add the cheaper option between `a_v` and `b_v` to `total`.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Correctness Check
- The logic correctly handles the backward iteration through the positions.
- The `best` variable is updated to store the minimum cost to reach a position within the allowed range.
- The choice between `a_v` and `b_v` is made correctly based on the problem constraints.
- The program outputs the correct result for each test case.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
The program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
