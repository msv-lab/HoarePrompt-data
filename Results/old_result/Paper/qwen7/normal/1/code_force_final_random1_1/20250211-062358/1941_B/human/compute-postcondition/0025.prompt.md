Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the list. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1
        ] + 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The first element of `b` is either an odd number and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is an odd number and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. Otherwise, the first element of `b` is an even number or the second element equals the first element plus 2, and the last element of `b` is an even number or the second last element equals the last element plus 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the split input string. If the first element of `b` is an odd number and does not differ from the second element by 2, or if the last element of `b` is an odd number and does not differ from the second last element by 2, then the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they are.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter and converting each element to integer. If the first element of `b` is odd and does not differ by 2 from the second element, or if the last element of `b` is odd and does not differ by 2 from the second last element, the condition is met. In all cases, `t` remains greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, and `b` remains a list of integers as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
