Output State: The final value of `custos` is a list containing the total accumulated cost `custo` after the loop has executed for all iterations. This total cost is calculated based on the conditions provided within the nested loops, where for each iteration, the loop processes the values in lists `a_values` and `b_values` according to the specified rules to compute `custo`. Once all iterations are complete, `custo` reflects the sum of all individual costs computed during each iteration, and `custos` contains this final cumulative cost as its sole element.

In more detail, `custos` will contain a single integer representing the total cost accumulated over all iterations of the loop, where each iteration processes a different set of input values for `num_fila` and `max_p`, along with corresponding lists `a_values` and `b_values`.
