Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`, and `end` is equal to `v`. The condition remains unchanged regardless of the value of `t` since there is no modification inside the if block and no else part to consider.**
