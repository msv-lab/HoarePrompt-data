Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables:**
   - The loop iterates over a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: `l` and `r`.
   - The loop head variables are `(l, r)`.

2. **Determine Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are tuples left in the `ops` list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ops` must contain at least one tuple.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop continues based on the presence of tuples in the `ops` list, we need to ensure that `ops` still contains at least one tuple for the next iteration.
   - The loop will pick the first tuple from the `ops` list and assign its elements to `l` and `r`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still contain at least one tuple. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `ops` contains at least one tuple.

### Final Answer:

State: **`ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple**
