Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'az'**.

Explanation: The code appends the characters 'a', the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and 'z' to the string `word`. Given that `n` is an input integer, the exact character from `alphabet` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `n`. However, since the initial state of `word` is an empty string, after the operation, `word` becomes 'az'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
