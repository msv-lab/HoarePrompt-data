Output State: **`ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is less than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
