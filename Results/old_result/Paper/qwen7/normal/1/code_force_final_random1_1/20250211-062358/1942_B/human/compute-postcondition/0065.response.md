Postcondition: `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` remains unchanged and `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change from the if part.
