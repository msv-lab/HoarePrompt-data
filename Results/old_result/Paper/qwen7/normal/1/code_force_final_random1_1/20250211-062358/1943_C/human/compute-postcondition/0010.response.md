Output State: **`u2vs[u]` is a list containing `v`, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing both `u` and the original value of `v`, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is an integer which is 1 less than the original input integer `u`.**

Explanation: The value of `u` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions and the structure of the lists `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` remain intact, except for the value of `u` itself, which is now one less than its original value.
