### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - If `n == m`, it means we can simply add 1 cube per move, so the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible because we can't add more cubes than the total number of moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it means we added 1 cube `n-1` times and removed 1 cube once, which is possible.
   - The conditions `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` check if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd. This is necessary because adding and removing cubes alternately must maintain the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of cubes.

3. **Reviewing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly checks all the conditions mentioned above.
   - However, there is a critical oversight in the logic for handling the condition `m > n`. The current implementation does not account for the possibility that `m` can be less than `n` but still achievable through a combination of adding and removing cubes.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle the case where `m < n` and the difference between `n` and `m` is an even number. This is because we can always achieve `m` cubes by making a series of additions and removals that result in the net effect of reducing the number of cubes by the difference between `n` and `m`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Case Analysis:**
  - **Case 1:** `n == m`
    - Correctly prints "Yes".
  - **Case 2:** `m > n`
    - Incorrectly prints "No". This case should be handled by checking if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, as we can always achieve `m` cubes by making a series of additions and removals that result in the net effect of reducing the number of cubes by the difference between `n` and `m`.
  - **Case 3:** `m == n - 1`
    - Correctly prints "Yes".
  - **Case 4:** `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`
    - Correctly prints "Yes".
  - **Case 5:** `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`
    - Correctly prints "Yes".
  - **Case 6:** `m < n` and the difference is even
    - Incorrectly prints "No". This case should be handled by checking if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.

### Corrected Logic:

To fix the issue, we need to add a condition to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even when `m < n`.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
                print('Yes')
            else:
                print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `m < n` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even. The corrected logic should include this condition.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
