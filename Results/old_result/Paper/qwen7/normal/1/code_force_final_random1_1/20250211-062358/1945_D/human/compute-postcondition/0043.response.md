Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v = v - 1`, `na_frente` is an integer (unchanged), `pos_final` is an integer (unchanged), `best` is an integer (unchanged), and `total` is an integer that is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The variable `v` is updated to `v - 1` as per the initial state, and `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `pos_final`, `best`, and `total`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
