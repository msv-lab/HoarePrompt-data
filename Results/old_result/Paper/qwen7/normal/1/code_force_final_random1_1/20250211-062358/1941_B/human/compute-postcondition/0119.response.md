Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `4`, `opNum` is `a[3]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - 2 * opNum - opNum - opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - opNum`, `a[4]` is `a[4] - 2 * opNum`**

Explanation: 
- The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` updates the value of `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[4]` since `i` is `3`) by subtracting `2 * opNum` from its current value.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from `3` to `4`.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
