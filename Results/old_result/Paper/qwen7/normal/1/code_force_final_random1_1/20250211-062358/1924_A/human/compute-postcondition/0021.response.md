Output State: **`cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 1, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is the first character of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the value `1` to the left by `cur_ss` positions and adds it to the current value of `cur`. Since `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `1 << cur_ss` results in a number with a `1` in the `cur_ss`-th position and `0`s elsewhere. This value is then added to `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.
