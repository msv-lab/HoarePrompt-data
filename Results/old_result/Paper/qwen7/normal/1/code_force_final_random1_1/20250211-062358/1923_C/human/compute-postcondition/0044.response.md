Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

The code `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]` does not change the values of any variables except for `i`. It simply reassigns the value of `i` to be the same as its previous definition, which is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. Therefore, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `i` remain the same as their initial states.
