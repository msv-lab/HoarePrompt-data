Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in l:`. This means the variable `x` is being iterated over the list `l`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2 + x
   - `j` is 3
   - `p` is [2, 2 + x]
   - `c` is [2, 3]

3. **Understand how the loop affects the variables**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`. For each iteration, the value of `x` changes to the next element in the list `l`.
   - Since `i` is defined as `2 + x`, when the loop starts again, `x` will be updated to the next element in `l`, and consequently, `i` will be updated to `2 + x`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be updated to `2 + x`, where `x` is now the next element in the list `l`.
   - `j` remains unchanged at 3.
   - `p` will be updated to `[2, 2 + x]`, where `x` is now the next element in the list `l`.
   - `c` remains unchanged at [2, 3].

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 2 + (next element in l), `j` is 3, `p` is [2, 2 + (next element in l)], `c` is [2, 3]**
