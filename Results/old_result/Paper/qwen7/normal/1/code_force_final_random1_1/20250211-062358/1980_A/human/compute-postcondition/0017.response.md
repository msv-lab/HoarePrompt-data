Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `prob` which is iterated over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `a` is an empty list or contains elements.
   - `freq` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `missing` is calculated based on the values in `freq`.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `missing`.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned from `test_cases[_]`.

3. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `a` is not empty. Therefore, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`freq`, `missing`, `results`, `t`, `n`, `m`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
