Output State: **The final value of `score` will be the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element and going up to the last element in steps of 2.**

Natural Language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `2 * n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `score` will contain the sum of elements from the list `l` at even indices, specifically `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2 * (n - 1)]`. The list `l` remains unchanged, and the final value of `score` will be the sum of these elements.
