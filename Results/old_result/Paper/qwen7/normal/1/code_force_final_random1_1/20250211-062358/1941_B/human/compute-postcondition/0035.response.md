Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 4; `opNum` is 0; `a[i]` is `a[2]`; `a[i + 1]` is `a[3] - 0` or simply `a[3]`**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` updates the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting `2 * opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is 0, the operation simplifies to `a[i + 1] -= 0`, which means `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3, so `a[3]` remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions remain the same as the initial state.
