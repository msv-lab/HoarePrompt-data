Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `ele` which iterates over the elements in `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is iterating over `lst`, at the end of each iteration, `ele` takes the next element from `lst`.
   - For the loop to continue, `lst` must still contain at least one element.
   - The value of `mini` is updated based on the current `ele`, but it does not affect the loop continuation condition directly.

5. **Update the state**:
   - After the previous iteration, `lst` must have at least one element.
   - For the next iteration, `lst` must have at least two elements (since one element has already been processed).
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value, but the specific value of `mini` is not relevant for determining if the loop can continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `lst` must have at least two elements.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must contain at least two elements**
