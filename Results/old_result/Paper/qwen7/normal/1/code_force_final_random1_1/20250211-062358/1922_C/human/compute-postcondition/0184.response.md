Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `x` and the second input to `y`. The initial conditions for `m` and `j` remain unchanged.
