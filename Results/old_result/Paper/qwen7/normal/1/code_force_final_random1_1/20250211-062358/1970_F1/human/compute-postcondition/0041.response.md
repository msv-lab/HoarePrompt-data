Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`, `ind` is set to `line[len(line) - 1] + 1`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and in both cases (`isPlayer(line[ind])` being `True` or `False`), `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to its existing contents; `elements[line[ind]]` is set to the tuple `(i, ind)`, and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to its existing contents.**
