Output State: **`q` is `len(a) - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `1`, `m` is `0`, `i` is `1`, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `ql` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value entered by the user. The other variables (`q`, `l`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
