Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of non-negative integers. Each integer in the list satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and the length of the list is \(n\) (i.e., 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The function does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.**
