Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range of `m`. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: According to the given information, `i` is set to `k + 1` at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `range(m)`, meaning `0 <= i < m`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `i` starts at `k + 1` and the loop will increment `i` by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `k + 2`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `0 <= i < m`, so `k + 2` must still be within this range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `curr` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k + 2`, and if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**
