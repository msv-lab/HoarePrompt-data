Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', `b[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Since `i` is 1, `b[1]` is incremented. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
