Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for a in L:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `a` and `L`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `L`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is 1
   - `L` is [1, 1]
   - `tot` is 2
   - `pow` is 2

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `a` is currently set to 1 and `L` is [1, 1], the loop will iterate over the next element in `L`.
   - After the first iteration, `a` was set to 1 (the first element of `L`), so now `a` should be set to the next element in `L`, which is 1.
   - The list `L` will be updated to remove the first element, so `L` will become [1].

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` will be set to the next element in `L`, which is 1.
   - `L` will be updated to [1].

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `a` is 1
   - `L` is [1]

Since `L` still contains elements, the loop can execute again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1]**
