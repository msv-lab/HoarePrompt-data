Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and neither `(a - b == -a)` nor `(b - a == -b)` holds true. If the difference between `a` and `b` is not equal to zero, the condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is satisfied. If the difference between `a` and `b` is zero, the condition `(a - b) % 2 == 0` is satisfied.**
