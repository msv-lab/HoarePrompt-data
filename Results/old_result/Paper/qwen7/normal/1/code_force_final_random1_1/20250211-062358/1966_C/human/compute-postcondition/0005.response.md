Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element, `dp` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, assigning the result to `n`. This means `n` now holds the index of the second last element in the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
