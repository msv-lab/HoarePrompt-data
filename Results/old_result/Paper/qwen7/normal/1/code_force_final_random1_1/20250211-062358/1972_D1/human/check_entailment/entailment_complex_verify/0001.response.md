### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Problem Statement Recap:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_15`:**
   - The function `func_15` attempts to solve the problem by iterating over possible values of \(i\) and computing \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\).
   - This approach does not directly address the condition \(a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Specifically, the function does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The loop in `func_15`:
     ```python
     i = 1
     ans = 0
     while i * i <= n + i:
         ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
         i += 1
     ```
     - This loop does not consider all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and does not check the condition \(a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - Instead, it seems to be counting some kind of integer division result, which is not relevant to the problem.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair.
   - A more appropriate approach would involve nested loops to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and use the `math.gcd` function to check the condition.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the required logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
