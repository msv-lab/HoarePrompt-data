Output State: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 2 * n` with a step of 2, so it will iterate over every second element in the list `l`. After all iterations, `score` will be the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element (index 0).

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `score` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `l` that have even indices (starting from index 0).
