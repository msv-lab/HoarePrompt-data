Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is set to 2.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` with more than one element.
- If the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` is greater than or equal to 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('Alice')` will execute without any conditional checks being performed because the problem does not specify any loops or if statements that would prevent this print statement from executing. Therefore, the print statement will simply output the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
