Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still set to 1. The initial state of `word` is not affected by this line of code, but it is mentioned that `word` is determined by the initial postcondition, which means its value is not altered by this code snippet.
