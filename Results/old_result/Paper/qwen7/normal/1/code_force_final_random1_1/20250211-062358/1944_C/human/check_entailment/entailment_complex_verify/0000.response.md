### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by picking an element from `a` and appending it to `c`, then deleting it from `a`.
- Bob picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score is the MEX of `c`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)`: Count the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - `start = 0`: Initialize `start` to 0.
   - `vis = set()`: Initialize a set to keep track of visited indices.
   - `while nums.get(start, 0)`: Loop until `start` reaches a point where `nums[start]` is 0.
     - `vis.add(start)`: Add `start` to the set of visited indices.
     - `nums[start] -= 1`: Decrement the count of `start` in `nums`.
     - `if nums.get(start + 1, 0)`: Check if `start + 1` is still in `nums`.
       - `nums[start + 1] -= 1`: Decrement the count of `start + 1` in `nums`.
       - `start += 1`: Increment `start`.
     - `else`: If `start + 1` is not in `nums`, print `start + 1` and return.

2. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The program tries to find the smallest missing number in the array `c` by iterating through the numbers and checking if they are present in the `vis` set.
   - However, the logic for updating `start` and handling the transition from one number to the next is flawed.
   - The program does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob correctly. Instead, it simply checks the presence of numbers in a linear fashion, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
3
0 0 1 1
```

- Correct Output: `2` (as explained in the example note).
- Incorrect Output: `1` (as per the provided program).

#### Detailed Explanation:
- In the first iteration, `start` is set to `0`.
- `nums[0]` is decremented and `0` is added to `vis`.
- `nums[1]` is checked, found to be present, so `1` is decremented and `start` is incremented to `1`.
- `nums[2]` is checked, found to be present, so `2` is decremented and `start` is incremented to `2`.
- `nums[3]` is checked, found to be present, so `3` is decremented and `start` is incremented to `3`.
- Since `nums[4]` is not present, the program prints `3 + 1 = 4`, which is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the MEX of the resulting array `c`. The logic for updating `start` and handling the transition from one number to the next is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not accurately model the turns taken by Alice and Bob and fails to determine the MEX of the resulting array `c` correctly.
