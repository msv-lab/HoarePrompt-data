Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. 

4. **Initial State of `n`**: The problem states that `n` is an integer between 2 and 24.

5. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `j` starts at 1 and the loop condition is `j <= n`). If `n` were 1, the loop would not execute because `1 <= 1` would only be true once, and then `j` would increment to 2, making the condition false.

6. **Other Variables**: The variable `x`, which is an input string from the user, is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be at least 2, and `j` is initialized to 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1**
