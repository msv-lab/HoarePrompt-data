Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list containing the single integer 0, `c` is a list containing the single integer 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `i` and `j` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
