Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid transition video plan for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' values to undecided transitions ('?') is flawed. 

Consider the following input:

```
5
.??F?
.??.?
F??.?
???.?
????.
```

The program's output for this input is:

```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```

However, this output does not satisfy the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type should appear for any permutation of the scenarios. For \(n = 5\), \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\). In the generated output, the sequence `FFFF` appears, which violates the condition because it has 4 consecutive 'F' videos, which is the maximum allowed but not allowed in any permutation.

To meet the requirement, the program needs to ensure that for any permutation of the scenarios, the sequence of transition videos does not exceed 4 consecutive 'F' or 'S'. The current logic does not guarantee this, as it assigns 'F' or 'S' based on a fixed set of rules without considering the overall sequence constraints for all permutations.
