Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is increased by 1, so `l = i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - `a` is defined as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` if `l - r > 0`, or remains as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of `a` and `b`:

- Since `l = 3`, we need to consider the conditions for updating `b`.
- If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated as specified. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

However, without specific values for `B`, `idx_B`, `A`, `idx_A`, and `r`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`. But we can express them in terms of the given variables.

Let's assume the following (since the exact values are not provided):

- `B[r - 1]` and `idx_B[r - 1]` are known values.
- `A[l - 1]`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, and `A[l - r - 1]`, `idx_A[l - r - 1]` are known values.
- `r` is a known value.

Based on this, we can express `a` and `b` as follows:

- `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`
- `b` will be either `A[2] + (2 - idx_A[2]) * r - A[2 - r - 1] - (idx_A[2] - idx_A[2 - r - 1]) * (3 - r)` if `3 - r > 0`, or `A[2] + (2 - idx_A[2]) * r`.

Now, substituting these into the print statement:

```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 2), end=' ')
```

Since we don't have the exact values, we can only describe the expression:

Output: **2 * (B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r) + 2 * (A[2] + (2 - idx_A[2]) * r - A[2 - r - 1] - (idx_A[2] - idx_A[2 - r - 1]) * (3 - r)) + (n - 2)**
