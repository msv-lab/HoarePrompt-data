Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- Depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
- If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1).

We need to determine the value of `i + 1` when the `print` statement executes.

Given:
- `i` is 1.
- `r` is decreased by 1, but the exact value of `r` is not specified. However, since `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `r` is decreased by 1, `r` must be a non-negative integer less than `l`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios for `r`:

1. If `r` is 0:
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - The `print` statement will print `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.

2. If `r` is greater than 0:
   - `a` is the value of `B[r]`.
   - `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
   - The `print` statement will still print `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.

In both cases, the value of `i + 1` is 2.

Output: **2**
