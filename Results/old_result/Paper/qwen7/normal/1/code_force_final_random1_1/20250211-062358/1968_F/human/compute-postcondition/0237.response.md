Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` now contains 'YES', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: 
- The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, and `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
