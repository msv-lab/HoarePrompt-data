Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `command` is a list of strings read from stdin.
   - `time` is incremented by 1.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - `time`: Since it is incremented by 1, let's denote it as `time = t + 1`, where `t` is the original value of `time` before incrementing.
   - `team`: This depends on the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0] == 'B'`, then `team = 1`; otherwise, `team = 0`.
   - `GoalName[team]`: This is a string that corresponds to the team. If `team = 1`, then `GoalName[team]` is "Golden Snitch" for Team B; if `team = 0`, then `GoalName[team]` is "Golden Snitch" for Team A.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `time %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`, where `%s` is replaced by the appropriate `GoalName[team]`.

Given these steps, the output will be:

Output: **(t + 1) Golden Snitch CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH** (where `t` is the original value of `time` and `team` determines whether it is "Golden Snitch" for Team A or Team B).
