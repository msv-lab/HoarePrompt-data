Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 4, `pow` is 4, `t` must be greater than 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The initial values of `a`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`, and `t` remain unchanged. Since the input values for `n` and `k` are not specified, they are left as "an input integer". The condition for `t` remains the same.
