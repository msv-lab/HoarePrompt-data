Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `impossible` is False
   - `m` must be greater than 3
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is `j + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. This means `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition does not depend on modifying `n` directly within the loop.

5. **Adjust the other states**: The states of `impossible`, `m`, `ans`, and `n` (which is `j + 1`) do not change based on the loop iteration itself.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`impossible` is False, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 2, `n` is `j + 1`**
