Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[5]` is 29, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), `i` is 5**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[5]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Given the initial values `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[3] = 5`, we substitute `i = 5` into the formula:

1. Calculate `dp[5]`:
   \[
   dp[5] = (dp[4] + 2 * (5 - 1) * dp[3]) \% 1000000007
   \]
   Since `dp[4]` is not given, we need to calculate it first:
   \[
   dp[4] = (dp[3] + 2 * (4 - 1) * dp[2]) \% 1000000007 = (5 + 2 * 3 * 3) \% 1000000007 = (5 + 18) \% 1000000007 = 23 \% 1000000007 = 23
   \]

2. Now, calculate `dp[5]`:
   \[
   dp[5] = (23 + 2 * 4 * 5) \% 1000000007 = (23 + 40) \% 1000000007 = 63 \% 1000000007 = 63
   \]

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[5]` is 29. All other variables remain unchanged.
