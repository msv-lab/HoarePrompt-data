Postcondition: `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1. If `i` is in both lists `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if it is less than `bOnes`, otherwise `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`. If `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, then `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
