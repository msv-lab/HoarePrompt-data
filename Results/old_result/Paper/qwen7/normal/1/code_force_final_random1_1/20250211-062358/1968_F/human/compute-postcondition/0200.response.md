Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
   - `idx` is increased by `1`.
   - `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 1`.
   - `idx` is increased by `1` at each iteration, so if `idx` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`, so `a[n + 1]` will be the value from `data[k + 1]`.
   - `pf[i]` is updated as `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, so `pf[n + 1]` will be `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` will contain the value `i`, so `mp[pf[n + 1]]` will contain the value `n + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `idx` will be `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `idx` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `a[n + 1]` will be the value from `data[idx]` (which is `data[k + 1]`).

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by `1`, `a[n + 1]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`**.

However, to provide a concrete state, we need to know the specific values of `n` and `idx` from the previous iteration. Assuming `n` and `idx` are known, the state can be formatted as follows:

State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is `k + 1`, `a[n + 1]` is now an integer value from `data[k + 1]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`**.

If we assume `n` and `idx` are unknown but follow the pattern, the general state can be written as:

State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by `1`, `a[n + 1]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`**.

For a specific example, if `n` was `5` and `idx` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, the state would be:

State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `6`, `idx` is `3`, `a[6]` is now an integer value from `data[3]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `6`**.
