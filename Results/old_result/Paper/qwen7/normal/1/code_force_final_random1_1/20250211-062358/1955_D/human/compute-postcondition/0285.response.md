Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n - m` must be at least 1, `a[i]` (or `a[i + m]` if the condition is true) is an element in the set `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is adjusted: if `a[i + m]` (or `a[i]`) is in `b_values` and was greater than 0, it is decremented by 1; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged, and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
