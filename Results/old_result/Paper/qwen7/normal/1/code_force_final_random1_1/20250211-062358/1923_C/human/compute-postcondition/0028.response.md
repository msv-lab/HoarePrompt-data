Output State: The loop has executed for all elements in the list `l`. The variable `i` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`. The variable `j` is the count of how many times the value 1 appeared in the list `l`. The list `p` contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `l` up to each step. The list `c` contains the count of 1s encountered so far for each iteration of the loop.

In more detail:
- `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `j` is the total count of 1s in `l`.
- `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of `l` up to that point.
- `c` is a list where each element is the count of 1s encountered up to that point in the loop.
