Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `input_value - 1` implies that `input_value` is an integer, and `input_value - 1` is assigned to `input_value - 1`, but this doesn't affect any other variables directly.
- `n` is an integer from the input split.
- `k` is an integer from the input split, and it is mentioned that `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).
- `s` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` is equal to `n`.
- `h` is equal to `n`.
- `p` is 1.
- `g` is 0.

The expression `2 * k - 1` depends only on the value of `k`. Since `k` is an integer from the input split and `k \leq (n + 1) // 2`, the value of `2 * k - 1` will be computed based on the value of `k`.

Given that `k` is an integer from the input, let's denote the value of `k` as `k_value`. Therefore, the expression `2 * k - 1` will evaluate to `2 * k_value - 1`.

Output: **2 * k_value - 1 (where k_value is the value of k, an integer from the input split and k_value \(\leq (n + 1) // 2\))**
