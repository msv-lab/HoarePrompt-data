Output State: **`res` is '<', `k` is `i`**

Explanation: The code `k = i` assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, `k` will simply take the value of `i`. The value of `res` remains unchanged as it was initially set to the input provided by the user, which is '<'.
