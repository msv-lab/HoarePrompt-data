Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard. The issue lies in the `invalid` set and how it is used to determine the number of valid positions for placing rooks.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Set Usage**: The `invalid` set stores the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, the calculation of the number of valid positions for placing rooks is incorrect. Specifically, the line `print(max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]))` assumes that the number of valid positions is simply `n - len(invalid)`, which is not accurate.

2. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to place rooks in a smaller board. However, the formula used in `func_1` does not account for the specific constraints of the problem (i.e., the positions that are already invalid).

3. **Incorrect Configuration Counting**: The program does not correctly handle the mirrored placements and the constraints of the problem. For example, if a rook is placed at `(r, c)` and the computer mirrors it to `(c, r)`, the program does not adjust the `invalid` set correctly to reflect this mirrored placement.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:
- \( n = 4 \)
- \( k = 1 \)
- Moves: \( (1, 2) \)

After the first move, the board looks like this:
- White rook at (1, 2)
- Black rook at (2, 1)

The valid positions for the next move are (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 4). However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of valid positions as `n - len(invalid)`, which would be `4 - 2 = 2`. This is incorrect because there are actually 4 valid positions.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. Maintain a set of invalid rows and columns.
2. Calculate the number of valid positions for placing rooks using combinatorial methods.
3. Adjust the dynamic programming approach to account for the mirrored placements and the constraints of the problem.

Since the provided solution does not correctly implement these steps, the program is incorrect.
