Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split, and if `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` is greater than `n`. If `m` is not greater than `n`, then `m` is less than or equal to `n`. Furthermore, if `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `m` is less than or equal to `n` but not equal to `n - 1`, and either both `m` and `n` are even, or both `m` and `n` are odd.
