Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions to Check:**
   - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes". This condition checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, which is possible if all moves are additions.
   - If `m > n`, it prints "No". This condition checks if the number of cubes requested is greater than the number of moves, which is impossible since we cannot add more cubes than we have made moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes". This condition checks if the number of cubes is one less than the number of moves, which is possible if all but one move were additions.
   - The next conditions check if both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd:
     - If both `n` and `m` are even, it prints "Yes". This condition is redundant because if `n` and `m` are both even, they can be equal or differ by an even number, which is already covered by the previous logic.
     - If both `n` and `m` are odd, it prints "Yes". This condition is also redundant for the same reason as above.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

### Issues Identified:
1. **Redundant Conditions:**
   - The conditions `elif m == n - 1:` and the subsequent checks for both `n` and `m` being even or odd are redundant and do not cover all necessary cases. Specifically, the logic does not handle the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa.

2. **Logical Gaps:**
   - The program does not handle the general case where the difference between `n` and `m` is an even number. For example, if `n` is 6 and `m` is 2, the difference is 4, which is even, and it should be possible to achieve this by adding and removing cubes appropriately.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, so the parity (evenness or oddness) of the difference must be zero.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical gaps and redundant conditions. A corrected version should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
