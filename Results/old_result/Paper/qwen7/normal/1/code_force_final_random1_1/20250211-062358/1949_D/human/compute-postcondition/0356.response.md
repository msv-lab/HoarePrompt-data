Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
   - `j` is either 1 or 2 (since it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - The character at position `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'.

4. **Analyze the Postcondition**:
   - If either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as the loop condition does not depend on modifying `n` within the loop itself.
   - The postcondition for `nx` will be evaluated again based on the new value of `j`.

Given that `j` is currently 1 and will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration, we need to check if `j` being 2 affects the postcondition for `nx`.

Since `j` is currently 1 and will be 2 in the next iteration, we need to consider the postcondition for `j = 2`:
- If `i` or `j` (now 2) is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'.
- Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `j` being 2 and the postcondition for `nx` based on this new value of `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 1) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'**.
