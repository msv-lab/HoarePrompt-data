Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the previous value of `dp` for every `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, inclusive, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order followed by 0.**

Explanation: The code first takes a space-separated list of integers as input, converts it into a set to remove duplicates, sorts it in descending order, and appends a 0 at the end. This modifies the `arr` variable to a new sorted list in descending order followed by 0. The other variables (`tc`, `i`, `n`, and `dp`) remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.
