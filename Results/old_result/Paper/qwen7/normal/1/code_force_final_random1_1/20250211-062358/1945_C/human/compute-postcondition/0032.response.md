Output State: **`zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 0 or 2; `zero_perc` is either 50 or 100; `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to be `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 1 more than its previous value, let's denote the previous value of `i` as `prev_i`. Therefore, `i = prev_i + 1`. Given that `zero` is either 1 or 0, `zero * 100` will be either 100 or 0. Dividing by `(i + 1)` (which is `prev_i + 2`) will result in either 50 or 0, depending on the value of `zero`. Hence, `zero_perc` is either 50 or 100. All other variables remain unchanged.
