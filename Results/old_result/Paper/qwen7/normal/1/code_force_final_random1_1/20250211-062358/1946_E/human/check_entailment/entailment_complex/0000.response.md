Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the input to extract the necessary parameters for each test case.
2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The code checks for edge cases where the last index of prefix maximums and the first index of suffix maximums do not match, which would indicate an impossible permutation, and correctly outputs 0 in such cases.
3. **Combinatorial Calculations**: The code uses combinatorial calculations to determine the number of possible permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. This involves calculating binomial coefficients using `func_2` and `func_1`.
4. **Modulo Operation**: All operations are performed under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.
5. **Recursive Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is implemented correctly and handles the Euclidean algorithm for computing modular inverses, which is essential for calculating binomial coefficients under modulo.
6. **Recursive Function `func_2`**: The function `func_2` correctly uses `func_1` to compute the binomial coefficient and applies the modulo operation.
7. **Permutation Count Calculation**: The logic for calculating the number of permutations based on the indices of prefix and suffix maximums appears to be sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the above points, the code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. Therefore, the provided code should produce the correct output for the given examples and any other valid inputs within the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
