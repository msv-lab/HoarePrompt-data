Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum value between the current `ans` and `i`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` still holds. The value of `ans` is updated based on the new value of `i`.
