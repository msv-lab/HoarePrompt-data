Output State: **`custo` is the value of `custo` plus `a_values[0]`, `y` is one less than the final value of `custo` plus the value of `b_values[y]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of `custo` or `y`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
