Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition states that `sm` is updated based on the comparison between `suf[i] - smin[i]` and `sm`. Specifically:
   - If `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is equal to -111, then `sm` is set to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and goes up to `i = n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `sm` could have changed based on the postcondition, but it is not specified what the exact value of `sm` is after the previous iteration. However, since we need to consider the general case, we will keep `sm` as it is unless there is specific information about its value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `sm` remains unchanged unless there is specific information indicating otherwise.

Since no specific value of `sm` is given, we will assume it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`sm` is updated based on the previous iteration's conditions, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before**. 

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4. 

So, the final state is:

State: **`sm` is updated based on the previous iteration's conditions, `i` is 4, `n` is the same as before**.
