Output State: **`zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 0 or 2; `zero_perc` is either 50 or 100; `one_perc` is calculated as ((o - one) * 100) // (n - i - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `one_perc` is calculated using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, where `o` represents `one`, `n` represents `zero`, and `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value. Since `one` can be either 0 or 2, and `zero` can be either 1 or 0, the value of `one_perc` will depend on these values.
- The values of `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `s`, `i`, and `lst` remain unchanged from their initial states, except for `one_perc` which is now updated based on the given formula.
