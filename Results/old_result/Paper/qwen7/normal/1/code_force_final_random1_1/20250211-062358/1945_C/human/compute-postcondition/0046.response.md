Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.**

This means that `mini` now holds the smaller value between its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The exact numerical value of `mini` depends on the current value of `mini` and the values of `pk` and `ele`.
