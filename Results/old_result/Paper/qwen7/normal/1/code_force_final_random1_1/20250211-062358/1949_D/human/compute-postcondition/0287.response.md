Output State: **`j` is within the range 1 to n, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` is `'F'` concatenated with the previous value of `nx`, and neither `i` is in `sb[:n // 4]` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4]`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is assigned the value `'F'` concatenated with its previous value. Since `nx` was not previously defined, it is initialized to `'F'`. The values of `j`, `n`, and the conditions about `i` and `j` in relation to `sb` remain unchanged.
