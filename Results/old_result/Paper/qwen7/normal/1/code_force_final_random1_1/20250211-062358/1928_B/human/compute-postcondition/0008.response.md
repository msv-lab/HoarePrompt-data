Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(arr) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element.
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[i]`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the value `tem + [tem]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `len(arr) - 2`.
   - The value of `tem` remains the same because it is calculated based on the entire list `arr` and does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `ans` remains the same as well since it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `len(arr) - 2`.
   - `arr` remains the same.
   - `tem` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[i]`, `ans` is a list containing the value `tem + [tem]`**.
