Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: Since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't hold any specific value within the loop, the key is to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is valid. The loop will execute as long as the input is a positive integer.

3. **Consider the constraints**: The problem states that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer, and for each test case, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, q \leq 3 \times 10^5\). This means that the input to `int(input())` should be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that the loop will execute as long as the input is a positive integer, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input provided to `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, and the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer**
