Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `m` is updated to an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, and `mn` remain unchanged, but their values are no longer specified. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are now updated to the input integers.
