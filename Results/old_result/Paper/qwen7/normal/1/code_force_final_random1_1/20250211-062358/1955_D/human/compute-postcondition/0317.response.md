Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `n - m` must be at least 1; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` remains 2 or 3, `n - m` must still be at least 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
