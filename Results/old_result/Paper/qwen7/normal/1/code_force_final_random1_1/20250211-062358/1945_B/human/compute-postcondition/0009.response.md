Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, then no changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `(m % a != 0 or m % b != 0 or (a == 1) or (b == 1))` holds true.**
