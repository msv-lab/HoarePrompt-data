Postcondition: `pk` is an integer, `elem` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, and `final` contains the element `elem`. This is because if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is set to `elem`. There is no else part, so no additional conditions are applied.
