Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- The current value of `B` multiplied by 2 is less than `C`.

The print statement is `print(A * B)`.

Given the conditions, we know the following:
- `A` and `B` are integers obtained from the input.
- The product `A * B` will be printed.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `A * B`. However, we can describe the expression that will be evaluated and printed.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers obtained from the input)**
