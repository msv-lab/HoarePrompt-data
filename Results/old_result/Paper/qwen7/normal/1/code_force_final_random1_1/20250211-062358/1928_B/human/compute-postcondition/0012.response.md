Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `i` is `-1`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing all intermediate products of `tem` as each element of `arr` is processed from the end to the beginning.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be set to `-1` because the loop runs in reverse from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. The variable `tem` will hold the product of all elements in the list `arr`, as it multiplies each element of `arr` in sequence during the loop. The list `ans` will contain all the intermediate values of `tem` after each iteration, starting from the product of all elements down to the product of all but the last element of `arr`.
