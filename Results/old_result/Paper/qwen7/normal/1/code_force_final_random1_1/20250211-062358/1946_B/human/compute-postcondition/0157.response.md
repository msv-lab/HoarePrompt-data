Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is the length of the list `l`
   - `smin[i]` is the suffix minimum at index `i` and `i + 1`
   - If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is updated such that the suffix minimum at index `i` becomes `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` remains unchanged with the last element being `smin[i]`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the new value of `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is the length of the list `l`.
   - For the new value of `i` (which is `n - 1`), `smin[i]` will be the suffix minimum at index `i` and `i + 1` (if `i + 1` is within bounds).

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains the length of the list `l`.
   - `smin[i]` will be the suffix minimum at index `i` and `i + 1` (if `i + 1` is within bounds).

Given this, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, and `smin[i]` is the suffix minimum at index `i` and `i + 1`**.

If `i + 1` is out of bounds, then `smin[i]` would be the last element of `smin`. However, since we are starting a new iteration, we assume `i + 1` is within bounds for the next iteration.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, and `smin[i]` is the suffix minimum at index `i` and `i + 1`**.
