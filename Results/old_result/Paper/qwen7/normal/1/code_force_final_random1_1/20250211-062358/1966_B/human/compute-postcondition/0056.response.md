Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `tc` in the range `range(t)`.
2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: The postcondition given at the end of the previous iteration is:
   - `tc` is 1
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is `j + 1`
   - `m` is greater than 3
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `impossible` is True

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `tc` is within the range of `t`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `tc` starts from 1 and the loop will increment `tc` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `tc` will be `2`.
   - The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `impossible` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body (as per the provided information).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is `j + 1`, `m` is greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True**
