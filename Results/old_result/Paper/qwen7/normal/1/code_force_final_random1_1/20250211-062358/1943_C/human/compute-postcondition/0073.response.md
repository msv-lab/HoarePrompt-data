Postcondition: **`i` is either 1 or 6, `ci` is either 1 or unchanged, and `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `len(path_ba)` is odd, then `i` is 1, `ci` is 1, and `ops` is a list containing three tuples \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\]. Otherwise, `i` is 6, `ci` is unchanged, and `ops` contains the tuples \[(c1, 3), (c2, 1), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7)\], where `c1` and `c2` are the values they had before the loop.**
