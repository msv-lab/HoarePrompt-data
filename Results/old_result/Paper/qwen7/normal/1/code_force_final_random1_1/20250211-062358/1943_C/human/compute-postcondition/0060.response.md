Output State: **`c2` is 2, `n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, -1]`. The length of `path_ba` is even.**

Explanation: The code `c2 = len(path_ba) // 2` calculates the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. Given that `path_ba` contains 4 elements (as it is a list of length 4 and the length is even), `len(path_ba)` is 4. Therefore, `c2` is calculated as `4 // 2`, which equals 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
