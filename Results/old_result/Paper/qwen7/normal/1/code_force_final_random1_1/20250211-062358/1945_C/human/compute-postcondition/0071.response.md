Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and `final` is sorted, `final` now includes 0, the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was previously sorted and contained elements from `lst` that had the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, adding `0` to `final` means that `final` now includes `0`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
