Based on the initial state provided:

- `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the previous value of `dp` for every `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.
- `i` is now `n`.
- `n` is the final length of `arr` minus 1.
- `tc` must be at least 1.
- `arr` is updated from user input.

The `print` statement checks the value of `dp` and prints either "Alice" or "Bob" accordingly.

To determine the exact output, we need to consider the value of `dp`:

- If `dp` is `True`, the print statement will output "Alice".
- If `dp` is `False`, the print statement will output "Bob".

Since the exact value of `dp` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine whether it is `True` or `False`. However, we know that `dp` is derived from the conditions described and the final value of `dp` is what matters for the print statement.

Therefore, the output will depend on the final value of `dp`.

Output: **Alice** if `dp` is `True`, otherwise **Bob**.
