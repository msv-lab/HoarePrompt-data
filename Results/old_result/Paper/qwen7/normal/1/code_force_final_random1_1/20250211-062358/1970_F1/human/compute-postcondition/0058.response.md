Postcondition: `ind` is incremented by 1, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) does not contain tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`, and `ind` is less than `len(line)`, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', and the current character of `line[ind]` is 'G'.
