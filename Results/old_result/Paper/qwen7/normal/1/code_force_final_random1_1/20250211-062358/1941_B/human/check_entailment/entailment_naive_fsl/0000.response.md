Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the program only checks if any element becomes negative during the operations and stops immediately if it finds a negative value. However, the problem requires checking if it's possible to make all elements zero, not just stopping at the first negative value.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The program will output "NO" because it finds `a[0]` becomes negative after the first operation. However, as shown in the problem's note, it is possible to make all elements zero through a series of valid operations.

The correct approach would involve ensuring that the sum of the array remains invariant and that the operations can reduce all elements to zero without encountering negative values prematurely.
