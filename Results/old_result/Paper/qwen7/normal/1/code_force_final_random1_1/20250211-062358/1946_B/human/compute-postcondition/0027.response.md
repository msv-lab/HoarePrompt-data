Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1, `smin` is updated by appending `smin[i]` to the list.**

Explanation: The code `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Since `i` was previously incremented by 1, the value appended is `smin[i-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
