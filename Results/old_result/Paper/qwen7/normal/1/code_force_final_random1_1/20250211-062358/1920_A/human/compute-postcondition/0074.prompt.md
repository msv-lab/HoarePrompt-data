Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `t` will be the last integer from the input, `v` will be the last integer from the input, `num` will be a list containing all integers `v` from each iteration where `t` was 3, `start` will be the minimum value of all `v` where `t` was 1, and `end` will be the maximum value of all `v` where `t` was 2. `count_num` will be 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list). If the condition `i < start or i > end` is true, then the program does nothing. Otherwise, `count_num` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list). In both cases (whether `i < start or i > end` or not), `num` remains an empty list and `i` remains as the first element of `num`, which is an empty list, and there is no change in the value of `count_num`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list). In both cases (whether `i < start or i > end` or not), `num` remains an empty list and `i` remains as the first element of `num`, which is an empty list, and there is no change in the value of `count_num`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
