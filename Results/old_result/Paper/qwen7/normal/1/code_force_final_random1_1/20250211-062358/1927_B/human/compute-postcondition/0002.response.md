Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list named `array` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input, splitting the input string into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `l` remains as an input integer.
