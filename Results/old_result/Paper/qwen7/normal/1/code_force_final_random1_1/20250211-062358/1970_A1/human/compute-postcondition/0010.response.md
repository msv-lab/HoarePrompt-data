Postcondition: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element which is a `BalanceInfo` object. If `s[i]` is '(', `balance_info[0].balance` is 2 and `balance_info[0].i` is 1, otherwise `balance_info[0].balance` is -1 and `balance_info[0].i` is 0.
