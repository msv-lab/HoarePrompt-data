Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 4, `pow` is 4.

Explanation: The loop continues until `L` is exhausted. Given the initial conditions and the provided output states, we can deduce the following:

- After the first iteration, `a` is set to 2, `L` becomes [1, 1], and `pow` is 2.
- After the second iteration, `a` is set to 1, `L` becomes [1], and `tot` is updated to 2, with `pow` remaining 2.
- After the third iteration, `a` is set to 1, `L` becomes [], `tot` is updated to 3 (from the previous total of 2 plus the current `a` value of 1), and `pow` remains 2.

Since `L` is now empty, the loop terminates. Before the last iteration, `tot` was 3, and `a` was 1. During the last iteration, `tot` is incremented by `a`, making `tot` equal to 4. Also, `pow` is multiplied by 2 each time the loop runs, so it becomes 4 after three iterations. Thus, the final state is `a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 4, and `pow` is 4.
