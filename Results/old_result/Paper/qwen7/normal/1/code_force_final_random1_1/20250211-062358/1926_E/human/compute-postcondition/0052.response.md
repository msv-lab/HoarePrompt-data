Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [2, 1], `k` is less than or equal to 4, `pow` is 8, `tot` is 2, `n` is 0, `m` is 1**

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` (which is 1) to the list `L`. Initially, `L` is `[2]`. After appending `1` to `L`, `L` becomes `[2, 1]`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `k`, `pow`, `tot`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
