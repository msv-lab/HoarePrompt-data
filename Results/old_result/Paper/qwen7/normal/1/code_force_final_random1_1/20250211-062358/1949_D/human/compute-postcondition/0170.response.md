Postcondition: `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', depending on whether `i` is in `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4]`. If `i` is in `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4]`, then `nx` is set to 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is set to 'S'. Additionally, `n` must be between 2 and 24, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'.
