Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is `(n - m) + 1`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of the value `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Here, `i` is defined as `(n - m) + 1`. Since `b_values` must contain at least one element, `b[i]` refers to one of the elements in `b_values`. The value of `i` remains unchanged from its initial definition, and `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.
