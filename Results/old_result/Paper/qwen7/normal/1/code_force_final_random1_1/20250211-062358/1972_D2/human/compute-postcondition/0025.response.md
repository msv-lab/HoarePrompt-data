Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Current values of the variables**:
   - `x` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 5
   - `m` must be at least 20
   - `y` is 1
   - `cnt` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop condition)

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with current values**:
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`: 
     \[
     (2 + 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6
     \]
   - Check if `6 <= n`: Since `n` must be at least 5, this condition is satisfied as long as `n >= 5`.
   - Calculate `(x + y) * y`: 
     \[
     (2 + 1) * 1 = 3 * 1 = 3
     \]
   - Check if `3 <= m`: Since `m` must be at least 20, this condition is not satisfied.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions in the loop must be true.
   - The first condition `(x + y) * x <= n` is already satisfied as long as `n >= 5`.
   - The second condition `(x + y) * y <= m` needs to be satisfied. With `x = 2` and `y = 1`, the expression simplifies to `3 * 1 = 3`. Therefore, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute the first time.

Since `m` must be at least 20, it already satisfies the condition `m >= 3`, but we need to ensure it is at least 20 to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `x`, `y`, `n`, or `cnt`. The only thing that needs to be ensured is that `m` is at least 20.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 20, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 2**
