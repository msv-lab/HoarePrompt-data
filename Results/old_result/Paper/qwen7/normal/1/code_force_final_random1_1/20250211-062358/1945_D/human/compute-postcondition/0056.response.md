Output State: **`v` is `v - 1`; `total` is the original `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The variable `v` is updated to `v - 1`. The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The variables `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `best` remain unchanged from their initial state.
