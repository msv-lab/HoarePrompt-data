Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `ele` which is iterating over the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `lst`**: The list `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop iterations.

3. **Understand the conditions for inclusion in `lst`**: For an index `i + 1` to be included in `lst`, both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` must meet the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`.

4. **Initial values and conditions**: Given that `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` are calculated based on the entire string `s` and the value of `n`, these values are already determined before the loop starts. The list `lst` is constructed based on these values during the loop iterations.

5. **State adjustment**: Since the loop is iterating over `lst`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `lst` itself. We need to ensure that `lst` is non-empty and contains valid elements that satisfy the conditions mentioned.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the list `lst`.

**State:**
**`lst` is a non-empty list containing indices `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop iterations.**
