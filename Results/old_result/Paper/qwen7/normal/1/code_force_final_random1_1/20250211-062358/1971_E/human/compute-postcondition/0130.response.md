Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `q` is `len(a) - q`
- `l` is `1`
- `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (q - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`
- `i` is `1`
- `ql` is `q - a[s - 1]`

### Loop Head:
```
for l in range(q):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `l`**: The loop variable `l` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration. Since it is set to `1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will increment to `2` in the next iteration.
2. **Variable `q`**: The value of `q` does not change within the loop; it remains as `len(a) - q`.
3. **Variables `m`, `i`, and `ql`**: These variables are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop itself. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

### Updated State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `l` will be `2` in the next iteration.
- `q` remains `len(a) - q`.
- `m` remains `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (q - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`.
- `i` remains `1`.
- `ql` remains `q - a[s - 1]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`q` is `len(a) - q`, `l` is `2`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (q - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`, `i` is `1`, `ql` is `q - a[s - 1]`**
