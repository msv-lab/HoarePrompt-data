Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive); `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(b[1])` assigns the second element of the list `b` (which is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string) to the variable `k` after converting it to an integer. The values of `t` and the list `b` remain unchanged.
