Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where Kirill needs to move through multiple positions to reach his desired spot, and it incorrectly accumulates costs without properly considering the optimal path.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

The expected output should be 14 because:
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- He can move to position 3 for 4 coins.
- From position 3, he can move to position 2 for 3 coins.
- From position 2, he can move to position 1 for 7 coins.
- Total cost: 4 + 3 + 7 = 14.

However, the program calculates the cost as 17:
- It moves from position 4 to 3 for 4 coins.
- Then from position 3 to 2 for 3 coins.
- Then from position 2 to 1 for 7 coins.
- But it also adds the cost of moving from position 3 to 1 for 8 coins, which is unnecessary.

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the minimization of costs for multiple intermediate steps, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
