Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `5`, `a[5]` is `a[5] - 2 * opNum`, `opNum` is `a[5]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[6] - 2 * opNum`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 5, `stop` is `True`, `n` must be greater than 6, `a[5]` is `a[5] - opNum`, and `opNum` is `a[5]`.
- The code updates `a[i + 1]` by subtracting `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 5, `i + 1` is 6, so `a[6]` is updated to `a[6] - 2 * opNum`.
- The values of `stop`, `i`, `n`, `a[5]`, and `opNum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged values along with the updated value of `a[6]`.
