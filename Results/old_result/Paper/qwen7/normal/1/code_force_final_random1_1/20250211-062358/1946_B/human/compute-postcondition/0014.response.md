Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is `n`.

In this final output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). The variable `b` and `k` also remain unchanged as they are derived from the input string and do not change within the loop. The list `l` is the result of mapping `int` to the input split and remains unchanged. The list `suf` is updated after each iteration of the loop, where each element `suf[j]` is the sum of all elements in `l` up to index `j`. The variable `n` is the length of the list `l` and does not change during the loop. After all iterations, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `n`.
