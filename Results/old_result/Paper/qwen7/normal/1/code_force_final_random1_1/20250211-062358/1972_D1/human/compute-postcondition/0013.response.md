Output State: `i` will be `n + 1`, `n` must be a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `ans` will be the sum of 2 plus the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)` for each iteration from `i = 2` to `i = n + 1`.

To explain further, the loop continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`. The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`. This process repeats until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. Therefore, `i` will eventually become `n + 1`, and `ans` will accumulate the sum of the integer divisions as described.
