Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user**.

Explanation: The code `a = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
