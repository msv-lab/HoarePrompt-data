Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` - `delta` - `delta`), `distance` remains unchanged, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`**.

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Given that `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, the new value of `rest` becomes `k - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta) - delta`. The value of `distance` remains unchanged, and `pos` must still be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.
