Output State: **`c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. These integers are then collected into a list named `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The values of `c` and `na_frente` remain unchanged, and `pos_final` is also unchanged.
