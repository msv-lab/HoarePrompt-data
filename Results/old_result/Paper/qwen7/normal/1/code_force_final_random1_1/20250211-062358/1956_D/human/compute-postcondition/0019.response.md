Output State: **`s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`, and the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` is called.**

Explanation: The function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` is called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. This call does not immediately return a value or change the values of `s`, `mx`, or `pos` directly. Instead, it initiates a recursive process. The precondition that `pos` is not equal to `l` remains unchanged. The values of `s`, `mx`, and `pos` remain as they were before the function call.
