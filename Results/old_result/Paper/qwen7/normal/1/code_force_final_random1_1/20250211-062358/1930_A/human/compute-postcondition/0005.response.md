Output State: **`score` is `l[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code updates the `score` by adding the value of `l[i]` to it. Since `score` was initially 0, after executing `score += l[i]`, `score` now holds the value of `l[i]`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
