Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `v` which iterates from `na_frente` to `-1` in steps of `-1`.

2. **Understand the loop body behavior**: The loop body modifies the state based on the conditions provided:
   - If `v <= pos_final`, it checks if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Depending on the result, `total` is updated.
   - If `v > pos_final`, `total` is still updated by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `v` starts the loop at `na_frente` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches `-1`.
   - Since `v` is decreased by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `v` will be `v - 1`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `v >= -1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `v` will be `v - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `best`, and `total` remain unchanged.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`v` is `v - 1`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `best`, and `total` are unchanged.**
