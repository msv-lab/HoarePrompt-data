Let's break down the initial state and the expression for `m` step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which means `s` is the smallest index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
   - `q` is equal to `len(a)`, so `q` is the length of the list `a`.

2. **Expression for `m`:**
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`.
   - Here, `ad[s]` is the `s`-th element of the list `ad`.

Given these steps, let's determine the value of `m`:

- Since `s` is determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, it means `a[s-1] <= ql < a[s]` if `ql` is not equal to `a[s]`.
- `ql` is the difference between the input integer and `a[s-1]`.
- Therefore, `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `b`, `bd`, and `ad`, we'll keep them in their symbolic form. However, the key point is that `m` is computed based on the formula provided.

Finally, the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`.

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s]))**
