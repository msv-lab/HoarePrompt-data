Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `a[i + 1]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative; `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative.
