You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `ans` will be the maximum value it attains during the entire execution of the loop for all test cases. This value is determined by checking all possible `i` values from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` for each test case, and updating `ans` whenever a larger valid `i` is found that meets the specified conditions.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` will hold the highest value that satisfies the given conditions for any `i` within the specified range for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(n\). It then finds the maximum integer \(i\) such that \(x - n \cdot i \geq 0\) and both \(x - n \cdot i\) and \(x\) are divisible by \(i\), for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(\sqrt{x}\). After processing all test cases, it prints the maximum value of \(i\) found for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly calculate the maximum balance for the given constraints. Here's why:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The program iterates through possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, and similarly for `x // i`.

2. **Max Balance Calculation**: The program updates `ans` with the maximum value found that satisfies the conditions for both `i` and `x // i`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `n` is large enough to make `x // n` very small, ensuring that the balance is calculated correctly.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. There are no apparent flaws or missing edge cases that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description.
