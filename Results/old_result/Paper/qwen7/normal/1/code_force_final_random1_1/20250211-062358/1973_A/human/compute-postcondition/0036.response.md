Output State: **`p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `-1` to the list `resultats`. This operation does not affect the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, or `total_points`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values and relationships. The list `resultats` now contains the value `-1`.
