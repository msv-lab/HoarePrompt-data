Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The relevant variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value.
   - `zero` is either 1 or 0.
   - `one` is either 0 or 2.
   - `zero_perc` is either 50 or 100.
   - `one_perc` is calculated as `((zero - one) * 100) // (n - i - 1)`.
   - `s` is a string.
   - `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`.
   - The condition for updating the variables is that `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.

3. **Analyze the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1` (where `i` was the previous value).

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 2` (since it was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - The condition for continuing the loop is that `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` will retain their original values unless the condition is not met.
   - `s` and `lst` will remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop condition.

Given the above analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 0 or 2; `zero_perc` is either 50 or 100; `one_perc` is calculated as ((zero - one) * 100) // (n - (i + 2) - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`.**
