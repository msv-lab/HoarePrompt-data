Output State: **`tc` is equal to `tc` - 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element, `dp` is the result of applying the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` iteratively from `i = 1` to `i = n-1**.

Explanation: The line `tc -= 1` decreases the value of `tc` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `arr`, and `dp`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
