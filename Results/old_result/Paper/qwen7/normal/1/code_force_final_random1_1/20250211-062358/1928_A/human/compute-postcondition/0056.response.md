Output State: **`t` is 9999, `_` is 2, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2**.

The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of these variables.
