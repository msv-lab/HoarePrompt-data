Output State: **`ad` now contains the element `a[k + 1] - a[k]`, `i` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, the value being appended is `a[k + 1] - a[k]`. The value of `i` is updated to `k + 1` after the operation, but the initial value of `i` as `k + 1` is preserved for clarity. The state of `ad` includes the newly added element, and `i` reflects its updated value.
