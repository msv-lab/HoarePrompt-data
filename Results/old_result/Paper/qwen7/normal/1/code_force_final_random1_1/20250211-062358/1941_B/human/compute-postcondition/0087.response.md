Output State: `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is greater than 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3`. Given that the loop breaks when `a[i] < 0` and considering the operation performed in each iteration (`a[i] -= opNum; a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum; a[i + 2] -= opNum`), the loop will continue until `a[i]` becomes negative. Since the operations are consistent and the loop breaks as soon as `a[i]` becomes negative, the final state of `a[i]` will be `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]` because it gets halved in each iteration until it becomes negative. The values of `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]` will be adjusted accordingly based on the number of iterations, resulting in the given expressions.
