The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, and `n` is `log2(n_cases)`. Since `n_cases` must be greater than 4, `n` must be at least 3 (because \( \log_2(8) = 3 \)). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`, and since `n` is at least 3, `power` must be less than 3. However, since `power` is currently 3, it cannot be less than 3. Thus, we need to increase `power` to be less than `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `power` to be less than `n`. The smallest possible value for `n` is 3, so `power` should be set to 2 or less.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 2**
