Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, and `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.**

In more detail:
- The list `A` will contain the cumulative sum of distances from the last appended index in `idx_A` to the current index `i`, multiplied by the length of `idx_A` each time a '>' is encountered.
- The list `idx_A` will contain all the indices where the character in `s` is '>'.
- The final state of `A` will be a list of integers representing these calculated distances, and `idx_A` will be a list of indices where '>' characters appear in the string `s`.
