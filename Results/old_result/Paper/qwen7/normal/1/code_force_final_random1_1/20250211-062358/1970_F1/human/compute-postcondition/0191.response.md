Output State: **`command` is a list of strings read from stdin, `time` is incremented by 1, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10.**

Explanation: The code `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. The value of `team` is determined by whether the first character of `obj` is 'B' or not. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
