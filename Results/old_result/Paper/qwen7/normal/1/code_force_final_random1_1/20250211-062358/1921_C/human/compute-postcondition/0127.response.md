Output State: **`i` is 2, `array2` contains an element equal to (arr[2] - arr[1]) * a**.

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `arr[i]` is `arr[2]` and `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[1]`. Therefore, `array2` now contains an element equal to `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. The conditions for the initial state of `array2` remain unchanged because the code does not depend on those conditions.
