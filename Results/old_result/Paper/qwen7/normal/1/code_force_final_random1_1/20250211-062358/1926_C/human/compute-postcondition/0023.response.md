Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is "400002"
   - `j` is "0"
   - `pd['400002']` is 8

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `1` to `N`.
   - This means `i` should be incremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body adds each digit of `i` to `pd[i]`.
   - After the first iteration, `j` becomes "0" and `pd['400002']` is updated to `4 + 0 = 4`.
   - After the second iteration, `j` again becomes "0" and `pd['400002']` is updated to `4 + 0 = 4` (no change because it was already 4).
   - After the third iteration, `j` becomes "4" and `pd['400002']` is updated to `4 + 4 = 8`.

4. **Current State**:
   - `i` is "400002"
   - `j` is "0"
   - `pd['400002']` is 8

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become "400003".

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - `j` and `pd['400002']` are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is "400003", `j` is "0", `pd['400002']` is 8**
