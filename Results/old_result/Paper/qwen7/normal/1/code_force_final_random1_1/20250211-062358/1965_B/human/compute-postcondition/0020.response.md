Output State: **`ans` is an empty list, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of `bk`, and `k` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The line `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) and assigns it to `lk`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
