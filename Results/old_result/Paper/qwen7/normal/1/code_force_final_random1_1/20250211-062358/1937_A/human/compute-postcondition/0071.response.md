Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`. For each `n`, if `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
