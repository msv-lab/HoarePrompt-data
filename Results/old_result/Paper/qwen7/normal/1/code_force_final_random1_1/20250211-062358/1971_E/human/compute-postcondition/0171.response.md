Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` is set to 1.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
4. **Analyze the given information**:
   - `i` is set to `ad[i] / bd[i]` and appended to `v` at the end of each iteration.
   - `len(b)` must be in the range `[1, len(a))`.
   - `i` will be set to 1 after the loop starts.

Given that `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop, and considering the loop condition `i < len(a)`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, the first iteration will check if `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and still satisfy the condition `i < len(a)`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2), and it must still be less than `len(a)`.

The state of `len(b)` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop itself.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` will be 2 (since it was 1 and incremented by 1).
- `len(b)` must still be in the range `[1, len(a))`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `len(b)` must be in the range `[1, len(a))`**
