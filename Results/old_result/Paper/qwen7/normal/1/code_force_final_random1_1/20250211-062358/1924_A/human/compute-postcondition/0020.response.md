Output State: **`cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the first character of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` (which is the second character of the string `s`) and the ASCII value of `'a'`, and assigns this difference to the variable `cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
