Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum score for each test case. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the program sorts the list of 2n integers. Sorting ensures that when we pair the smallest elements together, we maximize the sum of the minimums of each pair.
3. **Scoring Logic**: After sorting, the program iterates over the sorted list, summing every second element starting from the first element. This effectively pairs the smallest elements together and adds their minimum values to the score.
4. **Output**: The score is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, this approach is optimal because it always pairs the smallest available elements, ensuring the maximum possible score is achieved.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
