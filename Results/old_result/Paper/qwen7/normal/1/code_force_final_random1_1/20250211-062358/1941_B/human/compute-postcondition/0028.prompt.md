You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the list. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total number of test cases (an integer greater than 0), `a` will be the last input integer received, and `b` will be the list of integers corresponding to the last input string split by spaces. For each test case, if the first element of `b` is an odd number and does not differ from the second element by 2, or if the last element of `b` is an odd number and does not differ from the second last element by 2, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` with length `n` for each test case, where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and each element `a_j` in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The function also accepts a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. It returns different outputs based on the test cases and the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
