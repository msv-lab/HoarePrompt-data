Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)` - 1, `rest` is `k` - `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` - `delta`.**

Explanation: The variable `rest` is decremented by `delta`. The other variables (`distance`, `pos`, and `rest` with its complex expression) remain unchanged from their initial state.
