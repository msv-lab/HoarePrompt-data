Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that do not fully meet the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Bludgers**: The program does not handle the elimination of players due to Bludgers correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to update player positions, but there is no mechanism to check for Bludger collisions during these movements. According to the problem description, if a player and a Bludger are on the same cell, the player is eliminated. The program should include logic to check for such collisions and eliminate the player accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Quaffle Movement Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the movement of the Quaffle when a player throws it. The Quaffle should remain at the current position of the player after the throw, but the program sets `quidditch[1]` to an empty string, which is incorrect. The Quaffle should stay at the player's position.

3. **Incorrect Elimination Logic**: The program attempts to eliminate players by checking if their position matches the Bludger's position. However, the logic is flawed. The correct approach would be to check if the player is on the same cell as the Bludger and then eliminate the player. The current implementation does not properly handle this scenario.

Here is an example where the program fails to handle Bludger collisions correctly:

### Example Input:
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

### Expected Output:
```
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

### Actual Output (with the provided code):
```
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

In this example, the program correctly identifies that the blue player scores a goal, but it does not handle the Bludger collision correctly. The red player should be eliminated when moving into the same cell as the Bludger, but the program does not account for this.

To fix these issues, the program needs to include proper logic for handling Bludger collisions and Quaffle movements.
