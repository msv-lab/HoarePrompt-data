Postcondition: **All iterations of the loop have been executed, `i` equals `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `curr` is incremented by 1 each time `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 each time `a[i]` is processed. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
