Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is less than `len(a)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. This does not affect the values of `new[i]` or the condition on `i`. Therefore, `new[i]` remains as `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `i` is still less than `len(a)`.
