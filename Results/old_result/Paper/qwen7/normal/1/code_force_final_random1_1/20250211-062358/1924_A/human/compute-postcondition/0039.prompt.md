Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ss` is the first character of the string `s`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the first character of the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 2, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is the first character of the string `s` plus `ss`, and the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` holds true if `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\); otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged and `cnt` is still 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` + 1. If `cur` equals \(2^{k} - 1\), then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the first character of the string `s` plus the next character in `s` plus the value of `ss`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur_ss`, and `ans` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
