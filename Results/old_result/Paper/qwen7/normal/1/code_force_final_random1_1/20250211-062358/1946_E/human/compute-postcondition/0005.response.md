Output State: **The program returns the second return value of func_1(b, a) and the first return value of func_1(b, a)**

This means that the function `func_1(b, a)` was called with parameters `b` and `a`, and it returned two values. The program then returns these two values as a tuple, with the second return value coming first and the first return value following it.
