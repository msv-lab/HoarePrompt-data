Based on the initial state provided, the variable `nx` is constructed based on conditions inside a loop for each iteration from 1 to \( n \). Since no specific conditions or construction details are given for `nx`, we can only describe it in a general form.

The loop runs from 1 to \( n \), and during each iteration, some operation is performed to construct the string `nx`. Without more specific details about the operations within the loop, we can only say that `nx` is a string that accumulates some value or values over these iterations.

Given this information, the print statement will output the final value of `nx` after the loop has completed.

Output: **nx (the final value of `nx` after the loop has completed)**
