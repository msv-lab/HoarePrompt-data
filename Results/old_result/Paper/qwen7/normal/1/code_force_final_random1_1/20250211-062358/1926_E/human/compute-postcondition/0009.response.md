Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. Since `n` must be at least 3, the value of `m` will be `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
