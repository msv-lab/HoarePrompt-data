Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions defined in the program do not perform any operations related to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not:

1. Read the input as specified (number of test cases, size of the array, and the array itself).
2. Implement the logic to find the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

The functions listed are utility functions that do not contribute to solving the problem at hand. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
