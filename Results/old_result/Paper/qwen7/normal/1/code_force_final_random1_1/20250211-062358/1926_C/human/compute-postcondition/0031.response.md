Output State: `i` is "400003", `j` is "3", `pd['400003']` is 400012.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Initially, `i` is "400003" and `j` is the first character "4". After the first iteration, `pd['400003']` becomes 400007. In the second iteration, `j` becomes "0" and `pd['400003']` becomes 400007 + 0 = 400007. In the third iteration, `j` becomes "0" again and `pd['400003']` becomes 400007 + 0 = 400007. In the fourth iteration, `j` becomes "0" again and `pd['400003']` becomes 400007 + 0 = 400007. In the fifth iteration, `j` becomes "0" again and `pd['400003']` becomes 400007 + 0 = 400007. Finally, in the sixth and last iteration, `j` becomes "3" and `pd['400003']` becomes 400007 + 3 = 400010. However, since the output state after the third iteration already shows `pd['400003']` as 400008, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or an error in the provided states. Given the pattern, if we continue from the third iteration, `pd['400003']` should become 400008 + 4 = 400012 after the loop completes all iterations.
