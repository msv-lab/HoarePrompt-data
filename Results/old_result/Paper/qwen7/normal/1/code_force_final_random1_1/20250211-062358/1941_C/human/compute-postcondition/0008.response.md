Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states.
