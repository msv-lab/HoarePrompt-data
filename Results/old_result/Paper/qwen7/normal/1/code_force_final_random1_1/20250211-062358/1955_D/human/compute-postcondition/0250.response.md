Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `m-1`. This means `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b_values` is a list of integers.
   - `curr` is incremented by 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` is some integer, likely the value of `i` at the start of the previous iteration).
   - If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 2`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b_values` remains unchanged.
   - `curr` remains unchanged.
   - `i` changes to `k + 2`.
   - The condition for decrementing `cnt_b[a[i]]` will be checked again with `i = k + 2`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `curr` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k + 2`, and if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**
