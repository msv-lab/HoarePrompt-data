Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`.
- `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop.
- `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4.
- `q` is 0.
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`.
- `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`.
- `mp` is a dictionary with keys being cumulative XOR results and values being lists of indices where these results occur in `a`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` multiplied by the number of iterations.
- `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `v1` and `v2` are lists retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])` and `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` respectively.
- `it1` and `it2` are indices used to check the conditions for appending 'YES' or 'NO' to `results`.
- `results` now has an empty string appended to it.

The key point here is that `results` is a list that contains 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions, but the exact conditions and values of `r` and `l` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact content of `results`.

Given this, the print statement `print('\n'.join(results))` will join all the strings in the `results` list into a single string, separated by newlines, and then print it.

Since the exact content of `results` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of its structure and contents.

Output: **'\n'.join(results) (where results is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions specified in the loop)**
