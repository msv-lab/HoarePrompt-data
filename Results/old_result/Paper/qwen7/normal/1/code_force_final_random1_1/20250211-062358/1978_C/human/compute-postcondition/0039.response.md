Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `k` is `-2n + 6`, `x` is `l[-2]`, the second element of list `l` is the original third last element of list `l`, and list `l` has an additional element inserted at index `-k`.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still `n-4`.
- The variable `k` is updated to `-2n + 6` because `k` was originally `k - 2n + 4`, and now it is recalculated as `k - 2n + 4 + 2n - 4 = -2n + 6`.
- The variable `x` remains unchanged and is still `l[-2]`.
- The second element of list `l` is now the original third last element of list `l`, which means the list `l` has undergone a change where its second element has been replaced by the third last element.
- The code `l.insert(-k, x)` inserts the value of `x` into list `l` at the index `-k`, which is `-(-2n + 6) = 2n - 6`. Therefore, the list `l` now has an additional element inserted at this position.
