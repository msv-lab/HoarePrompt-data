Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and the structure of `u2vs` represents a valid tree.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` being an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\) remains true, and the list `u2vs` representing a valid tree structure is not affected by this input operation.
