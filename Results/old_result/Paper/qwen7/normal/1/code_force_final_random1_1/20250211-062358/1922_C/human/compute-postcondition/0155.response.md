Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2`. This means `i` should be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration and should remain within this range.

3. **Determine the new state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop is to execute again, `i` should be `i + 1`.

4. **Ensure `i` remains within the valid range**: Since the loop runs from `1` to `n - 2`, `i` must be between `1` and `n - 2` inclusive. After incrementing `i` by 1, it should still satisfy this condition.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - `n` should remain unchanged as it is a constant defining the upper limit of the loop.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`d1[i + 2]` is set based on the conditions provided, `i` is incremented by 1 and remains within the range `1` to `n-2`, `n` remains the same**.

To explicitly state the updated values:

State: **`d1[i + 2]` is set based on the conditions provided, `i` is 2 (if previously `i` was 1), `n` must be greater than 2, and `n` remains the same**.
