Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `l`, `array`, or `rev_array`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
