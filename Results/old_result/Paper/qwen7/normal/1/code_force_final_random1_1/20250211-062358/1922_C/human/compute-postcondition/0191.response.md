Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.

4. **Analyze the loop behavior**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0 and `m` must be greater than 0, the loop will execute if `m > 0`.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - After each iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - `m` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no changes are mentioned, `m` stays the same.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.
