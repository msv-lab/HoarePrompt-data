Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `smin` is a list where each element represents the minimum suffix sum up to that index in the list `l`, and `sm` is -111. The suffix sum `suf[i]` minus the minimum suffix sum at index `i` (`smin[i]`) is greater than the current value of `sm` or `sm` is -111.
