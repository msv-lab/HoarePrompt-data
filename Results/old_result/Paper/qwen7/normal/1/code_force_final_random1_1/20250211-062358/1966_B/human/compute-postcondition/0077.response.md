Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `j < m - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `tc` is 2
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans` is 'YES'
   - `impossible` is False
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements
   - The first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr`
   - `m` must be greater than 1
   - `j` is 0

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0, and the loop condition is `j < m - 1`, the loop will execute again if `m > 1`.
   - After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `tc` remains 2
   - `i` remains 0
   - `ans` remains 'YES'
   - `impossible` remains False
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1
   - `gr` remains a list containing `n` elements, with the same properties (first element not equal to the last element)
   - `m` remains greater than 1
   - `j` becomes 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
