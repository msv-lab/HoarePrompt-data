You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of integers. Each integer represents the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. For each test case, it processes a string of problem difficulties and determines how many more problems are required to meet the specified number of upcoming rounds (`m`). The calculation involves counting the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') across all problems in the test cases, then determining the shortfall between the required number of problems (`m`) and the current count (`f`) for each difficulty level. The function sums these shortfalls to produce the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `m`, and `a`.
3. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using a list `freq` of size 7.
4. It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds by calculating `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` and summing these values.
5. Finally, it appends the total number of missing problems to the `results` list.
6. The loop iterates over all test cases and returns the list of results.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case.
