Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**: We know that `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(a) - 1` because the loop condition is `range(1, len(a))`.
3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop checks the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i-1]`. Based on the difference, it updates `ans` and potentially modifies `tmp`.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, let's analyze what happens at the end of each iteration:

- `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `len(a) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `1 <= k < len(a) - 1`).

For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Now, let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- **`i`**: It will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `k + 1`.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` depends on the difference between `a[k]` and `a[k-1]`. Since we don't have the exact value of `ans` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `ans` might have been updated based on the difference.
- **`tmp`**: The value of `tmp` depends on the difference between `a[k]` and `a[k-1]`. Similarly, since we don't have the exact value of `tmp` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `tmp` might have been updated.

Since we need to provide the state at the start of the next iteration, we focus on the variables directly involved in the loop head and the conditions that determine the loop continuation.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should include:

- `i` incremented by 1.
- `ans` might have been updated but we cannot specify its exact value without knowing the difference.
- `tmp` might have been updated but we cannot specify its exact value without knowing the difference.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an integer that might have been updated, `tmp` is a list that might have been updated**.

However, since we need to provide a specific state format, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an integer, `tmp` is a list**.

This format captures the essential variables and their potential changes without making assumptions about the exact values of `ans` and `tmp`.
