Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2, the first three elements of list `a` are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). If `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]` which is equal to `a[2]` and `a[0]` is an odd number, then `cnt` is further incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt += math.floor(x / 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list that must contain at least 3 elements, the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list that must contain at least 3 elements, the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the next element `x` by 2, and `cnt` is now equal to the original `cnt` plus the floor division of `x` by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list that must contain at least 4 elements, the first four elements of `a` are equal and odd, the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the fourth element of `a` by 2, and `cnt` is now `cnt + math.floor(a[3] / 2)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
