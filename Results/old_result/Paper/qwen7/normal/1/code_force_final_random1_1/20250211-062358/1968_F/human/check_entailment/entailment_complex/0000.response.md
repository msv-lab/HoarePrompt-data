Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for handling large inputs within the constraints.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n` and `q`.
   - It initializes the prefix XOR array (`pf`) and a dictionary (`mp`) to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - It populates the prefix XOR array and updates the dictionary accordingly.
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR value for the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR value is zero, the subarray is automatically interesting.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a split point within the subarray that satisfies the condition by using binary search on the indices stored in the dictionary.

3. **Output**: The program collects the results for all queries and prints them out.

Given the detailed state annotations and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. There are no apparent logical errors or missing steps.

Correctness: **True**
