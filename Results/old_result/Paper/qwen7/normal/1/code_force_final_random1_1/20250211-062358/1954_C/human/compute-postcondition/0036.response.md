Output State: **`new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `new` is updated such that `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so now `i+1` is the new index being considered. The conditions and relationships between the variables `new2`, `new`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as before, just shifted by one index.
