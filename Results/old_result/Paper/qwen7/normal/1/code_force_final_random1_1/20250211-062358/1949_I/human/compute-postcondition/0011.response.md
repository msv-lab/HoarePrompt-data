Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `x[3]`, `y[3]`, `r[3]` are input integers**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` is initially 3, these assignments update the values of `x[3]`, `y[3]`, and `r[3]`. The values of `i` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remain unchanged.
