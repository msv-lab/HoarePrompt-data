Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for s in [*open(0)][1:]:`. Here, the object being iterated over is `s`.

2. **Understand the source of `s`**: The expression `[*open(0)][1:]` reads from standard input (file descriptor 0) and processes the input. It creates a list of strings where each string represents a line of input. The `[1:]` part skips the first element (which is typically the header or some initial data).

3. **Determine what `s` contains**: Each `s` in the loop will be a string representing a line of input. This line will contain three space-separated non-negative integers corresponding to `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Initial state**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means there will be `t` lines of input.

5. **Adjusting the state**: For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the input is correctly formatted and available. Specifically, we need to ensure that there are at least `t` lines of input available, and each line should be in the correct format (three non-negative integers separated by spaces).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range.
- There must be exactly `t` lines of input available, each containing three non-negative integers separated by spaces.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and there are exactly `t` lines of input, each containing three non-negative integers separated by spaces**.
