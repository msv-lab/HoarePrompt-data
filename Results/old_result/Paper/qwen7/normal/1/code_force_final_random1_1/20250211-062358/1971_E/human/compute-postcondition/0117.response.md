Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `l` is the only variable in the loop head.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**: 
   - `q` is `len(a) - a[s - 1]`
   - `l` is `0`
   - `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`
   - `i` is `1`
   - `s` is `bisect_left(a, q)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `l < q`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `0`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1, so `l` becomes `1`.
   - The other variables (`q`, `m`, `i`, and `s`) do not change within the loop head and are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`q` is `len(a) - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `1`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `i` is `1`, `s` is `bisect_left(a, q)`**
