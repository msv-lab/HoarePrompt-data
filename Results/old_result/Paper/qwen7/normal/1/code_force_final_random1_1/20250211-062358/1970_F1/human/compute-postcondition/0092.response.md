Output State: **`ind` is 1, `elements[line[0]]` is `i, 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `elements` dictionary with the key `line[ind]` (which is not '..' and currently points to the first element of the list `line`), setting its value to the tuple `(i, ind)`. Since `ind` was initially 0, after executing the line `ind` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `ind` becomes 1. The value of `elements[line[0]]` is set to `i, 1`.
