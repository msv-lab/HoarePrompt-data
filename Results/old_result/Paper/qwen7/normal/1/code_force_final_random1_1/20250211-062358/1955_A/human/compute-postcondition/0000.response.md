Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Initially, `i` is set to 0 when the loop starts.

4. **Determine the initial state of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is determined by the user input, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the given constraints.

5. **Constraints analysis**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).

6. **Loop execution condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, since `t` is the number of test cases, we should reflect this in our state.

### Final State Adjustment

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**

This ensures that the loop can execute for at least one iteration, given the constraints.
