Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The value of `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than or equal to `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is the sum of `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to 0 plus `a_values[0]`. If `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `custo` is an integer. If `y` is 1, `custo` is the sum of `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to 0 plus `a_values[0]`. If `y` is `max_p - 2`, `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`. For other values of `y`, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`, depending on whether `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, with no additional changes if `y` is neither 1 nor `max_p - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `custo` is an integer, and `y` is one less than its final value after the if-else block. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is true, then `custo` is incremented by the value of `b_values[y]`, and `y` is updated to one less than the new value of `custo`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further incremented by `a_values[0]`. If the condition is false, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[y]`, `y` is updated to one less than the new value of `custo`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
