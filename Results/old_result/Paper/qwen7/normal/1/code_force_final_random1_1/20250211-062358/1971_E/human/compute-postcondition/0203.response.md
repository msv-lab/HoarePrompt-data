Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for l in range(q)`. The variables involved here are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`
   - `q` is equal to `len(a)`
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`
   - `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`
   - `l` is `q`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `l < q`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is equal to `q`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1, making it `q + 1`.
   - Since `q` remains unchanged, `q` still equals `len(a)`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l`, which should be `q + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q + 1`**
