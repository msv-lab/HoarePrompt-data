Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case.
   - It initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - For each character in the string `a`, it increments the corresponding index in the `freq` array.
   - It then calculates the shortfall for each difficulty level by subtracting the current count (`f`) from the required number of rounds (`m`). If the result is negative, it means there are enough problems for that difficulty level, so the value is set to 0.
   - The function sums these shortfalls to get the total number of additional problems needed for the current test case.
   - This process is repeated for each test case, and the results are stored in a list.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided in the execution summary match the expected input format and the function correctly processes them.
   - For the first test case (10, 1, 'BGECDCBDED'), the function correctly identifies that 2 additional problems ('A' and 'F') are needed.
   - For the second test case (10, 2, 'BGECDCBDED'), the function correctly identifies that 5 additional problems are needed.
   - For the third test case (9, 1, 'BBCDEFFGG'), the function correctly identifies that 1 additional problem ('A') is needed.

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem description and the execution summary, and it produces the correct results for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
