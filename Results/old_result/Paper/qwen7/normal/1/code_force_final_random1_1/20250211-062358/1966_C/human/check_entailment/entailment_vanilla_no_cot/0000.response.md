Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic in the `dp` variable is flawed. It does not correctly implement the Nim Game strategy.
   - The Nim Game's winning condition is determined by the XOR of the sizes of the piles. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

2. **Unnecessary Sorting and Set Conversion:**
   - The code sorts the unique elements of the piles and adds a zero at the end. This is unnecessary and complicates the logic.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Piles:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the difference between consecutive elements and uses this to determine the winner, which is not the correct approach for the Nim Game.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        # Calculate the XOR of all pile sizes
        xor_result = 0
        for pile_size in arr:
            xor_result ^= pile_size
        
        # Determine the winner based on the XOR result
        if xor_result == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
        tc -= 1

func()
```

This solution correctly implements the Nim Game strategy by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes and determining the winner based on the result.
