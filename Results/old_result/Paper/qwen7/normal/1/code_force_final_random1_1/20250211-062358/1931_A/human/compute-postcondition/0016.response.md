Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
   - Postcondition: 
     - If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is "zzzzzz".
     - If `n` is greater than 26, `word` is 'az'.
     - Otherwise, `word` is 'aaa'.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(int(input()))`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

4. **Determining the New Value of `n`:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on the value of `int(input())`, we need to determine what value of `int(input())` would allow the loop to continue.
   - For the loop to continue, `int(input())` must be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **Determining the Value of `word`:**
   - The value of `word` does not change within the loop itself; it is determined by the initial conditions.
   - Therefore, the value of `word` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `i` will be 1.
- `n` must be an integer greater than 1 (to allow the loop to continue).
- The value of `word` remains the same as per the initial postcondition.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `word` is determined by the initial postcondition**.
