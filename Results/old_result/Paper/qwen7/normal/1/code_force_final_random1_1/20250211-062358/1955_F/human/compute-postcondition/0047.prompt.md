Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `cnt` is 15.

Explanation: Given that the loop increments `cnt` by `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`, and the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, we can deduce the total increment to `cnt`. Since each of the first three elements is odd, `math.floor(x / 2)` will add 0 or 1 to `cnt` depending on whether `x` is 1 or greater than 1. However, since the problem does not specify any further changes to the list `a` beyond the first three elements, we assume these three elements remain constant throughout the loop's execution. The output state after the loop completes all iterations would thus have `cnt` incremented by 10 (since each of the first three elements contributes either 0 or 1 to `cnt`, and there are three such elements, making a total of 5 increments per full cycle of the loop through the first three elements, and if we assume the loop runs until all elements are processed, and given the pattern, it would be 15 in total).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The list `a` contains integers where the first three elements are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). The variable `x` takes on each value from the list `a` in sequence, starting with the first element. The variable `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2 for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `cnt` will be the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2, starting from the first element.

In natural language, this means that `cnt` will hold the total sum of half of each element in the list `a`, rounded down, after the loop has completed all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list where all elements are equal and odd, the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `cnt` is the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
