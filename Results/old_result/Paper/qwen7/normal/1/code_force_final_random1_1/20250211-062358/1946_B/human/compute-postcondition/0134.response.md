Output State: **`sm` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `t` is the same as before, `n` is the first element of the list `l`, `k` is the second element of the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from input, `suf` is [0].**

The code `suf.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `suf`. Since `suf` was initially an empty list, after appending `0`, `suf` becomes `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
