Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [2, 0, 1], `pow` is 4, `tot` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2, changing its value from the initial state where it was implicitly 2 (since it was multiplied by 2) to 4. All other variables (`a`, `L`, and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
