Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr**.

Explanation: The variable `impossible` is directly set to `True` in the code. However, since the initial state already sets `impossible` to `True`, setting it again to `True` does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `impossible` remains `True` in the output state. But since the code simply reassigns `impossible` without any conditions, it can be interpreted as `impossible` being set to `False` in the context of the problem, leading to the updated state where `impossible` is `False`. All other variables retain their initial values.
