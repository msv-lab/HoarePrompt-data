Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n` with each element initialized to 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = [0] * n` initializes a new list `a` of length `n` where each element is set to 0. The original list `a` of length `k` with each element initialized to 1000 is no longer relevant after this assignment. The list `x` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
