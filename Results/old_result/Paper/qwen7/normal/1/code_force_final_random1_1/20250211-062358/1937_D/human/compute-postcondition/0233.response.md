Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `r` is `r - 1`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `b` is expressed as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.
