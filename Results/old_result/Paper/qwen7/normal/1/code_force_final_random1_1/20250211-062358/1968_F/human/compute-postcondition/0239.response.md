Postcondition: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` contains 'YES', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `x == 0` is true, then `results` is set to 'YES' and `l` and `r` are updated as specified. If the condition is false, the else part does not change the state of the variables, so the same conditions apply.
