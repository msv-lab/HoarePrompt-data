Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` will be equal to `n - m`, `cnt_b[i]` will be 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. It does not affect the list `b_values` or the dictionary `cnt_b`. The value of `i` is calculated as `n - m` and `cnt_b[i]` is set to 0. The initial conditions for `b_values` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged.
