Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 2. Initially, `g` was `int(n / 2) - 1`. After the operation, `g` becomes `int(n / 2) - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
