Output State: **`nx` is now the string 'xx[i][j - 1]', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `j` is 1, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to include this value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
