Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is either `2` or updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` for each `i` from `n-2` down to 0, depending on whether the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` holds. `d1[n + 1]` is the sum of `d1[2]` (which is 1) and the number of times the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-2`, plus the cumulative differences `l[i + 1] - l[i]` when the condition does not hold.
