Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a', the current value of `cur` is equal to 2^k - 1 where k is some integer, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

In this case, the code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was previously equal to \(2^k - 1\), after executing this line of code, `cnt` will now be \(2^k\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
