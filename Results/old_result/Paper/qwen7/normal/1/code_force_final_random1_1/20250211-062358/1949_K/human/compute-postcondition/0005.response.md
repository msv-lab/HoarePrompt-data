The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, the function `distribute_number(num)` was called with the argument `num`. For the loop to execute again, `num` must be one of the elements in the `numbers` list.

Since the exact value of `num` from the previous iteration is not specified, we can only say that it was one of the elements in the `numbers` list. To proceed to the next iteration, `num` must be another element in the `numbers` list.

State: **The function `distribute_number(num)` is called with an argument that is one of the elements in the `numbers` list.**
