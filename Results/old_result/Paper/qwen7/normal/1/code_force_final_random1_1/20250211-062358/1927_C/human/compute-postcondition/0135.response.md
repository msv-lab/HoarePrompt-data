Postcondition: `i` is 3, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `aOnes` is either `bOnes + 1` (if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`), or `bOnes` (if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`), and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. In both the if and else cases, `i`, `bOnes`, `aOnes`, and `k` retain their original values.
