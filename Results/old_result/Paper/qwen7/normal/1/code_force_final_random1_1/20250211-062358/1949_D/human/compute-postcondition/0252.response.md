Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` remains the same
   - `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`
   - `nx` is either `'FF'` if either `i` or 3 is in the first quarter of `sa`, or a string with an additional 'S' appended to it otherwise.

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `j` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `4`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j < n + 1`. Given that `j` is currently `3`, the next iteration will occur when `j` becomes `4`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented to `4`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `xx[i][0]` remains `'?'` because the loop body does not modify this value.
   - `nx` remains either `'FF'` if either `i` or `4` is in the first quarter of `sa`, or a string with an additional 'S' appended to it otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `j` is 4, `n` remains the same, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, and `nx` is either `'FF'` if either `i` or 4 is in the first quarter of `sa`, or a string with an additional 'S' appended to it otherwise.**
