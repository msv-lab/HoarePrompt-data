Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**.

This means that the variable `gap` is calculated as the difference between `next_elem` and `a[i]` minus 1. The values of `i`, `x`, and `next_elem` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and `gap` now holds the computed value based on these conditions.
