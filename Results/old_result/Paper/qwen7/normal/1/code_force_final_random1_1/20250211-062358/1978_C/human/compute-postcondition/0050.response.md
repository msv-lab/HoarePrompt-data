Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12. It returns a list `l` that is initially a range of integers from 1 to `n`. The function manipulates this list based on the value of `k` through a series of conditional checks and list operations. If `k` becomes zero before the loop completes, the function returns the partially manipulated list. Otherwise, after the loop completes, the list is fully reversed, and `k` is reset to 0. Depending on the value of `k`, the function can insert elements, update indices, or reverse the list.**
