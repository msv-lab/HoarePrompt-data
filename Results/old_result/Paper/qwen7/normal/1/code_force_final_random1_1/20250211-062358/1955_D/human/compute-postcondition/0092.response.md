Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index such that `i + 1` is within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `b_values`, `curr`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state. The only changes are to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, which is now decremented by 1, and `ans`, which may be incremented by 1 depending on the condition involving `curr` and `k`.
