Output State: `i` is `-1`, `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`, and `ar` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will become `-1` because the loop decrements `i` starting from `len(ar) - 1` until it reaches `-1`. The value of `mex` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is only modified within the if condition which does not alter `mex` if the condition is false. The list `res` is filled such that for each index `i`, `res[i]` equals `mex - ar[i]`. The list `ar` remains unaltered as it is not modified within the loop.
