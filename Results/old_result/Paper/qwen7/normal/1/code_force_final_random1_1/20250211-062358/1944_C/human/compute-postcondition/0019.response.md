Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `start` is 1.
   - `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 1`. Since `nums[0]` is not explicitly given, let's assume it is initially set to some value, say `x`. After this operation, `nums[0]` becomes `x - 1`.
   - `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1.
   - The current value of `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1. Since `start` is 1, `nums[start + 1]` refers to `nums[2]`. So, `nums[2]` is decreased by 1.
   - `nums[1]` is not zero.
   - `nums[0]` is decreased by 1 again, so `nums[0]` becomes `(x - 1) - 1 = x - 2`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(start + 1)`.
   - Given that `start` is 1, `start + 1` evaluates to 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2**
