Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping int to the input split.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then maps the `int` function over each element of the list to convert them into integers. The resulting list of integers is stored in `l`. The values of `t` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `k` remains unchanged as well since it was defined before the code was executed.
