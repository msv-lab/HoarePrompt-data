Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` evaluates to 0, and `tmp` is either 'a' or 'b', depending on whether the if condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` is met or not. If the condition is true, `tmp` becomes 'b', and if the condition is false, `tmp` remains 'a'.
