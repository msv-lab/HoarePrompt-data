Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string and prints their sum. However, this approach does not account for overlapping occurrences or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie". The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a total of 2 deletions. However, the optimal solution is to delete only 2 characters (the 4th and 9th characters), which would result in the string "mmnapie", making it beautiful with only 2 deletions.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through the string and remove characters dynamically to ensure that no "map" or "pie" substrings remain.
