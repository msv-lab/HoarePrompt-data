You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        d = n
        
        h = n
        
        p = 1
        
        g = 0
        
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases specified by `t` are processed. After all iterations, the final output will depend on the last test case's values of `n` and `k`. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, the final state will be that `s` is the sum of all values added to it during each iteration of the loop, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is 1, `g` is the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, `f` is \(k - g\), and `y` is calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times (k - g) - 1)\). If `k \leq (n + 1) // 2`, then `s` remains 0, `i` remains 0, `d` remains `n`, `h` remains `n`, `p` remains 1, `g` remains 0, and `f` remains \(k - g\).
    #
    #The final output for each test case will be printed as `y`, which is determined based on whether `k` is greater than or less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case contains integers t, n, and k such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it processes these integers and returns a value based on the given constraints.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
