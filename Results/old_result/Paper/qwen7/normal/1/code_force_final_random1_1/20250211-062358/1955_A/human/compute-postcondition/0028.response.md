Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value, `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value, `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value, `X` is `A // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A` divided by 2 (integer division) to `X`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `X` is specifically the integer result of dividing `A` by 2.
