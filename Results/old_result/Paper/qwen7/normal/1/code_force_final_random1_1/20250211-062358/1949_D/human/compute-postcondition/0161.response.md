Output State: **`nx` is equal to the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it implies that `xx[i][j - 1]` holds a numeric value. The conditions on `n` remain unchanged as the code does not affect `n`.
