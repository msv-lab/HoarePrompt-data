Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `rev[tmp] != []`. This means the loop will continue as long as `rev[tmp]` is not an empty list.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `one` is True
   - `two` is True
   - `tmp` is the last element of `rev[rev[tmp]]`

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on `rev[tmp]`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `rev[tmp]` is not an empty list for the loop to execute again.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - We know `tmp` is the last element of `rev[rev[tmp]]`. However, this information alone does not guarantee that `rev[tmp]` is not an empty list. We need to ensure that `rev[tmp]` contains at least one element.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `rev[tmp]` to ensure it is not an empty list.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is `rev[tmp]` should not be an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`one` is True, `two` is True, `rev[tmp]` is not an empty list**
