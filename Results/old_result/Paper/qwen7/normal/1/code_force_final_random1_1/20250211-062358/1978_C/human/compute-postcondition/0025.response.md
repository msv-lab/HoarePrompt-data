Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - (n - 4) + 1`, `c` is `c + 3`, `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`**

Explanation: 
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially `n - 4`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - (n - 4) + 1`, which is the same as `k - n + 5`.
- The value of `c` is incremented by 1, making it `c + 1 + 2`, which simplifies to `c + 3`.
- The value of `l` remains the return value of `func_3(c, l)`, as the function call is not re-evaluated here.
