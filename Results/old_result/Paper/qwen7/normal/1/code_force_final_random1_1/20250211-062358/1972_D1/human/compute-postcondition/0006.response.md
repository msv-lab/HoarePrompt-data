Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). During each iteration, `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` will write a positive integer to the standard output, and after all iterations, the output will consist of `t` lines, each containing a positive integer.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be `t` lines, each line containing a positive integer as written by `func_15()` during each iteration of the loop.
