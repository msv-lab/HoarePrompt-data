Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the new input received, `t` remains the same, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input received, `b` is a sorted string of the unique characters from the new input received.**

Explanation: The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the characters in the string `s` and joins them back into a string. The sorting does not affect the other variables, so they remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is created and assigned the value of the sorted string of `s`.
