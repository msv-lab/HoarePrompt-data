Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of the current value of `j` in the reversed `array` (starting from `j` to the end of the array) and then indexing into the `alp` list with that count minus one, `i` is incremented by 1 to `i+1`, `array` is a list of integers input by the user, `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`**.

Explanation: The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` creates a new list `rev_array` which is the reversed version of the original `array`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, or `alp`. The `array` itself remains unchanged.
