Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state after the previous iteration**:
   - `sm` is an integer (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `j` is `j_prev + 1` (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `t` is the same as before (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `i` is `j` (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `suf` has an additional element which is `suf[i] + l[i]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `j`, and the loop will increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `j + 1` in the next iteration.
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `sm` remains unchanged.
   - `j` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` changes to `j + 1`.
   - `suf` will have an additional element, but since we are only concerned with the loop head variables, we do not need to explicitly state this change here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`sm` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `j + 1`, `suf` has an additional element which is `suf[i] + l[i]`**.

However, since we are only adjusting the states of the loop head variables (`i` and `n`), the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**.
