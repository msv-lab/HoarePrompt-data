Output State: **All elements in the list `u2vs` will contain pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between indices; variables `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` calls the `bfs` function with the argument `0`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `d` and `_` respectively. The underscore `_` is a common convention to indicate that the second return value is not used. The initial state of the list `u2vs` remains unchanged, but now it contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between indices as per the BFS traversal starting from index `0`. The variables `d` and `_` hold the respective return values from the `bfs` function.
