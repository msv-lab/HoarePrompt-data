Based on the initial state described:

- `pk` is an integer.
- `mini` is an integer.
- `final` is a list.

The behavior of `final` is determined by the following conditions:
- If `final` is empty, it remains empty.
- If `final` is not empty, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
  - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains `[0]`.
  - If `c1` is less than 50, `final` contains `[n]`.

Given this, let's analyze the possible scenarios for `final`:

1. **If `final` is empty:**
   - In this case, `final[0]` would result in an IndexError because `final` does not contain any elements.
   - Since the question asks for what is printed and assuming the code handles such cases gracefully, it might print an error message or simply nothing.

2. **If `final` is not empty:**
   - `final` can either be `[0]` or `[n]` depending on the value of `c1`.
   - `final[0]` will be either `0` or `n`.

Since the exact values of `o`, `n`, and the contents of `final` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `final[0]`. However, we can describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions provided.

Output: **0 or n (depending on the value of c1, where c1 = o * 100 // n)**
