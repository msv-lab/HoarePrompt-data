Output State: **`x` is an array, `a[i]` is an integer, `b[j_end + 1]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j_end + 2`, `b[j]` is incremented by 1, and `n` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Initially, `b[j]` was equal to `b[j_end + 1]`. After the increment, `b[j]` now equals `b[j_end + 1] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
