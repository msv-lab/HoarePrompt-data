N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M characters. Each character in the string can be one of the following: '.', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', or '.Q'. The integers P, T are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10 and 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.
