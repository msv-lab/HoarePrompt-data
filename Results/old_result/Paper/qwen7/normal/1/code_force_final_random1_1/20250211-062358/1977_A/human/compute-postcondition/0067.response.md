Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is 99 (since the loop runs t times), n is the first integer from the input split, m is the second integer from the input split, and the values of n and m remain unchanged regardless of the conditions checked within the loop.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will hold the final value it was initialized to, `i` will be `t-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`), and `n` and `m` will retain their last input values from the final iteration of the loop. The conditions inside the loop do not alter the values of `n` and `m`, so they stay as they were in the last input provided.
