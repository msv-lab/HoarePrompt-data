Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)` and equals `i+1`, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i+1`. All other variables remain unchanged, including the conditions and values they hold.
