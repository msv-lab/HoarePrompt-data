Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t = t - 1\), `_` is 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The value of `t` is updated to `t - 1`, but since `t` was initially set to `t - 1`, it remains unchanged. The value of `_` stays as 2. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers input by the user. The condition regarding `b` being even or odd and the assignment to `b1` and `b2` is not directly affected by this line of code, so the initial conditions for those variables remain as described in the initial state.
