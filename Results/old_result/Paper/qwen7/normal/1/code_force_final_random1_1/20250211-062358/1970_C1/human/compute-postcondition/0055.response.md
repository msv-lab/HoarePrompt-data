Output State: **`tree[current]` is not empty, `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `visited` includes the `neighbor`, `queue` includes (neighbor, dist + 1)**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. The `neighbor` is already known to be not in `visited`, and `visited` includes the `neighbor`. The value of `dist` is not specified, but it is used to calculate the second element of the tuple being added to `queue`. The `current` tree node and its structure remain unchanged.
