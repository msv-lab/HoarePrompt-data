Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is the total length of the string `s`, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution.**
