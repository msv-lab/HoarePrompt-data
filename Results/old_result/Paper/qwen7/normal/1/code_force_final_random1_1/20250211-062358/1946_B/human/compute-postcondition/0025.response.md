Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split.
   - `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `l`.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is updated to `[0, suf[i + 1]]`. Otherwise, `smin` remains unchanged as a list with one additional element which is equal to `smin[i]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - Since `i` was less than `n` in the previous iteration, `i + 1` will still be within the bounds of the list `l` (assuming the loop does not terminate prematurely).

4. **Updating the States:**
   - `suf` and `smin` will be updated based on the condition inside the loop. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we don't need to consider the exact updates to `suf` and `smin` yet.
   - The only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted is `i`.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `suf` and `smin` will be updated inside the loop but their exact values are not required for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is less than `n`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

To summarize the final state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is less than `n` and `i` is incremented by 1, `smin` is either unchanged or updated as described.**
