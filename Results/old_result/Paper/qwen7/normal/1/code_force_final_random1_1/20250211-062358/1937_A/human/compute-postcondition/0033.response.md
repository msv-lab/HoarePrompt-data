The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 3.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`. Since `power` is currently 4, `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, and `power` is 4**
