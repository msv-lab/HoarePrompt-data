The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, we assume that the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - 2 * opNum - 3 * opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`.**
