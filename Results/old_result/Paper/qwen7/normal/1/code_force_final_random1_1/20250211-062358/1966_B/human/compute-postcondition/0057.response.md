Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `tc`, `i`, `ans`, and `impossible` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `tc` is still 2, `i` is still `n - 2`, `ans` is still 'NO', and `impossible` is still True. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers input by the user.
