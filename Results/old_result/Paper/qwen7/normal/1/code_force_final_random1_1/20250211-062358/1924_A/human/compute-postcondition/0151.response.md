Postcondition: `ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is `ss`, `cur` is 0, and `cnt` is incremented by 1. This is because the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is never met, hence the else part does not execute, and the if part always runs, keeping `cur` unchanged at 0.
