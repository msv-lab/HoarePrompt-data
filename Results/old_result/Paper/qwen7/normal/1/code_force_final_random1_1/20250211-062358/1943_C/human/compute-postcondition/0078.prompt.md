You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3, u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and the structure of u2vs represents a valid tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: All elements in the list `u2vs` will contain pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between indices. The final state of `u2vs` will be such that for every pair `(u, v)` entered through the loop, both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will contain each other.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, ..., -1]` (with `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates).
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to append `n` to `path_ba` until `n` equals `-1`. Since the condition for breaking the loop is `if n == -1`, and we know that the loop has executed at least 3 times and `n` is `-1` each time, it implies that `n` will continue to be `-1` in subsequent iterations as well. Therefore, `path_ba` will keep appending `-1` until the loop terminates, which happens when `n` finally becomes `-1` again, satisfying the loop's termination condition. Given that the loop has already executed 3 times and `n` is `-1` each time, it suggests that `n` will remain `-1` for all further iterations, making `path_ba` a list filled with `-1`s.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 1; `ci` is 1; `ops` is a list containing three tuples \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\].
        #
        #In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains unchanged at 1 because the loop's condition `i < ci + 1` evaluates to false when `i` reaches 2 (since `ci` is 1). The variable `ci` also remains unchanged at 1. The list `ops` contains three tuples, each being `(1, 1)`, as the loop appends the same tuple `(c, i)` for each iteration, and since `c` is 1 (the current value of `ci`), and `i` increments from 0 to 1, the list ends up with three identical tuples.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 6; `c1` is unchanged; `ops` now contains the tuples (`c1`, 3), (`c2`, 1), (`c2`, 3), (`c1`, 5), (`c2`, 5), (`c1`, 7), (`c2`, 7).
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs for as many iterations as there are elements in `path_ba` that satisfy the condition `1 <= i < len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2. Given that `path_ba` has an even length and considering the pattern from the first three iterations, we can deduce that the loop will continue until `i` reaches the second last element of `path_ba` (since the length of `path_ba` minus `c1` would be even and `i` increments by 2 each time). Since the loop executed 3 times up to `i` being 5, it will execute one more time with `i` becoming 7, adding the tuples (`c1`, 7) and (`c2`, 7) to `ops`.
    #State: `i` is either 1 or 6, `ci` is either 1 or unchanged, and `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `len(path_ba)` is odd, then `i` is 1, `ci` is 1, and `ops` is a list containing three tuples \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\]. Otherwise, `i` is 6, `ci` is unchanged, and `ops` contains the tuples \[(c1, 3), (c2, 1), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7)\], where `c1` and `c2` are the values they had before the loop.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: 3 or 7 (depending on whether len(path_ba) is odd or even)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: - If `i` is 1:
    #     - `ops` is \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\].
    #     - The lambda function applied to each tuple results in:
    #       - \((1, 1) \rightarrow f'{1 + 1} {1}' = '2 1'\)
    #       - \((1, 1) \rightarrow f'{1 + 1} {1}' = '2 1'\)
    #       - \((1, 1) \rightarrow f'{1 + 1} {1}' = '2 1'\)
    #     - The output will be:
    #       ```
    #       2 1
    #       2 1
    #       2 1
    #       ```
    #   - If `i` is 6:
    #     - `ops` is \[(c1, 3), (c2, 1), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7)\].
    #     - The lambda function applied to each tuple results in:
    #       - \((c1, 3) \rightarrow f'{c1 + 1} {3}' = f'{c1 + 1} 3'\)
    #       - \((c2, 1) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {1}' = f'{c2 + 1} 1'\)
    #       - \((c2, 3) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {3}' = f'{c2 + 1} 3'\)
    #       - \((c1, 5) \rightarrow f'{c1 + 1} {5}' = f'{c1 + 1} 5'\)
    #       - \((c2, 5) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {5}' = f'{c2 + 1} 5'\)
    #       - \((c1, 7) \rightarrow f'{c1 + 1} {7}' = f'{c1 + 1} 7'\)
    #       - \((c2, 7) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {7}' = f'{c2 + 1} 7'\)
    #     - The output will be:
    #       ```
    #       {c1 + 1} 3
    #       {c2 + 1} 1
    #       {c2 + 1} 3
    #       {c1 + 1} 5
    #       {c2 + 1} 5
    #       {c1 + 1} 7
    #       {c2 + 1} 7
    #       ```
    #
    #Given that `i` is either 1 or 6, and since the problem does not specify which case applies, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the most precise answer based on the given conditions is:
    #
    #Output:
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10³, and a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The structure of `u2vs` represents a valid tree. The function does not return any value.
