Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value, `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value, `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value. If `B * 2 < C`, the condition is not met and the program continues as usual. If `B * 2 >= C`, `X` is set to `A // 2` if `A` is even, otherwise `X` remains unchanged.**
