Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is either 1 or 0, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` must be greater than or equal to 1, either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, and `(i not in a or aOnes > newk)`.**

Explanation:
- If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` becomes 1.
- If the condition `i in b and bOnes <= newk` is false, then `bOnes` remains 0.
- In both cases, `aOnes` remains 0, `newk` remains unchanged, and the condition `(i not in a or aOnes > newk)` is maintained. Additionally, if `i` is in `b`, `bOnes` becomes 1.
