Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 500\).
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet, it's mentioned for completeness).
   - `n` is an input integer (its value is unknown but it doesn't affect the calculation directly).
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
   ```

   - `nums[:-1]` refers to all elements of the list `nums` except the last one.
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value among these elements.
   - `nums[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `nums`.
   - The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value from the first \(n-1\) elements of `nums` to the last element of `nums`.

Given the initial state, the exact value of `n` and the contents of `nums` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `nums`.

Output: **max_value + last_value (where max_value is the maximum value among the first n-1 elements of nums and last_value is the last element of nums)**
