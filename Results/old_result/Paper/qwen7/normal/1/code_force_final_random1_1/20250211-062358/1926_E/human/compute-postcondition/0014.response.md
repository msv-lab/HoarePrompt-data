Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is `n - (n + 1 // 2), `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing two elements `[n + 1 // 2, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `n -= m` subtracts `m` from `n`. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
