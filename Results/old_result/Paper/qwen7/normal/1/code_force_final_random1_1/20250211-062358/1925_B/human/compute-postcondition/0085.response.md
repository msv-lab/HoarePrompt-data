Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given code are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i`: The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `x`: The value of `x` remains unchanged within the loop unless modified inside the loop body.
   - `n`: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop unless modified inside the loop body.
   - `ans`: The value of `ans` is updated based on certain conditions.

4. **Conditions for Updating `ans`**:
   - `x % i == 0` must be true.
   - `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` must be true.
   - `x // i > 0` must be true.
   - `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` must be true.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `x` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` may change if the conditions are met during the current iteration.

Given the loop head and the conditions, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `x`. However, since `x` does not change within the loop, we only need to adjust `i`.

6. **New State Calculation**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `x` is the same as before, `n` is the same as before, and `ans` is the same as before**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote it as `k`.

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `x` is the same as before, `n` is the same as before, and `ans` is the same as before**.
