Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. The function processes these test cases and returns results based on the given constraints for t and n.**
