Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 9999
- `_` is 2
- `a` is an integer from the input
- `b` is an integer from the input
- `a1` is `a // 2`
- `a2` is `a // 2`

The `print('Yes')` statement simply prints the string "Yes". The values of `a1` and `a2` are both `a // 2`, but these values are not printed. The only thing being printed is the string "Yes".
