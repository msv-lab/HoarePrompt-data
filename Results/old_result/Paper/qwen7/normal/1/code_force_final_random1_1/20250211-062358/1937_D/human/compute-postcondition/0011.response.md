Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is equal to '>', the length of `idx_A` is now 1 more than before, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.

Explanation: The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. This increases the length of `idx_A` by 1. Since the length of `idx_A` was previously non-zero (as per the precondition), the calculation for `x` remains valid and unchanged by this operation. The other variables (`n`, `s[i]`, and `x`) remain as described in the initial state.
