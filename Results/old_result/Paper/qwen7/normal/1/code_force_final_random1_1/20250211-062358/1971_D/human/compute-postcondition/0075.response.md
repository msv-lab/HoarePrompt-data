Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `s` is a new input string with a length at least 2.
- `count` is 3.
- `flag` is True.
- `j` is incremented by 1 and is now less than or equal to `len(s) - 2`.

The `print(count)` statement will print the value of the variable `count`, which is explicitly stated to be 3.

Output: **3**
