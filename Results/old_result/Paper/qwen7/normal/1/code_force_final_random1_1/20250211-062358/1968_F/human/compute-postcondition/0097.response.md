Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is updated to `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `results` is now appended with an empty string, `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `a` is now a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is now a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `pf` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `pf`, which is now a list of zeros.
