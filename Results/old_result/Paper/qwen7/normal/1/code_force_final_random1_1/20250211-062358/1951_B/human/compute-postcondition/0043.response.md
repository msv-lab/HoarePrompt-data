Postcondition: `ind` is a non-empty list with exactly one element, and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `a` that have not been checked (i.e., `i < n`), and it will stop when `c` reaches 2 or when all elements in `a` have been checked. If `k` equals 14, the loop continues under the same conditions.
