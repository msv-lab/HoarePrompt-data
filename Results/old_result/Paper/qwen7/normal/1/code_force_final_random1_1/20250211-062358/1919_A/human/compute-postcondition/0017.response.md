To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

1. The initial state only contains the `print(result)` statement.
2. There is no definition or assignment of the variable `result` provided in the initial state.

Given this, we cannot determine the value of `result` from the information provided. Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will simply be the value of `result`, but since we do not know what `result` is, we can only describe it as such.

Output: **result**
