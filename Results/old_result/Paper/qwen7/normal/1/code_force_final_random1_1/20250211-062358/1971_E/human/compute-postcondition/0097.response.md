Output State: **`i` is at least 1; `len(b)` must be at least 1; `v` contains a new element which is the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Since `i` is at least 1 and `len(b)` must be at least 1, these conditions remain true. The value of `v` changes by adding the computed value.
