### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the GCD of their difficulties is maximized.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the GCD, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems. This means we need to check potential divisors of `x` and see if they can form `n` sub-problems with the remaining part also being divisible by the divisor.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over potential divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
     - If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`.
   - It updates the answer `ans` with the maximum GCD found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where `i` is a perfect square root of `x` separately.
   - It ensures that the remaining part after subtracting `n * i` or `n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by the respective divisor.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the largest possible GCD by checking all potential divisors and ensuring the remaining parts are valid.
   - The use of the square root optimization is efficient and ensures that all divisors are considered without unnecessary iterations.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. Therefore, the program is correct.
