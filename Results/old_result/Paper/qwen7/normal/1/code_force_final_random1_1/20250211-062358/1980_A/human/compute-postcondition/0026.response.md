Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `freq` shows the count of each character ('A' to 'Z') in the original `a`, `missing` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `t` is reduced by the number of elements originally in `a`, and `n`, `m`, and `a` retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(missing)` appends the current value of `missing` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after this line, `results` will contain the value of `missing` as its first element. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
