You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        ans = ''
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves integers t, n, k, m, and a string s. It checks if the string s contains at least n unique substrings of length k. If so, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it identifies the missing character needed to form such substrings and constructs a valid output string, then prints 'NO' followed by the constructed string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes variables `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences found and `cur` to keep track of the current state of the bitmask representing the characters seen so far.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it calculates its position in the alphabet (`cur_ss`) and checks if this character has been seen before using a bitmask.
   - If the character has not been seen before, it updates the bitmask and increments the count `cnt`.
   - If all possible characters have been seen (i.e., `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`), it increments `cnt`, resets the bitmask, and appends the character to `ans`.

3. **Checking Validity:**
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that includes at least one character that is missing from the bitmask and the rest are 'a'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Bitmask Calculation:**
   - The program uses a bitmask to track which characters have been seen. However, the way the bitmask is updated and checked might not correctly reflect the presence of all possible subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Character Selection:**
   - The logic to select a character that is missing from the bitmask is flawed. The program simply picks the first missing character, which might not be the correct one to ensure all subsequences are covered.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The constructed string `ans` is not necessarily a valid subsequence of `s`. The program assumes that appending 'a' repeatedly will cover all missing subsequences, which is not always true.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the string `s` and constructs invalid subsequences when necessary.

### Correctness:
**False**
