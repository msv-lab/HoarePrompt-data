Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. This ensures that when we take the minimum of pairs, we always pick the smallest available elements first, which is optimal for maximizing the score.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The program then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, effectively pairing the smallest elements together and summing their minimum values. This is the correct approach because it ensures that the score is maximized by always combining the smallest available numbers.

4. **Output**: The program prints the computed score for each test case, which is the desired output format.

Given these points, the program logic aligns perfectly with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
