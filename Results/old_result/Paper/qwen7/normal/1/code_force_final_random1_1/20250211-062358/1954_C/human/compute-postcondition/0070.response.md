The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `len(a)` after the current iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must still be less than `len(a)`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is less than `len(a)`. This means `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.

The states that need to be adjusted are:

- The value of `i` should be such that `i < len(a) - 1`.

So, the modified state is:

State: **`new2[i+1]` is assigned the maximum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new[i+1]` is assigned the minimum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, and `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`**
