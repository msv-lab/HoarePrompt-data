Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 2
   - `n` is at least 5
   - `m` is at least 20
   - `y` is 2
   - `cnt` is 4 (this variable is not part of the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with current values**:
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`: 
     \[
     (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
     \]
   - Since `n` is at least 5, `8 <= n` is true.
   - Calculate `(x + y) * y`: 
     \[
     (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
     \]
   - Since `m` is at least 20, `8 <= m` is true.

   Therefore, the loop condition is true with the current values.

4. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` must remain true.
   - We need to ensure that either `(x + y) * x <= n` or `(x + y) * y <= m` remains true after the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` can be adjusted to maintain the loop condition.
   - Since `x` and `y` are constants (2), the only variables that can be adjusted are `n` and `m`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - To ensure the loop continues, `n` must be such that `(x + y) * x <= n` remains true.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `m` must be such that `(x + y) * y <= m` remains true.

Given the current values, the loop can continue as long as `n` is at least 8 and `m` is at least 8. However, since `n` is at least 5 and `m` is at least 20, we need to ensure these conditions are met.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is 2, `n` is at least 8, `m` is at least 8, `y` is 2**
