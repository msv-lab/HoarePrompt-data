Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is provided as input to the loop. The value of `n` will be the last input integer provided within the loop. The variable `word` will be determined based on the value of `n` in the final iteration: if `n` is greater than 52, `word` will be 'zz'; otherwise, if `n` is greater than 26, `word` will be 'az'; otherwise, `word` will be 'aaa'.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the final state of the variables will reflect the last input value of `n` and the corresponding value of `word` derived from the conditions specified in the loop body.
