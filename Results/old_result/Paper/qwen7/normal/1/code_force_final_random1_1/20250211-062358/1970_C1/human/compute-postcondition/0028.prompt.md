Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` will be less than or equal to 0; `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration; `b` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration; `rev[b]` will contain all integers `a` that were inputs along with `b` throughout the loop's iterations; `lst[a]` will contain all integers `b` that were inputs along with `a` throughout the loop's iterations; `tmp` is equal to `z`; `one` is set to True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `one` is False, `lst[z]` is not an empty list, `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `lst[tmp]`, `x` will be less than or equal to 0 after all iterations, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `b` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `rev[b]` will contain all integers `a` that were inputs along with `b` throughout the loop's iterations, `lst[a]` will contain all integers `b` that were inputs along with `a` throughout the loop's iterations.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `one` is True, `lst[z]` is not an empty list, `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `lst[tmp] - 1`, `x` will be less than or equal to 0 after all iterations, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `b` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `rev[b]` will contain all integers `a` that were inputs along with `b` throughout the loop's iterations, `lst[a]` will contain all integers `b` that were inputs along with `a` throughout the loop's iterations.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `one` is False, `lst[z]` is not an empty list, `tmp` is now equal to the second last element of `lst[tmp]`, `x` will be less than or equal to 0 after all iterations, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `b` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `rev[b]` will contain all integers `a` that were inputs along with `b` throughout the loop's iterations, `lst[a]` will contain all integers `b` that were inputs along with `a` throughout the loop's iterations.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
