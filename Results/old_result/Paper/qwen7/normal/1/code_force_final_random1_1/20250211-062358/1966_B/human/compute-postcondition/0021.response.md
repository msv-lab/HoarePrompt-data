Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` must be greater than 1
   - `impossible` remains False
   - The postcondition involves checking if the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or if the last element of the nth row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the nth row in `gr`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < m - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, so the next value of `j` will be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < m - 1`.

4. **New State:**
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `m` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
   - `impossible` remains False.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, and `impossible` remains False**
