Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in val:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the first element in `val`.
   - `c` is `i // 2`.
   - `y` is decreased by `i // 2`.
   - `sx` is `i` plus the previous value of `sx`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the second element in `val`.
   - `c` will be updated to the new `i // 2`.
   - `y` will be decreased by the new `i // 2`.
   - `sx` will be updated to the new `i` plus the previous value of `sx`.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` changes from the first element to the second element in `val`.
- `c` becomes the new `i // 2`.
- `y` is decreased by the new `i // 2`.
- `sx` is updated to the new `i` plus the previous value of `sx`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is the second element in `val`, `c` is the new `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by the new `i // 2`, `sx` is the new `i` plus the previous value of `sx`**
