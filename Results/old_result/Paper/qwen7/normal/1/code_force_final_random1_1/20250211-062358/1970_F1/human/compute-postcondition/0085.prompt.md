Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `ind` is 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is updated to the list of strings read from `stdin`, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ind` is incremented by 1, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`, and `ind` is less than `len(line)`, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, otherwise `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind)`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1, and the condition `line[ind][1] == 'G'` is checked. If true, `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind + 1]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind + 1]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind + 1)` for each non-`.` character in `line`, and `ind + 1` is less than `len(line)`, and the current value of `line[ind + 1]` is not `'..'`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is `True`, otherwise `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind + 1)`, and if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, `goal[tmp]` now includes an additional tuple `(i, ind + 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `ind` is `ind + 2`, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind + 1]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind + 1]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind + 1)` for each non-`.` character in `line`, and `ind + 2` is less than `len(line)`, and the current value of `line[ind + 1]` is not `'..'`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is now `False` and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind)` and if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, `goal[tmp]` now includes an additional tuple `(i, ind + 1)`; otherwise, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, and `tmp` is set to 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(i, ind)`, and if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, `goal[tmp]` now includes an additional tuple `(i, ind + 1)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
