Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s', `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s', and `x` is updated to the count of 'map' in `s`.**

The code updates the variable `x` to be the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. The values of `a`, `s`, and `y` remain unchanged.
