Output State: `j` is equal to `m - 2`, `impossible` remains False, `m` must be greater than 3.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j` in the range `m - 1`. After executing the loop three times, `j` has been incremented three times starting from 0, so it will be `2 + 1 = 3`, but since the loop increments `j` within its body, the final value of `j` will be `m - 2`. The condition inside the loop does not change the value of `impossible`, and as long as `m` is greater than 3 (as per the initial state), the loop will run until `j` reaches `m - 2`.
