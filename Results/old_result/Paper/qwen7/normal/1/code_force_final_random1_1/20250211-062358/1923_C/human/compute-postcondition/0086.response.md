Output State: The list `l` is exhausted after all its elements have been processed. The variable `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`. The variable `j` is the count of how many times an element with value 1 was encountered in `l`. The list `p` contains all cumulative sums of elements in `l` (starting from the first element). The list `c` contains the count of 1s encountered up to each element in `l`.

In more detail:
- `l` is now an empty list since all elements have been processed.
- `i` is the sum of all integers in the original list `l`.
- `j` is the total number of 1s in the original list `l`.
- `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
- `c` is a list where each element represents the count of 1s encountered up to that point in the iteration of `l`.
