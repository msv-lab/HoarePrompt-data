Output State: **`v` is an integer less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**.

This means that the value of `total` has been increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other conditions and constraints on the variables remain unchanged.
