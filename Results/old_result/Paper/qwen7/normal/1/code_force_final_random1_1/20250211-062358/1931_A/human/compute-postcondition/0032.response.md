Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'aaa'**.

Explanation: The variable `word` is updated by concatenating the string `'aa'` with the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 3`. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact character cannot be determined without knowing the value of `n`. However, we know that `word` will start with `'aa'` and append the third character before `n` (since `n - 3` is used). Assuming `alphabet` is a standard English alphabet list starting from 'a', the third character before `n` would be `alphabet[n-3]`, making `word` equal to `'aaa'` if `n` is 3 or greater.
