Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `v` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order. At each iteration, `v` takes the value of the current element from `b`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is the value of `p` multiplied by the last element of `b` (which is `v`) modulo `m`.
   - `ans` contains the value of `p` appended.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating in reverse, the next value of `v` will be the second-to-last element of `b`.
   - The variable `p` will be updated based on the new value of `v`.
   - The variable `ans` will contain the updated value of `p` appended.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `p` will be updated to the value of `p` multiplied by the new `v` modulo `m`.
   - `ans` will contain the updated value of `p` appended.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`p` is the value of `p` multiplied by the second-to-last element of `b` modulo `m`, `ans` contains the value of `p` appended.**
