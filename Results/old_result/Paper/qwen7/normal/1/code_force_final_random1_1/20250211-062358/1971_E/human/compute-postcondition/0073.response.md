Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(b) + len(a) - 1`
- `l` is equal to `len(a) - 1`
- `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the result of adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration from `0` to `len(a) - 1`
- `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration.

The `print()` statement without any arguments will simply print an empty line.

Output: **''**
