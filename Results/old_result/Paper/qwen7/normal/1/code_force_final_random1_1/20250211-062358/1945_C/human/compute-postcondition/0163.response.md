Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, `final` is either `[0]` or `[n]` depending on whether `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, and `t` is `t - 1`; `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `sl = list(s)` creates a new list `sl` that contains the characters of the string `s`. The values of `mini`, `final`, `t`, `pk`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
