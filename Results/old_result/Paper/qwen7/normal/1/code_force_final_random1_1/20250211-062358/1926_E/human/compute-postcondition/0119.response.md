Output State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [0, 1], `tot` is 2 + a**

Explanation: The variable `a` is initially 2, and `tot` is not explicitly defined before the code snippet. However, the condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a` is mentioned, which implies that `tot` was previously set in such a way that the condition could be evaluated. After executing `tot += a`, `tot` is updated to its previous value plus `a`, which is 2. Therefore, `tot` is now 2 + 2 = 4. The values of `a` and `L` remain unchanged.
