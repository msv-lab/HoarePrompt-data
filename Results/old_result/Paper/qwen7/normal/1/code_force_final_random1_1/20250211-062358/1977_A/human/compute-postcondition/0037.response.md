Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `m` is the second integer from the input split.**

The code `n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
