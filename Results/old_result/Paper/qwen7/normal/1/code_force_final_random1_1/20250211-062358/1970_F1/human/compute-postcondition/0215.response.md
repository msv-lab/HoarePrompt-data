Output State: **`command` is a list of strings, `command` is ('obj', 'com'), `time` is `time` + 1, `pos` is updated to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`, if `obj` is a player and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true or `obj` is not a player but `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then `player` is determined based on whether `obj` is a player or not, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, if the command is 'T' and the goalIn(pos) is not -1, then the team corresponding to the goal position has its points incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `elements[obj]` to `nxt`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their previous states. The conditions for determining `player` and incrementing team points are preserved but not directly affected by this line of code.
