Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `m`, `a` are assigned the values from `test_cases[_]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns values from `test_cases[_]` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `a`. Since the exact values in `test_cases[_]` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `a`. However, we know that `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
