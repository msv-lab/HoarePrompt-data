Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `array2` will contain all elements added during each iteration where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was satisfied.
- The sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `i`, `array2`, `arr`, `b`, `a`, or `f`. It will always print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
