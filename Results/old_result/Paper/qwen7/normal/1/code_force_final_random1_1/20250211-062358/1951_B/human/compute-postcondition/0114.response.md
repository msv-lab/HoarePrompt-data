Postcondition: `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `j` is increased by 1, `h` is compared to `i`, and `ans` is increased by 1, with `j` being increased by 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1 again, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `j` is increased by 1, `h` is compared to `i`, and `j` is increased by 1.
