Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 500, `_` takes on all integer values from 0 to t-1, `n` is an input integer for each iteration, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer for each iteration.

In this final output state, the loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, the variable `_` takes on the value of the current iteration index (ranging from 0 to t-1). The variable `n` represents the number of elements in the list `nums` for that particular iteration, and `nums` is a list of integers derived from user input. The loop processes each of the `t` inputs independently, printing the sum of the second largest number and the last number in the list `nums` for each input.
