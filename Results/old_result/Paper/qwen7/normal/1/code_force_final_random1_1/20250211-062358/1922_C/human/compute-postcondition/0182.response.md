Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is -1, and the dictionary `d2` and list `l` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `m`. It does not affect the values of `i`, `d2`, or `l`. Therefore, `i` remains `-1`, and `d2` and `l` remain unchanged from their previous states.
