Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Card Grouping**: For each test case, it calculates how many cards are laid down at each step. This is done using the loop where `m = (n + 1) // 2` and `n -= m`. This effectively counts the number of odd multiples of the current multiplier (starting from 1 and increasing by 1 each time).
3. **Finding the k-th Card**: After determining the groups, the program iterates over these groups to find which group the k-th card belongs to. It uses `tot` to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down and `pow` to keep track of the current multiplier.
4. **Output**: Once the correct group is identified, it calculates the exact card number within that group using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

The logic is sound and handles the constraints appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
