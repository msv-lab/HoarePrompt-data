Output State: **`suf` is updated such that its i-th element is now the sum of its i-th element and `l[i]`, and `suf` has an additional element which is `suf[i] + l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `suf`, which is the sum of the current `i`-th element of `suf` and the `i`-th element of `l`. The value of `i` used here is `i + 2`. Therefore, the updated `suf` includes this new element, and the precondition that `n` must be at least 1 remains valid.
