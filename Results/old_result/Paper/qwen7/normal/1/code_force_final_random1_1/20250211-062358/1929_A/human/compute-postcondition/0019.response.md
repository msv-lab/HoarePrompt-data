Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list. The function prints this difference for each test case. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value.**
