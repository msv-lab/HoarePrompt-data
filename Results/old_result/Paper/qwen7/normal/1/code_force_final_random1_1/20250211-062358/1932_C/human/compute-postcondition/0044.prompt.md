You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4], and s is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length n.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `b` will be a list containing exactly `n` elements. Each element in `b` will either be `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. If the character in `s` at index `i` is 'L', then `b[i]` will be `a[l]` and `l` will be incremented. If the character in `s` at index `i` is 'R', then `b[i]` will be `a[r]` and `r` will be decremented. The final values of `l` and `r` will be such that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and both will be within their valid ranges as defined initially.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `p` is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`; `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `p` computed during each iteration of the loop in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list `ans` which contains all intermediate values of `p` computed during each iteration of the loop in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4]), and `s` (a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`). It returns a reversed list `ans` which contains all intermediate values of `p` computed during each iteration of the loop in reverse order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a reversed list `ans` which contains all intermediate values of `p` computed during each iteration of the loop in reverse order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
