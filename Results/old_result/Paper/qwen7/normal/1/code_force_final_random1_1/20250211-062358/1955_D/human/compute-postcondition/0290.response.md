Output State: **`i` is 1, `n - m` must be at least 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 0 previously, now `i` is 1. If `i` was 1 previously, now `i` is 2.
- The condition `n - m` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop itself.
- The variable `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, where `a[i]` is `a[1]` if `i` was 0 previously, or `a[2]` if `i` was 1 previously.
