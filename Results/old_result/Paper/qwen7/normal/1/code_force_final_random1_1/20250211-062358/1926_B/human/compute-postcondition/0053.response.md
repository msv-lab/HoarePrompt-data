Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used for iterating over the range.
   - `int(input())`: This is the expression that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state adjustments needed**:
   - The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder, no adjustments are needed for this variable.
   - The value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop will run. Therefore, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a positive integer (since the loop should execute at least once if there is input).

3. **Adjust the state of `a` and `k`**:
   - The state of `a` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop condition.
   - The state of `k` is an empty list, and since the loop does not modify `k` directly, its state remains unchanged.

4. **Final state adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` results in a positive integer. If the input is a non-positive integer, the loop will not execute.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input to `int(input())` such that it returns a positive integer.

**State:**
**`i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `a`, `k` is an empty list, input must return a positive integer**
