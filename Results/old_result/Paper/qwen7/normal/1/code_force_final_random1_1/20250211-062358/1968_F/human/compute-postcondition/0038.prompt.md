Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 6, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is 7, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros except `a[1]` which is equal to `int(data[6])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[3]` is either `pf[2] ^ a[3]` added to `mp` with an empty list as its value, or `pf[3]` remains unchanged, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 3, `mp[pf[i]]` is appended with `i` (which is 3).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `idx` is 8, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros except `a[1]` which is equal to `int(data[6])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[4]` is equal to `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 4, `a[4]` is `int(data[idx])`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `idx` is 9, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros except `a[1]` which is equal to `int(data[6])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[4]` is equal to `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 6, `a[6]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[6]` is equal to `pf[5] ^ a[6]`, and `mp[pf[6]]` is a list containing the value 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
