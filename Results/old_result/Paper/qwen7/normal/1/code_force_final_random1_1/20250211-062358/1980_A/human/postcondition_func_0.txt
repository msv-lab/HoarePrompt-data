The function calculates and returns a list of integers. Each integer represents the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. For each test case, it processes a string of problem difficulties and determines how many more problems are required to meet the specified number of upcoming rounds (`m`). The calculation involves counting the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') across all problems in the test cases, then determining the shortfall between the required number of problems (`m`) and the current count (`f`) for each difficulty level. The function sums these shortfalls to produce the result for each test case.
