Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `curr` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. Since the else part is not provided, the postcondition remains as per the if part, meaning `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0`.**
