Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_3()`**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2()` to process the array, and prints the result. The logic here seems to be correctly structured to read input, process it, and output the required results.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum()` to process the array and returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves. The structure and purpose of this function align well with the problem requirements.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum()`**: This function aims to maximize the sum of any subarray by setting all elements in a subarray to its length if the sum is less than or equal to the square of its length. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element and recursively processes the subarrays before and after this maximum element. This approach ensures that the sum is maximized by setting the subarray to the highest possible value without exceeding the allowed operations.

4. **Function `func_1()`**: This function is used to update the array and record operations. It recursively ensures that the subarray is set to the appropriate value and records the operations. The function correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and updates the array accordingly.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, each function performs the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array while adhering to the constraints. The overall structure and logic of the program are consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
