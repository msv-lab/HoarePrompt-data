Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, x is a list of length n with all elements set to None, y is a list of length n with all elements set to None, r is a list of n elements, each set to None, visited is a list of n boolean values indicating whether a disk has been visited during the DFS, and coef is a list of n floating-point numbers used to calculate the coefficients for the disks' tangency conditions.**

The code `r = [None] * n` initializes the list `r` with `n` elements, each set to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
