Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
- `final` contains the element `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`.
- `lst` must contain at least one element.

### Loop Head:
```
for elem in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `elem` in `lst`.
- The loop variable `elem` is used within the loop body to compute `abs(pk - elem)` and update `mini` and `final`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the Loop Variable**: The loop variable `elem` changes with each iteration.
2. **Update `mini` and `final`**: During each iteration, `mini` and `final` may be updated based on the current `elem`.
3. **Check `lst`**: Ensure `lst` still contains at least one element.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- Since the loop is about to execute another iteration, `lst` must still contain at least one element.
- `mini` and `final` will be updated based on the new `elem` in this iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `mini` will be updated to the smallest value among `abs(pk - elem)` for the remaining elements in `lst`.
- `final` will be updated to the element `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals the new `mini`.
- `lst` must still contain at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, `final` contains the element `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, and `lst` must contain at least one element.**
