Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `elem`: This variable is used to iterate over each element in the list `lst`.
   
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `final` is an empty list.
   - `mini` is a variable that will be updated based on the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `lst`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `lst`, the list `lst` itself must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `mini` will be initialized before the loop starts (assuming it has some initial value), and it will be updated during each iteration of the loop.

Given this information, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `lst` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `mini` will be initialized before the loop starts, but its exact initial value is not specified in the problem statement. We can assume it is initialized to some value (e.g., `float('inf')` if it is meant to find the minimum difference).

Therefore, the state after adjustment should include:
- `lst` must have at least one element.
- `mini` is initialized to some value (we can assume it is initialized to a value that ensures the loop can start, such as `float('inf')`).

**State:**
**`final` is an empty list, `lst` must have at least one element, mini is initialized to some value (e.g., float('inf'))**
