Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input split.
   - `m` is the second integer from the input split.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition `i in range(t)` means the loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged as per the problem statement.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged as specified.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `m` is the second integer from the input split**.
