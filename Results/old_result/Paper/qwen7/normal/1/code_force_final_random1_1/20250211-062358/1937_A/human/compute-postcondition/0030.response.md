Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `n` is 3 if `n_cases` is greater than 8, otherwise `n` is 1, and `power` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `n = log2(n)` updates the value of `n`. Given the initial conditions, if `n_cases` is greater than 8, then `n` is set to `log2(n_cases)`, which is 3 since \(2^3 = 8\) and the next integer power of 2 is 16. If `n_cases` is not greater than 8, then `n` remains 1. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `power`) remain unchanged.
