Output State: The list `a` will be transformed such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will hold the sum of the first `i` elements from the list `x`. Specifically, `a[i]` will be equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.

For example, if `x = [10, 20, 30, 40]` and `n = 5`, then after the loop completes, `a` will be `[1000, 110, 130, 160, 200]`. Here's how it breaks down:
- `a[1] = 1000 + x[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1010 + 20 = 1030`
- `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 1030 + 30 = 1060`
- `a[4] = a[3] + x[3] = 1060 + 40 = 1100`

So, the final state of `a` will be a list where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `x`, starting from `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`.
