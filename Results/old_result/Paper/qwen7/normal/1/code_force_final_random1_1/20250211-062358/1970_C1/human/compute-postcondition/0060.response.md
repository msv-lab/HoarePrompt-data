Output State: **`tree[current]` is not empty (excluding the previously processed `neighbor`), `visited` includes the previously processed `neighbor` and the new `neighbor`, `queue` includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and also has the newly appended tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.

This means that the `queue` now contains the previously existing elements along with the newly appended tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
