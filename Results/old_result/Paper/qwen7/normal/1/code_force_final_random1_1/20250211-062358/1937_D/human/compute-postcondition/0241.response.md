Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, and either `r` is 0 with `a` being the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)` and `b` not defined, or `a` is not defined and `b` is the value of `B[r - 1] - B[r - l - 1] - (idx_B[r - l - 1] - 2) * (r - l - 1)`, or `a` is equal to `B[r]` and `b` is updated based on whether `l - r - 1` is greater than 0 or not: if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, otherwise `b` is `b + A[l - 1]`.
