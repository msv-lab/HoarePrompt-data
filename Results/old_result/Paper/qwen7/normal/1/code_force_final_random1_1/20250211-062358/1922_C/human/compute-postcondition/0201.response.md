Output State: `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. The values of `x` and `y` are determined by user input during each iteration of the loop. If `y` is greater than `x` in any iteration, the program prints `d1[y] - d1[x]`; otherwise, it prints `d2[y] - d2[x]`. After all iterations, no further changes are made to `m` and `j`, and the values of `x` and `y` reflect the last inputs provided by the user.
