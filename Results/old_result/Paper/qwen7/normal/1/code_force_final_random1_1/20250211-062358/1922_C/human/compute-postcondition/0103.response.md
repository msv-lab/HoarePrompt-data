Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `n - 2` to `0` in steps of `-1`.
   - Therefore, the loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `1` (since the loop starts at `n - 2` and decrements by `1`).

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than `1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 3`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be `n - 3`.
   - `d2[n - 1]` remains `1` because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `d2[i]` will be updated based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` for the new value of `i`.

5. **Postconditions for the New State:**
   - `d1[n + 1]` will be updated based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` for `i` ranging from `1` to `n - 3`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `d2[n - 1]` is `1`, `d2[i]` is either `2` or updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` for each `i` from `n - 3` down to `0`, depending on whether the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` holds. `d1[n + 1]` is the sum of `d1[2]` (which is `1`) and the number of times the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true for `i` ranging from `1` to `n - 3`, plus the cumulative differences `l[i + 1] - l[i]` when the condition does not hold.**
