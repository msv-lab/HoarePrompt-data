Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `s` is initially defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- `a` and `b` are then updated to new input integers
- `s` is updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `i`, `m`, `a`, `b`, or `s`, and it only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
