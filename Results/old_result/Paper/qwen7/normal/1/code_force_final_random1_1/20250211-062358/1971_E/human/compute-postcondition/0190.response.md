To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression for `m`.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `m` is defined as `m + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`.
   - `q` is equal to `len(a)`.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into the list `a` to keep it sorted.
   - `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `m` is being updated based on the formula involving `bd[s]`, `ql`, `a[s - 1]`, and `ad[s]`.
   - `q` is simply the length of the list `a`.
   - `s` is determined by the insertion point of `ql` into `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - `ql` is modified by subtracting `a[s - 1]`.

3. **Expression for `m`:**
   - The exact value of `m` depends on the specific values of `bd[s]`, `ql`, `a[s - 1]`, and `ad[s]`.
   - Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe `m` in terms of these variables.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(int(m), end=' ')`.
   - This will convert `m` to an integer and print it without a newline.

Given the above analysis, the output will be the integer value of `m` as calculated by the formula, followed by a space.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as m + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]))**
