Output State: **`pk` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, `final` is an empty list, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `o * 100 // n` to the variable `c1`. Since the initial values of `o` and `n` are not specified, `c1` is calculated based on these values. The other variables (`pk`, `mini`, and `final`) remain unchanged.
