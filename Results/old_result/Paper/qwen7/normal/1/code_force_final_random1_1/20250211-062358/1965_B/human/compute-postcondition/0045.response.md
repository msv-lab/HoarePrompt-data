Functionality: **The function processes two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n) obtained from `func_7()`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. It then appends additional values to `ans` based on the value of `k` and finally returns a string that starts with the length of `ans`, followed by a newline character, and then all values from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\) separated by spaces.**
