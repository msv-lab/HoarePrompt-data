Output State: **`ii` is 1, `i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. The values of the other variables (`ii`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
