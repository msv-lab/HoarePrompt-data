To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of `a`. This means `i` is the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`. This means `new` contains the minimum of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`.
   - `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`. This means `new2` contains the maximum of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
   ```
   This line of code joins the elements of `new2` into a single string, converting each element to a string if necessary, and then prints the resulting string.

Given this breakdown, the output will be a string formed by concatenating the elements of `new2`, with each element converted to a string.

Output: **a string formed by concatenating the maximum of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`**
