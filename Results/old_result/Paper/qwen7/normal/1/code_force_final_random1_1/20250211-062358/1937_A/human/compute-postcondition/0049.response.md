The code reads an integer input for `n`. Based on the initial state, `n` can either be 1 or greater than 8, depending on the value of `n_cases`. If `n` is 1, then `i` remains 1 and `power` is 4. Otherwise, `i` becomes 2, `n` is greater than 8, and `power` is 8. After reading the input for `n`, the value of `n` will be updated to the input value, and the other variables will retain their conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 1 if `n` is 1, otherwise `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `n` is 1 if `n_cases` must be 1, otherwise `n` is greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\), and `power` is 4 if `n` is 1, otherwise `power` is 8.**
