Output State: **`n` is -1; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba.append(n)` appends the current value of `n` (which is -1) to the list `path_ba`. Since `path_ba` initially contains `[b]`, after appending `-1`, it becomes `[b, -1]`. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them in the given code snippet.
