Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case as required.
- It checks if the string `s` contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO', which is correct because rearranging such a string would result in the same string.
- For other cases, it prints 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically sorted version or the reverse-sorted version of the unique characters in `s`. This ensures that the resulting string `r` is different from `s`.
- The logic for determining whether to print the lexicographically sorted or reverse-sorted version is also correct, ensuring that `r` is different from `s` when possible.
- The program does not modify the state of `t` beyond decrementing `n` in each iteration, which is correct as `t` should remain unchanged.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
