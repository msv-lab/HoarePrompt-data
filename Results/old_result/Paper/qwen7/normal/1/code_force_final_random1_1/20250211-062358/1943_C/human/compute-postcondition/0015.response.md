Output State: **`u2vs[u]` is a list containing `v` and the original value of `v`, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing both `u` and the original value of `u`, `n` is 1, `u` is an integer which is 1 less than the original input integer `u`, `v` is the integer input after decrementing by 1, and the input was split into integers and assigned to `u` and `v`.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `u` and `v`. Since `u` is 1 less than the original input integer, and `v` is the integer input after decrementing by 1, the values of `u` and `v` are updated based on the user's input. The rest of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
