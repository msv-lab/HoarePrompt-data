Output State: **The final state of the loop will be as follows: `i` equals `n-2`, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n-1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n-2) - 1)` which simplifies to `(o - one) * 100 // 1` or simply `o - one` since `n - (n-2) - 1` equals 1, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` was met during the loop iterations.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n-2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`. The variable `zero` will hold the total count of '0's in the list `s`, and `one` will hold the total count of '1's in `s`. The percentage calculations `zero_perc` and `one_perc` will be based on the final counts of zeros and ones in the list relative to the length of the list. The list `lst` will contain all the indices `i + 1` where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were satisfied during the loop's execution.
