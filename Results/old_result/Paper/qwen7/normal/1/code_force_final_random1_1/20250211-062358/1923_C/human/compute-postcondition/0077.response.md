Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of `l`, `i` is the second element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1 if the second element of `l` is 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j`.**

Explanation: The code `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`, which is the second element of the list `l`. Additionally, if the second element of `l` is 1, then `j` is increased by 1. The lists `p` and `c` are updated to contain the new value of `i` and the new value of `j`, respectively. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
