Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer before the code execution.
