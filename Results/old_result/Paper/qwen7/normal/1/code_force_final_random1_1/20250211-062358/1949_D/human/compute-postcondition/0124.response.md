Output State: **`i` is 6; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24; `j` is not equal to `n + 1`; `sa` is a list containing the integer 6.**

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 6) to the list `sa`. Since `i` was already an integer, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `j`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, they retain their initial conditions.
