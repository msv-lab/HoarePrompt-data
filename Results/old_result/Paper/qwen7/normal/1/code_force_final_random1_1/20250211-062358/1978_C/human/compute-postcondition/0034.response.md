Output State: **The loop will continue to decrement `i` by 2 until `i` is no longer less than or equal to 0. At that point, the function `func_2(c, k, l)` will be returned.**

To break it down:
- The loop starts with `i` equal to `n`.
- In each iteration, `i` decreases by 2.
- `c` increases by 1 for each iteration.
- `k` is updated as `k -= i + 1`.
- `l` is updated to the return value of `func_3(c, l)` after each iteration.

The loop continues until `i` becomes less than 0. At that point, since `i` is no longer within the range specified in the loop condition (`range(n, -1, -2)`), the loop terminates.

Since `n` is initially an integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\), and `i` starts at `n` and decreases by 2 in each iteration, the loop will terminate when `i` is less than 0. This means the loop will run \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\) times, where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

After the loop completes, the final values will be:
- `i` will be less than 0.
- `c` will be \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\).
- `k` will be updated according to the formula `k -= i + 1` for each iteration.
- `l` will be the result of calling `func_3(c, l)` multiple times, ultimately being the last value returned by `func_3`.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is determined by the conditions described above.
