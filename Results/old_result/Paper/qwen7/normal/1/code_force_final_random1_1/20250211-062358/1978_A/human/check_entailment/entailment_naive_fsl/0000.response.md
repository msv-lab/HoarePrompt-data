Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always includes the last element in both piles, which is incorrect according to the problem description. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
4
2 3 3 1
```

The expected output should be 4 (by putting books 2 and 3 in one pile and books 1 and 4 in another), but the program incorrectly outputs 5 because it always includes the last element in both piles.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the last element is only included in one of the piles, and the rest of the elements are divided between the two piles to maximize the sum of the highest books in each pile.
