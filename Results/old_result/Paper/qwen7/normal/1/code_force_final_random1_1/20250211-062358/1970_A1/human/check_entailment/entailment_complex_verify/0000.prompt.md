You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance attribute of infoA and the balance attribute of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where both `balance` attributes are equal, and both `position` attributes represent the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and infoA, which represents the difference in positions of characters in two balanced parentheses sequences.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects containing `balance` and `position` attributes. It returns the difference between the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` if their `balance` values are not equal. If the `balance` values are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` attributes of `infoB` and `infoA`. This difference in `position` represents the difference in positions of characters in two balanced parentheses sequences.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains the original length of the string `s`, and `balance` is the net balance of the parentheses in the string `s` (i.e., the difference between the number of '(' and ')'). The `balance_info` list contains `n` elements, each being a `BalanceInfo` object where the `balance` attribute reflects the balance at each step `i` during the loop, and `i` is the index at which the balance was recorded. If `s[i]` is '(', the `balance` attribute increases by 1, and if `s[i]` is ')', the `balance` attribute decreases by 1.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the concatenation of the `character` attributes of each `BalanceInfo` object in the `balance_info` list, sorted by the `balance` attribute in ascending order and by the negative of the `position` attribute in descending order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", calculates the balance of parentheses at each position, sorts the positions based on their balance and index, and prints the characters at these positions in the sorted order. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the sorting of the `balance_info` list properly. The sorting key should ensure that the balance is sorted in ascending order and in case of a tie, the positions are sorted in descending order. However, the current implementation sorts the positions in ascending order instead of descending order.

Here is an example to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
(()(()))
```

Expected output:
```
()(()())
```

However, due to the incorrect sorting key, the program might produce an incorrect output. For instance, the sorting key should be:
```python
balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
```

But the current implementation uses:
```python
balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
```

This results in the positions being sorted in ascending order instead of descending order, leading to an incorrect shuffle.

To fix this, the sorting key should be:
```python
balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
```

By correcting the sorting key, the program will correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation.
