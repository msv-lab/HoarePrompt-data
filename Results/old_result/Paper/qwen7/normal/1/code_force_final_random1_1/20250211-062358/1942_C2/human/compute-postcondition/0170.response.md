Output State: **`i` is the second element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `sx` is the new value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`, and `y` is now `y - (i // 2)`**.

This means that the value of `y` has been updated to `y - (i // 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
