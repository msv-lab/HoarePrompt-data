Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. The values of `a`, `b_values`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
