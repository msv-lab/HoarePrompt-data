Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros except for indices in `b` which are incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `b_values` is a set containing unique values from the list `b`.**

Explanation: The line `b_values = set(b)` creates a set from the list `b`, which contains only unique values from `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`, `b`, `i`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial or pre-loop states. The new variable `b_values` is created and contains the unique elements from the list `b`.
