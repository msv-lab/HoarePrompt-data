Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `k` is an integer input from the user.
- `t` is decremented by 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is `print(k // 2 + 1)`. 

Here, `k` is an integer input from the user. The expression `k // 2 + 1` means `k` is divided by 2 using integer division (which truncates the decimal part), and then 1 is added to the result.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `k` divided by 2 (integer division), plus 1.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the integer input from the user)**
