Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` now contains the elements `a` appended to it, `lst[a]` now contains the element `b` appended to its previous content, `a` is updated to a new integer value from input, `b` is updated to a new integer value from input, `rev[b]` contains `a` appended to the previous list of `rev[b]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `rev[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `a` and `b`, which are updated to new integer values from input. Therefore, `rev[b]` now includes the newly appended value of `a`.
