Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is calculated as ((`o` - 2) * 100) // (`n` - 1 - 1)**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. Given that `one` is 2, `i` is 1, and assuming `o` is `zero` which is 1, the calculation becomes `((1 - 2) * 100) // (n - 1 - 1)`, which simplifies to `-100 // (n - 2)`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the exact value of `one_perc` depends on the value of `n`, but it is calculated as described. All other variables remain unchanged.
