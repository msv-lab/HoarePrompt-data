The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `a`.

State: **`new2[i+1]` is assigned the maximum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new[i+1]` is assigned the minimum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, and `i` must be less than the length of `a`**
