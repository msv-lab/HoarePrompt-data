You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a specified number of test cases, where for each test case, it takes two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) as inputs. It calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner based on these inputs and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case. The final state of the program is that the variable `t` is set to 0, indicating all test cases have been processed, and the `results` list contains the outcomes of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them as is.
   - After each move, one coin is removed from the player's current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game essentially reduces the total number of coins by 1 in each complete round (one move by Alice and one by Bob).
   - The player who faces the situation where the total number of coins is 1 will lose because they cannot make a valid move without having 0 coins in their wallet.

3. **Analyzing the Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, there will be an odd number of moves until the total number of coins becomes 1.
   - Since Alice starts first, she will face the situation where the total number of coins is 1 on her turn, making her lose.
   - Conversely, if the sum is odd, there will be an even number of moves until the total number of coins becomes 1, and Bob will face the situation where the total number of coins is 1 on his turn, making him lose.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.

6. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It correctly prints the winner for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the sum of the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- The implementation of reading test cases and processing them is also correct.

**Final Answer: Correctness: **True**
