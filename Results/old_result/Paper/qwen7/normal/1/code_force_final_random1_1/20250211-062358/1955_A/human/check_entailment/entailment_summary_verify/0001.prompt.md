You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs based on the values of \(A\) and \(B\) relative to \(C\):
- If \(2B < C\), it prints \(A \times B\).
- If \(2B \geq C\) and \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
- If \(2B \geq C\) and \(A\) is odd, it prints \(\left\lfloor \frac{A}{2} \right\rfloor \times C + B\).

After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated outputs for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` in the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`2*a`).
     - If `2*a > b`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.
     - If `2*a <= b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` (number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the total cost by dividing `A` by 2 and multiplying by `C` (promotion price for two yogurts).

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost by:
     - Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible (using `X = A // 2`), which costs `X * C`.
     - Buying the remaining one yogurt at the individual price (`B`).

### Test Cases Analysis:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation: 
     - `2 * 5 = 10` (individual price for 2 yogurts)
     - `9` (promotion price for 2 yogurts)
     - Since `9 < 10`, the minimum cost is `9`.
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `3 * 5 = 15` (individual price for 3 yogurts)
     - `9 * 1 + 9 = 18` (buy 1 pair at promotion and 1 individually)
     - `9 * 2 + 5 = 23` (buy 2 pairs at promotion and 1 individually)
     - The minimum cost is `15`.
   - Output: `14` (Incorrect, should be `15`)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `3 * 5 = 15` (individual price for 3 yogurts)
     - `11 * 1 + 11 = 22` (buy 1 pair at promotion and 1 individually)
     - `11 * 2 + 5 = 27` (buy 2 pairs at promotion and 1 individually)
     - The minimum cost is `15`.
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `4 * 5 = 20` (individual price for 4 yogurts)
     - `11 * 2 = 22` (buy 2 pairs at promotion)
     - The minimum cost is `20`.
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd correctly. It incorrectly calculates the cost for odd numbers of yogurts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
