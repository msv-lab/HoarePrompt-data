Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with an external entity to determine the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) through a series of queries. The interaction involves asking questions in the form of four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and receiving a comparison result based on bitwise OR operations. The goal is to find indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within 3n queries.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `best` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than `n-2`, `k` is `1`, `res` is an input string.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Given that the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will end up being `n-1`. Since `best` is incremented by 1 each time `res` is '<' (which it always is according to the given outputs), after `n-1` iterations, `best` will be `n-1`. The variable `k` remains `n-1` initially and is not altered within the loop, so it stays as `1` (since `n-1` would make `k` equal to `n-1`, but the loop logic does not change `k`). The conditions on `n` and `res` remain as stated in the initial conditions and are not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `best` is `n-1`, `i` is `1`, `k` is `n-1`, and `res` is an input string.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` starts from `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `1`. Therefore, after `n-2` iterations, `i` will become `1`. The condition inside the loop checks if `res` is `<` and updates `best` to `i` if true. Given that the output state after the first three iterations shows `best` being updated to `i` when `res` is `<`, and assuming `res` is always `<` (as per the given states), `best` will be updated to `n-1` after `n-2` iterations, and `i` will be `1` at the end of the loop. The value of `k` remains `n-1` as it is not modified within the loop, and `res` remains an input string as it is not reassigned within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `best` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `i` is `n`, `k` is `n-1`, and `n` is the input integer provided by the user.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After each iteration, the value of `best` is updated to the current value of `i` if `res` is `<`. Since the loop runs `n-1` times (from 1 to `n-1`), `best` will eventually be set to `n-1` if `res` is always `<`. The value of `i` becomes `n` after the last iteration, and `k` remains `n-1` throughout the loop. The value of `res` is the input received during the last iteration of the loop, which could be either `<` or any other string. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer provided by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
