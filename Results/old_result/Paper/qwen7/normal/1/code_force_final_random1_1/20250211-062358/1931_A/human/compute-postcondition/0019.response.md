Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'zz'**.

Explanation: The code `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` appends the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz' to the string `word`. Since the initial value of `word` is an empty string, after executing this line, `word` becomes 'zz'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
