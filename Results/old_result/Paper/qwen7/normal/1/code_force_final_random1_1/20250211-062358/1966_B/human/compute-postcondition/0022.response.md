Output State: **`impossible` is False, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code `impossible = False` sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. Additionally, the initial state mentioned that `j` will be incremented to 1, so `j` is now 1. The condition that `m` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1 is still valid. The state of `impossible` being `False` is also maintained.
