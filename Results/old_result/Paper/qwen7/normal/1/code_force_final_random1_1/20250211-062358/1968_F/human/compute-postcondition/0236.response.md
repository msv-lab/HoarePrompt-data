Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` now either contains 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l` being satisfied in the if part, or if these conditions are not met, `results` contains 'NO', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that the variable `x` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
