Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, then `b` remains unchanged as the value of `A[l - 1]`.
