Given the initial state:
- `t` is 800003
- `n` is an input integer

The code snippet is:
```python
print(pd[n])
```

Here, `pd` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since it is not a predefined constant or variable with an explicit value, we cannot determine its exact content. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of what it would be if `pd` were defined appropriately.

The output would depend on the value of `n` and the structure of `pd`. If `pd` were a dictionary or a list, then `pd[n]` would refer to the nth element of `pd` or the value associated with the key `n`.

However, without more information about `pd`, we can only state that the output will be the value of `pd[n]`.

Output: **pd[n]**
