Postcondition: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if `x % i == 0` and the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is true; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1 and still within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.**
