Postcondition: `i`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` are integers. If `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`. If the condition `x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0` is not met, the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
