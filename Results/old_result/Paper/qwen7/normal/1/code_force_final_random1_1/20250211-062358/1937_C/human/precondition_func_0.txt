None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with an external entity to determine the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) through a series of queries. The interaction involves asking questions in the form of four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and receiving a comparison result based on bitwise OR operations. The goal is to find indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within 3n queries.
