Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `t` will be the last integer from the input, `v` will be the last integer from the input, `num` will be a list containing all integers `v` from each iteration where `t` was 3, `start` will be the minimum value of all `v` where `t` was 1, and `end` will be the maximum value of all `v` where `t` was 2.

In more detail, the loop will have iterated `n` times, with each iteration processing one line of input. The variable `i` will count up to `n-1`. The variables `t` and `v` will hold the values from the current line of input. If `t` is 1, `start` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `v`. If `t` is 2, `end` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and `v`. If `t` is 3, `v` will be appended to the list `num`.
