Output State: **`i` is 1; `b` must have at least 2 elements; `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the element at index `i` (which is `b[1]`) and the element at index `i-1` (which is `b[0]`) to the list `bd`. Since `i` is 1, `bd.append(b[1] - b[0])` is executed, and `bd` now contains the value `b[1] - b[0]`. The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged except for the new element added to `bd`.
