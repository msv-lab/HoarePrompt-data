Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the first three integers entered by the user. The other variables (`t`, `max_val`, and `cnt_b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
