Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    8
    
    3 4
    
    4 5
    
    7 0
    
    1 1000000000000
    
    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

Output

    Yes
    3 1 2
    No
    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    No
    Yes
    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Annotated Program:

    #State: The loop will continue to decrement `i` by 2 until `i` is no longer less than or equal to 0. At that point, the function `func_2(c, k, l)` will be returned.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= c < len(l), k is an integer such that 0 <= k < len(l), and l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.
def func_2(c, k, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[-c - k]
    l[-c], l[-c - k] = y, x

    #The program returns the list `l` which is a permutation of length n.

    #The program returns n, which is an integer between 1 and 200000, and k, which is an integer between 0 and 1000000000000.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers where each integer represents a position in the permutation of length n such that 1 <= l[i] <= n and all positions are distinct.
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `l` must contain at least one element.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `l`. Since the question does not specify any condition that would cause the loop to terminate (such as modifying `l` within the loop to remove elements or setting a break condition), the loop will keep running until `l` is empty. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is that `l` must contain at least one element, which in this case would mean `l` is empty. However, based on the given information and the format required, we can only state that `l` must contain at least one element before the loop starts, which remains true even after all iterations.
    print()
    #This is printed: ()
    return
    #The program returns a list `l` that must contain at least one element.

        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns k, which is an integer between 0 and 10^12
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12, they are the results of `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
