Output State: **`ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b` in the range from `n - m` to `n - 1`; `i` is `n - 1`; for each `i` in the range from `n - m` to `n - 1`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `b_values`, `i`, or the dictionary `cnt_b`. Therefore, these values remain as they were in the initial state.
