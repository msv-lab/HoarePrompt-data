Output State: **`nx` is either 'SF' or 'FF', `j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 1) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'**.

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with 'F', making it either 'SF' if it was originally 'S', or 'FF' if it was originally 'F'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition about the character in the list `xx[i]` at position `j-1` also remains valid.
