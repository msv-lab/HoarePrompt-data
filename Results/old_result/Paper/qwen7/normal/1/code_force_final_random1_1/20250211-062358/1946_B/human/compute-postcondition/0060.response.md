Output State: **`sm` is now equal to 2 + `suf[n]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to its value modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Since `sm` was initially equal to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) and is required to be non-negative, the new value of `sm` is the remainder when \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This ensures that `sm` remains within the range of a standard 32-bit or 64-bit integer and satisfies the condition of being non-negative.
