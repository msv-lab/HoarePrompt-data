Output State: **`countmins` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 3)`**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which was initially 2. After executing `g -= countmins`, `g` becomes `g - 2`. Given that `g` was previously `int(n / 2) - 1` and now is `int(n / 3)`, we don't need to recalculate `g` since the assignment to `g` has already been made. All other variables remain unchanged.
