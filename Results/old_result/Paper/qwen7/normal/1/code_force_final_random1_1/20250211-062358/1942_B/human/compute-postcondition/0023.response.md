Output State: **`mex` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is calculated as `n - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `i` is `-1`.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to `ar`. The other variables (`mex`, `t`, `n`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
