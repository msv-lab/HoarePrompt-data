Output State: **`total` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n)`, `ans` is `2n + 2`**

Explanation: The code `countmins = int(count - 1)` updates the value of `countmins` to be `count - 1`. Given that `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
