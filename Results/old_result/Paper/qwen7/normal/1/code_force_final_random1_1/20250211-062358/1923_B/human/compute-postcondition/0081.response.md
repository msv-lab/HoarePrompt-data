Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta - delta) - delta, `distance` remains unchanged, `pos` is one more than its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1. The values of `rest`, `distance`, and the original value of `pos` are unchanged. Therefore, `rest` retains its original formula, `distance` remains the same, and `pos` is now one more than its original value.
