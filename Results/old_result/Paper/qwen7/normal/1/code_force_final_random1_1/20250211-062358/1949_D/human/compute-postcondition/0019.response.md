Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is at least 2
   - `j` is 1
   - If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'F', then `a[j]` is increased by 1.
   - If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the state remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the loop will execute again as long as `j < n`. Given that `n` is at least 2, `j` (which is 1) is indeed less than `n`.
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2.
   - The conditions for updating `a[j]` and `b[j]` depend on the value of `x[j-1]`, but since these conditions do not affect the loop continuation, they do not need to be explicitly stated in the state update.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains 1 (unchanged).
   - `n` remains at least 2 (unchanged).
   - `j` becomes 2.
   - The conditions for updating `a[j]` and `b[j]` remain the same, but since the loop will continue based on the updated `j`, these conditions will be evaluated in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
