Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the array `x`, `a[i]` is the total count of 'F' in `x` up to index `n`, `b[j]` is the total count of 'S' in `x` up to index `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `n` remains the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `xx.append(x)` appends the array `x` to the list `xx`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The counts of 'F' and 'S' in `x` remain the same as they were after the loop completed, and `j` is set to `n + 1` as described in the initial state.
