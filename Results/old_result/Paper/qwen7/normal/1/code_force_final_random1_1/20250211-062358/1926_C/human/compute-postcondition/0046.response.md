Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of `pd[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
