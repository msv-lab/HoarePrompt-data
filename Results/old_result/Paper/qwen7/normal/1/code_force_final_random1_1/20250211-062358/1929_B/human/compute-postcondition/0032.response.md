Postcondition: **`s` is the next line from the input, `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, and the variables `n` and `k` have swapped their roles in terms of holding the split values of `s`. If `k == 4 * n - 3`, then `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, and the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped. If `k == 4 * n - 2`, the same condition holds. Otherwise, the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped.**
