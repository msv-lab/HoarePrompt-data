Output State: **`j` is 1, `l` must be a positive integer, `ans` now contains two elements where the second element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is initially 1, the expression `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j])` evaluates to the count of `rev_array[1]` in the slice `rev_array[1:]`. This value is then used to index into `alp` and append the corresponding element to `ans`. Since `ans` originally contained one element, after appending, it now contains two elements, with the second element being the newly appended value.
