Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `pk` is `n / 2`, `s` is a string input by the user, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `zero` and `one`, both set to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `pk`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, and `z`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
