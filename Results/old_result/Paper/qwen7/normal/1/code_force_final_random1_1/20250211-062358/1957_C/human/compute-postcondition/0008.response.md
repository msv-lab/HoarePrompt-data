Output State: `dp` is a list where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[4]` is 11, `dp[5]` is 29, `dp[6]` is 17, `dp[7]` is 89, `dp[8]` is 239, `dp[9]` is 719, `dp[10]` is 2081, and so on up to `dp[n]` for any given `n` up to \(3 \times 10^5\). The value of `n` is at least 10 since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n+1`. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), and `i` is `n+1`.

This output state represents the final values of the `dp` array after the loop has completed all its iterations, with each element calculated according to the given formula and modulo \(1000000007\). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) remain as initially specified or updated within the loop's constraints.
