Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `lst` contains the value 2, `one` is 1**

Explanation: The code `one += 1` increments the value of `one` by 1. Initially, `one` was not specified, but since no specific initial value was given and it's not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it started as 0 (as it's common for counters to start from 0). After the increment, `one` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
