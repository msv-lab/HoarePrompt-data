Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, x is a list of length n with all elements set to None, y is a list of length n with all elements set to None, r is a list of n elements, each set to None, visited is a list of n boolean values, all set to False, and coef is a list of n floating-point numbers, all set to None.**

Explanation: The line `coef = [None] * n` initializes the list `coef` with `n` elements, all set to `None`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so they remain unchanged.
