Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, `a` is a list of three integers converted from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
