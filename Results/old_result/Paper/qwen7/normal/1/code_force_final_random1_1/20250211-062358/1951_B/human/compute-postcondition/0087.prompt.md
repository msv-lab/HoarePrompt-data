Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s` that satisfies the condition `h < i` or the last element of `s` if no such element exists, `ans` is 1 if `h` is greater than or equal to every element in `s` starting from the second element, otherwise `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to `h`, the first and last elements of the list `s` have been swapped, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0, `s[p]` and `s[k - 1]` have been swapped.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the first element of the list `s`, and `s` is a non-empty list. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of the list `s`, and `s` is the list without its first element (if it originally had more than one element). If `i` equals `h`, then `z` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` becomes greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the third element of the list `s` (without its first element), `s` is the list without its first element, `z` is 1 if the third element of `s` equals `h`, otherwise `z` is unchanged. Additionally, `ans1` is 1 in both cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
