Output State: **`d1[i + 2]` is set to 1 plus the previous value of `d1[i + 1]`, and `i` is now `i + 1`.**

This means that the value of `d1[i + 2]` is updated to be 1 more than the value of `d1[i + 1]` before the code was executed. Additionally, the value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their original state, and the condition that `i + 1` must be within the range `1` to `n-2` still holds true.
