Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The program counts the number of `1`s in each row and checks if the first two rows have the same count to decide if the shape is a square. This logic is flawed because:
   - For a square, the count of `1`s in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the count of `1`s in each row increases by 2 for each subsequent row until the middle row, then decreases symmetrically.

2. **Triangle Identification**: The program should check the pattern of `1`s to confirm if they form a triangle. Specifically, it should verify if the `1`s are symmetrically increasing and decreasing around the center.

3. **Square Identification**: Similarly, the program should ensure that the `1`s are evenly distributed across the rows, forming a square.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for Triangle
        is_triangle = True
        for i in range(n // 2):
            if grid[i][n // 2 - i:n // 2 + i + 1].count('1') != 2 * i + 1:
                is_triangle = False
                break
        for i in range(n // 2 + 1, n):
            if grid[i][n // 2 - i + n % 2:n // 2 + i + 1 - n % 2].count('1') != 2 * (n - i - 1) + 1:
                is_triangle = False
                break
        
        # Check for Square
        is_square = True
        for i in range(n):
            if grid[i].count('1') != n - abs(i - n // 2):
                is_square = False
                break
        
        if is_triangle:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        elif is_square:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('NEITHER')

func()
```

This corrected version properly identifies whether the shape is a triangle or a square by checking the specific patterns required for each shape.
