Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`. This means `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 until it reaches a value that is no longer less than `2 * n`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, let's consider the possible values of `i` based on the given condition. If `i` is currently at the end of the previous iteration, it must have been an even number (0, 2, 4, ...). 

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`. Given that `i` was incremented by 2 in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to the next even number, which is `i + 2`. Additionally, since the loop condition depends on `n` being greater than 0, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Update the State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is `score` is `l[i + 2] + l[i]`, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 2`, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `score` is `l[(i + 2) + 2] + l[(i + 2)]`, `n` must be greater than 0**

However, to simplify the state representation, we can just focus on the relevant variables `i` and `n`:

**State: `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we represent it as `i + 2` to indicate the next value of `i` in the sequence.

Thus, the final answer is:

**State: `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0**
