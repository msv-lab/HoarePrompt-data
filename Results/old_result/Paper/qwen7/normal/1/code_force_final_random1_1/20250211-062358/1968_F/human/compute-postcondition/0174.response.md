Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, resulting in the `results` list being fully populated with 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop. The `idx` variable has been incremented by 2 for each iteration, and now points to the position right after the last processed element in `data`. The `total`, `t`, `n`, and `q` variables remain unchanged, still holding their initial values. The `a` array and `pf` array have been updated to include the cumulative XOR results of all elements processed so far. The `mp` dictionary contains the indices where each cumulative XOR result occurs in `a`.**

This means that after the loop completes, the `results` list will contain the final verdicts ('YES' or 'NO') for all queries processed according to the given conditions. The `idx` will point to the next available position in `data` to process, and the other variables (`total`, `t`, `n`, `q`) will retain their initial values since they were not modified within the loop. The `a` and `pf` arrays will reflect the cumulative XOR operations performed over all elements processed, and the `mp` dictionary will map each unique cumulative XOR result to its indices in `a`.
