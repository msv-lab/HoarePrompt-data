Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v = v - 1`, `na_frente` is an integer (unchanged), `pos_final` is an integer (unchanged), `best` is an integer (unchanged), and `total` is an integer that is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

This means that the value of `v` has been updated to `v - 1`, while `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `best`, and `total` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `total` variable is now increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
