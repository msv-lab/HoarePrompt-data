You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Output

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

The length of a and x is n, where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. The values in x are sorted in ascending order and are non-zero, with -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n for all i.

    #State: Output State: `distance` is equal to the maximum value found in the list `x` plus 1, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `rest` is 0, and all values in the list `a` indexed by `sorted_indices` are reduced to 0 or remain unchanged based on the deductions made during the loop iterations.
    #
    #This output state is derived from the understanding that the loop continues to increment `distance` until all elements in the list `a` indexed by `sorted_indices` are reduced to 0. The variable `pos` reaches the end of `sorted_indices` once all elements have been processed. The `rest` variable starts fresh at the beginning of each outer loop iteration but is eventually reduced to 0 as it is used to decrement the values in `a`. The `distance` variable increases with each full cycle of the outer loop, stopping when the condition to exit the loop is met.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `a` representing the health of the monsters, a list of integers `x` representing the initial positions of the monsters, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. It returns `True` if it can reduce the health of all monsters to zero using the given number of bullets per second, otherwise it returns `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.

        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer minus the total number of iterations executed, `n` is an input integer for each iteration, `k` is an input integer for each iteration, `a` is a list of integers updated with new input values split by spaces and converted to integers for each iteration, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())` for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. For each iteration, `n` and `k` will be the values entered by the user, `a` will be updated with the new list of integers entered by the user, and `x` will also be updated with the new list of integers entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists `a` and `x`. It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to check a certain condition. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `a` (list of monster healths), `x` (list of monster positions), and `k` (number of bullets).
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distances from the origin (0).
   - It iterates through the sorted indices and tries to kill the monsters.
   - For each group of monsters at the same distance from the origin, it checks if they can be killed before moving closer.
   - If a monster cannot be killed before it reaches the player, it returns `False`.
   - If all monsters can be killed, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters (`n`) and the number of bullets (`k`).
   - It then reads the healths of the monsters (`a`) and their positions (`x`).
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints `YES` if the player can survive, otherwise `NO`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Sorting Based on Distance**:
   - The sorting step ensures that we handle monsters closest to the player first, which is crucial because the player must kill monsters before they can move closer.

2. **Killing Monsters**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted indices and tries to kill monsters using the available bullets.
   - It correctly handles the case where multiple monsters are at the same distance from the player and ensures that enough bullets are used to kill them before they move closer.

3. **Checking if a Monster Can Be Killed**:
   - The function checks if a monster can be killed before it reaches the player by ensuring that the player has enough bullets to reduce its health to zero before it moves.
   - If a monster cannot be killed before it reaches the player, the function immediately returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as when there are no bullets left or when a monster is already dead.
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where the player cannot kill all monsters before they reach the player.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the functions, it appears that the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` is correct according to the problem statement. The function correctly determines whether the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player.
