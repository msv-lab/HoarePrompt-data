Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `k` is an integer input from the user.
- `t` is decremented by 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is `print(ceil(k / 2))`.

The `ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division of `k` by 2. Since the value of `k` is an integer input from the user, we need to consider the result of `k / 2` and then apply the ceiling function to it.

Output: **ceil(k / 2)**
