Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - 2 * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is greater than 0, and `opNum` is now equal to `a[n - 3]`.**

Explanation: The line `opNum = a[i]` assigns the current value of `a[i]` (which is `-a[n - 3]`) to `opNum`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
