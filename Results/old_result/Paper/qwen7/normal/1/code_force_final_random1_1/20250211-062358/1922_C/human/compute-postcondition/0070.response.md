Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers inputted by the user, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`m`, `j`, `x`, `y`, `d1`, `d2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
