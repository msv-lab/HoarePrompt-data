Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` remains the same, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `l = map(int, input().split())` takes a new input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, and then maps each of these strings to an integer, creating a map object `l`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `lis`, and `test` remain unchanged from their initial states.
