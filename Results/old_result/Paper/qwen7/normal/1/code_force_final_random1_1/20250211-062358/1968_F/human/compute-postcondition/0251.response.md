Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that `q` is decremented by 1, `idx` is increased by 24, `l` is set to the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is set to the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, and `x` is the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
