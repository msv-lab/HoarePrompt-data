Output State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [2, 1, 1], `tot` is equal to `tot` + 2.**

Explanation: The value of `a` remains unchanged at 2. The list `L` also remains unchanged. The variable `tot` is incremented by the value of `a`, which is 2. Since the exact initial value of `tot` was not specified, it is described as `tot` is equal to `tot` + 2. All other conditions and preconditions remain valid.
