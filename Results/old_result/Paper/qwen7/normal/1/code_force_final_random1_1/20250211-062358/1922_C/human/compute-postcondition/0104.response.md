Output State: **`d2[i]` is updated to `1 + d2[i + 1]` for `i` ranging from `1` to `n - 3`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `1 + d2[i + 1]` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `n - 3`. This means that starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n - 3`, the value of `d2[i]` is incremented by `1` plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. The initial conditions and other variables remain unchanged.
