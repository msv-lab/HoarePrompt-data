Output State: **`i` is the second element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `sx` is the new `i` plus the previous value of `sx`, `sx` is updated by `y * 2` added to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Given that `y` is already decreased by `i // 2`, `sx` now includes this additional value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
