Postcondition: `bOnes` is 2 if `i` is in list `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in both lists `a` and `b` and the number of 1s in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 1s in `b`; otherwise, `bOnes` remains 2; `i` must be less than `k`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
