Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the components involved in the print statement:

1. **`ans`**: This variable is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.
2. **`i`**: This variable iterates from `0` to `n - m - 1`.
3. **`curr`**: This variable is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i]` and `a[i + m]` being in `b_values` and the corresponding counts in `cnt_b`.
4. **`cnt_b`**: This variable is adjusted accordingly based on the conditions mentioned above.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `k`, `n`, and `m` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is incremented by 1 for every instance where `curr` meets the specified condition.

Given this information, the print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the count of occurrences where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of occurrences where curr is greater than or equal to k)**
