Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, and `lst` remains the same list as after the third iteration; `final` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `final = []` initializes an empty list named `final`. This operation does not affect the values of `mini` or `lst`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `mini` and `lst`, while introducing a new empty list `final`.
