Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is an empty list, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is an empty list, `s` is a list of characters, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 2)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 2)`, and if the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` is true, then the condition remains true. If the condition is false, the values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` do not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 0, and `one_perc` is calculated as ((`o` - 2) * 100) // (`n` - 2), and `lst` is [2]. This is because if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `i` becomes 2, and `lst` is updated to include the value 2. If the condition is not met, `i` remains 1, but since there is no else part provided, the other variables retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `zero` is either 2 or 1, `one` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 66.67, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [2, 4] if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, `lst` remains as [2].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
