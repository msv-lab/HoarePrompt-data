Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the state changes within the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, we know that the value at `x[j-1]` influences the increments of `a[i]` and `a[j]`. Specifically:
   - If `x[j-1]` is 'F', both `a[i]` and `a[j]` are incremented by 1.
   - If `x[j-1]` is 'S', the value at `x[j]` remains 'S' and if `x[j]` was not already incremented, it is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the current value of `j` (let's call it `j_end`), and `n` is the same as before.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `j_end + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is increased by 1 for the next iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j_end + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `x` remains the same array.
   - `a[i]` and `a[j]` may have been incremented depending on the value of `x[j-1]` during the previous iteration, but these specific values are not directly stated to change for the next iteration.
   - The only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted is `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`x` is an array, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are integers, `j` is `j_end + 1`, and `n` is the same as before.**
