Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is given as being greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to start at 0.
   - `n` is already stated to be greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

5. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - `i` should be 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (already stated).

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should include the adjustments for `i` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
