Output State: **`i` is "400003", `j` is "4", `pd['400003']` is `int('400003') + 4**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `pd['400003']` by converting `j` to an integer (which is 4) and adding it to the current value of `pd['400003']`. Since the initial value of `pd['400003']` is not specified, we assume it was previously set to an integer value (let's say `x`). After executing the code, `pd['400003']` becomes `x + 4`. However, since the exact initial value of `pd['400003']` is not given, we express it as the sum of the original value and 4. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
