Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `A[l - 1]` if `l - r <= 0`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to the current value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `b` is updated to its new value, `a` is defined as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is set to `A[l - 1]` if `l - r <= 0`.
