Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers inputted by the user, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers inputted by the user split by spaces, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, and `d1[2]` is set to 1.**

The code `d1[2] = 1` sets the value of `d1[2]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
