Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `curr` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `i` is `k + 1`, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `k + 1` in the list `a`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
