Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i] == b[i]` for all executed iterations, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i] == b[i]` for all executed iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The `new` list will contain the maximum values of the corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for all indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. Similarly, the `new2` list will contain the minimum values of the corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for all such indices.
