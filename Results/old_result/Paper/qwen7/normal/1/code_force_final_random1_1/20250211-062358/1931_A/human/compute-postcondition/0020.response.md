Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'az'**.

Explanation: The code appends `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` to the `word` string. Given that `n` is an input integer, `n - 28` will determine the character from the `alphabet` list (assuming `alphabet` is a predefined list of characters). However, since the exact content of `alphabet` is not provided, we can only say that `word` will be `'az'` regardless of the value of `n`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
