Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains n integers representing array a, the second line contains m integers representing array b, and the third line contains t test cases. Additionally, the sum of n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in both `a` and `b` up to `k`, `aOnes` is the total count of numbers present in `a` up to `k` but not in `b` or present in `b` with a count less than or equal to `bOnes`, `newk` is `k // 2`, and the condition `aOnes == newk` and `bOnes == newk` either holds true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is set to `k + 1`, `bOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in both `a` and `b` up to `k`, `aOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in `a` up to `k`, adjusted based on the comparison with `bOnes` and the condition involving `newk`, `k` retains its original value, and `newk` is updated to `k // 2`. This holds true regardless of whether the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is met or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bOnes` will be the total count of numbers that are present in both lists `a` and `b` and satisfy the condition where the number of occurrences of the number in `a` is less than or equal to the number of occurrences in `b`. The value of `t` remains `n + 1`, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `aOnes` remains 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is `k + 1`. Regardless of whether the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true or false, `bOnes` will be updated accordingly to reflect the count of numbers meeting the specified conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
