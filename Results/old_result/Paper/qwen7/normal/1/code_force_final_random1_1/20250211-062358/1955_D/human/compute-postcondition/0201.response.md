Output State: **`a[i]` is an element of array `a`, `b_values` retains its previous set of values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is decremented by 1, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + m`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i + m]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
