Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - m`, `n - m` must be less than `m`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `i` is defined as `n - m`, and `n - m` must be less than `m`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that the count of the element `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` has been incremented by 1.
