You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the binary string), and a binary string `arr` representing cells (0 for free, 1 for containing a chip). For each test case, it finds the first and last positions of '1' in `arr`, extracts the substring between these positions, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. The function outputs the count of '0's for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of cells.
   - It then reads a string of `n` characters (either '0' or '1') representing the state of the cells.

2. **Finding Chip Positions:**
   - The program converts the input string to a single string using `input('').split()` and then joins it with an empty string (`''.join(...)`).
   - It finds the index of the first '1' (chip) in the string using `arr.find('1')`.
   - It finds the index of the last '1' (chip) from the right in the reversed string using `arr[::-1].find('1')`.

3. **Extracting Relevant Part of the String:**
   - The program extracts a substring `z` from the original string `arr` starting from the position of the first '1' to the position just before the last '1' from the right.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the extracted substring `z` using `z.count('0')`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling Multiple Chips:**
   - The program only considers the first and last chips found in the string. If there are multiple chips, this approach will not correctly determine the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Operations:**
   - The logic used to count the number of '0's in the extracted substring does not accurately represent the minimum number of operations required. The number of operations needed to move all chips to form a single block is not simply the number of free cells between the first and last chip.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the chips are already in a single block or when the chips are spread out in a way that requires more than just moving one chip.

### Correct Solution

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the minimum number of operations to move all chips to form a single block. This can be done by finding the maximum distance between consecutive chips and adding 1 to it. Here’s how the corrected solution would look:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chips = [i for i, x in enumerate(arr) if x == 1]
        if len(chips) == 1:
            print(0)
        else:
            max_distance = 0
            for i in range(1, len(chips)):
                max_distance = max(max_distance, chips[i] - chips[i-1] - 1)
            print(max_distance)

func()
```
