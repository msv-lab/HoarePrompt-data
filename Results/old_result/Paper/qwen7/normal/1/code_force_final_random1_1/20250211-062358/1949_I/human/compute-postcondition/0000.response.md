Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, x and y are lists of n integers each, representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, r is a list of n integers, representing the radii of the disks respectively, visited is a list of n boolean values indicating whether a disk has been visited during the DFS, and coef is a list of n floating-point numbers used to calculate the coefficients for the disks' tangency conditions.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The constraint on `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) is preserved.
