Output State: **`p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, and `resultats` remain unchanged. The loop continues to the next iteration.
