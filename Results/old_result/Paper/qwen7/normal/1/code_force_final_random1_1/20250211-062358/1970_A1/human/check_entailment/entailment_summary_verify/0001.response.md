### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to perform a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on their balance and position, and constructing a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used for sorting but is not actually used in the main function `func_2`. However, the sorting logic in `func_2` is correct and sufficient for the task.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Balance Calculation**: The function correctly computes the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the position and character in a list `balance_info`.
   - **Sorting Logic**: The lambda function in the `sort` method sorts the `balance_info` list by balance (ascending) and position (descending). This ensures that the sequence is sorted according to the problem requirements.
   - **Character Construction**: The final sequence is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted list, which is correct.

4. **Verification**:
   - **Balance Calculation**: The balance is correctly computed for each prefix.
   - **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic ensures that the sequence is sorted by balance (ascending) and then by position (descending).
   - **Character Construction**: The final sequence is constructed correctly by joining the characters from the sorted list.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation for a balanced parentheses sequence.

Final: **True**
