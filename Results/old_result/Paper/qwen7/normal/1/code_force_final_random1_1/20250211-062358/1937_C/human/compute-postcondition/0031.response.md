Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Update the states**: 
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from the previous value (which was 1), so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, which means `n` must still be greater than `n-1`.

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state:

State: **`best` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `res` is an input string and its current value is '<'**
