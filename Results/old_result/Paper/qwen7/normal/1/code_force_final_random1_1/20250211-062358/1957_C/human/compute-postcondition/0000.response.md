Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each move you made are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two rooks share the same row or column after each move and its mirrored move by the computer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `dp[1]` to 1. This changes the value of `dp[1]`, but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or the coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` which remain as per the initial state.
