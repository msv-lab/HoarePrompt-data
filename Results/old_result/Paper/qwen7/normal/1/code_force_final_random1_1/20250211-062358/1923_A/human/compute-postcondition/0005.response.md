Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string obtained by joining the input string after splitting it on spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, if '1' is not found, `x` is -1; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string).**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. If '1' is not found, it returns -1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
