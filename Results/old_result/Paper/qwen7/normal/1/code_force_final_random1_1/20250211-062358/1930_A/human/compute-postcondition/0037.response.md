Output State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i + 6]`, `i` is `i + 4`**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Initially, `i` was `i + 2`, so now `i` is updated to `i + 4`. The value of `score` is increased by the element at index `i + 6` in list `l`.
