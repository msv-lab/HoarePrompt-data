Output State: **`custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`, `num_fila` must be greater than or equal to `max_p`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += b_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by `b_values[y]`. The conditions and relationships involving `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, and `max_p` remain unchanged.
