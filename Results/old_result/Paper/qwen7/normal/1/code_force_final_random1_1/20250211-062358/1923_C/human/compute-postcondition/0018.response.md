Output State: **`i` is increased by `x`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, and if `x` equals 1, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. The value of `x` is the next element in the list `l`. If `x` equals 1, then `j` is increased by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. The other variables (`l` and `j`) retain their original conditions.
