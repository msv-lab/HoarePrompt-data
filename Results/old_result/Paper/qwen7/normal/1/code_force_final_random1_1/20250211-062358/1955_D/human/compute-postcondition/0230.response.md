Output State: `b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration from `n - m` to `n - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. The variable `cnt_b[b[i]]` will be incremented by 1 for each value of `i` starting from `n - m` up to `n - 1`. Therefore, `cnt_b[b[i]]` will reflect the count of each `b[i]` value within this range.
