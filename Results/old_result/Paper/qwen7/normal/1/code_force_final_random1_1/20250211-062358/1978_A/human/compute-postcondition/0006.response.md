Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t` and `_`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `n` being an input integer is maintained, but its specific value is now determined by the user's input.
