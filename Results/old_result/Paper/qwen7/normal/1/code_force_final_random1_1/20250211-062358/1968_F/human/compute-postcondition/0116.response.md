Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` is `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 4, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is appended with `i`.**

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated value of `idx` is the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 4.
