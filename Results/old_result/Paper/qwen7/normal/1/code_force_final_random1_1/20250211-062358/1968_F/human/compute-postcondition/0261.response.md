Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` has 'NO' appended to it, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `r` in the sorted list `v2` minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `results.append('NO')` appends 'NO' to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the previous state of `results`, it now includes 'NO'.
- No other variables are modified by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
