Based on the initial state provided, the `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element and going up to the last element in steps of \(2 \times (n-1)\), where \(n\) is the length of the list `l`.

Let's break it down:

1. **List `l`**: The list `l` remains unchanged.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., \(2 \times (n-1)\) (if they exist) is stored in `score`.
3. **Variable `i`**: After the loop, `i` is set to \(2 \times n - 1\).

Given these points, the `print(score)` statement will print the sum of the specified elements in the list `l`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of elements l[0], l[2], l[4], ..., l[2*(n-1)] if such elements exist in the list l)**
