Output State: **`dfs(i)` has been called, `coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, and `ok` is False.**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function has been called with `i` as the argument. The initial values of `coef[i+1]`, `coef[i]`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remain unchanged, but the function call itself is now part of the current state.
