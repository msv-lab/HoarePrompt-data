Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the new input received, `t` remains the same. If the set `a` (containing the unique characters from the new input received) has exactly 2 elements, the program does nothing additional. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of the unique characters from the new input received, and `c` is a string containing the sorted unique characters from the new input in reverse order.
