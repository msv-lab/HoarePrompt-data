Output State: **`i` is `feat[0] - 1`; `n` is `feat[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `feat[0]` to the variable `n`. The value of `i` is updated to `feat[0] - 1` because `i` was initially `n - 1`, and now `n` is `feat[0]`. The list `feat` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
