Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `best` is `2`
   - `i` is `2`
   - `k` is `2`
   - `res` is an input string with the current value `<`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `2` and the loop increments `i` by default (assuming no other operations inside the loop change `i`), `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now `3`, `n` must be greater than `3`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes `3`
   - `n` must be greater than `3`

6. **Other variables (`best`, `k`, and `res`) remain unchanged**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`best` is `2`, `i` is `3`, `k` is `2`, `res` is an input string, and `n` must be greater than `3`**.
