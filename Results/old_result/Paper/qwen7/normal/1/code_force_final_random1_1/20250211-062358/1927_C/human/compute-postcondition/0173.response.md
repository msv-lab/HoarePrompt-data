Postcondition: `bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `bOnes` is 0. `t` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`.
