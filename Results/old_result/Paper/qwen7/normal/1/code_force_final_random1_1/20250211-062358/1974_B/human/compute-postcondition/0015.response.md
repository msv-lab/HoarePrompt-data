Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `char` becomes the next character in `s`, `j` is adjusted (decremented if `char` is in `unique_chars`, incremented otherwise), and `unique_chars` is updated to include the character `i`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` inserts the character `char` at index `i` in the list `unique_chars`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `j` is adjusted based on whether `char` is already in `unique_chars` (decremented if it is, incremented otherwise).
