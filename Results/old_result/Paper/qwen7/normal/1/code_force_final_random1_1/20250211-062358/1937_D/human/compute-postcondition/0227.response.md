Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` itself is not used in the calculation).
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `r` is decreased by 1.
   - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)`.
   - `b` is calculated as `B[r - 1] - B[r - l - 1] - (idx_B[r - l - 1] - 2) * (r - l - 1)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

To determine the exact output, let's focus on the values of `a` and `b`.

### Calculation of `a`:
- `a = A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)`
- We need the values of `A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - 1]` to proceed. Since these are not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a`.

### Calculation of `b`:
- `b = B[r - 1] - B[r - l - 1] - (idx_B[r - l - 1] - 2) * (r - l - 1)`
- Similarly, we need the values of `B[r - 1]`, `B[r - l - 1]`, and `idx_B[r - l - 1]` to proceed. Since these are not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `b`.

### Final Expression:
- The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
- Given `i = 2`, the expression simplifies to `2a + 2b + 2 + 1 = 2a + 2b + 3`.

Since we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`, we express the output in terms of `a` and `b`.

### Output:
Output: **2a + 2b + 3**
