Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element which is a `BalanceInfo` object with `balance` equal to 0 and `i` equal to 0, `balance` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a `BalanceInfo` object to the `balance_info` list. The `BalanceInfo` object is initialized with `balance` set to 0 and `i` set to 0 since no specific index `i` was provided in the code snippet. The initial values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged, and `balance` remains 0 as no operations were performed on it within the given code snippet.
