Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `v`, `na_frente`, `-1`, and `na_frente - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `v` will take on values starting from `na_frente` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches `-1`.
   - For the loop to start, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. If `na_frente` were less than `-1`, the loop would never start because `v` would never reach `-1`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - The value of `v` will start from `na_frente` and decrement, but we don't need to specify the exact value of `v` since the loop will start as long as `na_frente` is valid.

4. **Other variables**:
   - `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `na_frente` being greater than or equal to `-1`.

**State:**
**`na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1**
