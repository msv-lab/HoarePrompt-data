Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `test_cases` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`. Since `i` is currently 2, this means `test_cases` must be at least 3.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - `test_cases` must still be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Summarize the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `test_cases` must be at least 3.

Given the conditions and the loop structure, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `test_cases`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `test_cases` must be at least 3**
