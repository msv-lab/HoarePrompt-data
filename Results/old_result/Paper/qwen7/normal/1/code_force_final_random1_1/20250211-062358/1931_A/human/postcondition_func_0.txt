The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78). For each `n`, it constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is set to 'zz'; if `n` is greater than 26, `word` is set to 'az'; otherwise, `word` is set to 'aaa'. The function prints `word` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value.
