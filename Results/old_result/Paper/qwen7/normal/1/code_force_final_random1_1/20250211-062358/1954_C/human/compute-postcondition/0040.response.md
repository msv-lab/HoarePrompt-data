Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(a)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations.
- `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations.
- `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

This statement joins the elements of the `new` list into a single string, converting each element to a string first.

Since `new` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations, the output will be a string composed of these maximum values concatenated together.

Output: **the string composed of the maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations**
