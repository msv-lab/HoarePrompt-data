Output State: The value of `ans` will be the maximum value it attains during the entire execution of the loop for all test cases. This value is determined by checking all possible `i` values from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` for each test case and updating `ans` whenever a larger valid `i` is found that satisfies the given conditions.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` will hold the highest value it has been assigned during any iteration across all test cases, based on the conditions provided.
