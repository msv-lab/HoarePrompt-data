Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. It sorts the list of chosen vertices, which is necessary to calculate the differences between consecutive vertices.
3. The logic for calculating `ans` is based on the differences between consecutive chosen vertices and whether additional vertices (`y`) can be used to form more triangles.
4. The program handles the edge case where the first and last chosen vertices form a potential triangle with the total number of vertices (`n`).
5. The final step ensures that the calculated number of triangles does not exceed `n - 2`, which is a valid constraint given the problem statement.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the inputs as expected and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
