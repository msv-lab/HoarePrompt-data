Postcondition: `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, and `final` is either `[0]` or `[n]` depending on whether `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, since the else part is not present, the postcondition directly follows the if part.
