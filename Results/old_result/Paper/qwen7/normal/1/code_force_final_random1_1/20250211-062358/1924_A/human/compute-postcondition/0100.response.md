Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` remains the same, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 4, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to 0, which changes the value of `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
