The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \). It then iterates over possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) to count pairs \((x, y)\) such that both \( x \) and \( y \) are coprime, and the product \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). Finally, it prints the total count of such pairs.
