Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, and `b` is updated based on whether `l - r - 1` is greater than 0 or not: if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, otherwise `b` is `b + A[l - 1]`.
