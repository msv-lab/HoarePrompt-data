Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in lst`. The variables involved here are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `lst`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `lst` must contain at least one element, after one iteration, it will contain at least one fewer element (assuming the loop removes or modifies elements appropriately).
   - `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. This means `mini` will either stay the same or decrease if `abs(pk - ele)` is smaller than the current `mini`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `lst` must contain at least one fewer element than before.
- `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, but we don't know the exact new value of `mini` without knowing the specific value of `ele` and `pk`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `lst` contains at least one fewer element and `mini` is updated accordingly.

**State:**
`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

However, to be more precise, we can say:

**State:**
`lst` must contain at least one fewer element, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

This ensures that the loop condition is still met and `mini` is correctly updated.
