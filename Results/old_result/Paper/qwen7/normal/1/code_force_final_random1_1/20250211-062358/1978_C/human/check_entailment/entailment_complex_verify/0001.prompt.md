You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.

    #State: The loop will continue to decrement `i` by 2 until `i` is no longer less than or equal to 0. At that point, the function `func_2(c, k, l)` will be returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It processes these parameters through a series of conditional checks and function calls. If `k` is zero, it returns the initial list `l`. Otherwise, it iteratively decreases `i` by 2 starting from `n`, updating `c` and `k` accordingly. Depending on the conditions met during each iteration, it either returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` or the modified list `l` after calling `func_3(c, l)`. The final state of the program is determined by the specific case that matches the given conditions, ultimately returning either the unchanged initial list `l`, or the result of subsequent function calls involving `c`, `k`, and `l`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= c < len(l), k is an integer such that 0 <= k < len(l), and l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.
def func_2(c, k, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[-c - k]
    l[-c], l[-c - k] = y, x
    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` which is a permutation of length n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer within the range of the list length), `k` (an integer within the range of the list length), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length n). It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c-k` in the list `l`. After the swap, the function returns the modified list `l`, which remains a permutation of length n.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is an integer such that 1 <= c <= len(l)/2, and l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.
def func_3(c, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[c - 1]
    l[c - 1], l[-c] = x, y
    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `c` (where \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{\text{len}(l)}{2}\)) and a list `l` of integers. It swaps the elements at positions `c-1` and `-c` in the list `l`. After performing the swap, it returns the modified list `l`. If no swap is performed (i.e., when the conditions are not met), it still returns the original list `l` unchanged.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}, and k is even if n is odd.

        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. If `n` is odd, `k` is odd and `max_k` is set to \( n \). If `n` is even, `k` is even and `max_k` is set to \( n \).
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values, both of which are 0.

    return n, k
    #The program returns n, which is an integer between 1 and 200000, and k, which is an integer between 0 and 1000000000000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It checks if \(k\) is odd when \(n\) is odd, and if \(n\) is odd, it calculates the maximum possible value of \(k\) as \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\). If \(k\) exceeds this maximum value, it returns two zeros (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \(n\) and \(k\). The function can return either two zeros (0, 0) or an integer \(n\) between 1 and 200000 and an integer \(k\) between 0 and 1000000000000.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers where each integer represents a position in the permutation of length n such that 1 <= l[i] <= n and all positions are distinct.
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `l` must contain at least one element.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `l`. Since the question does not specify any condition that would cause the loop to terminate (such as modifying `l` within the loop to remove elements or setting a break condition), the loop will keep running until `l` is empty. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is that `l` must contain at least one element, which in this case would mean `l` is empty. However, based on the given information and the format required, we can only state that `l` must contain at least one element before the loop starts, which remains true even after all iterations.
    print()
    #This is printed: ()
    return
    #The program returns a list `l` that must contain at least one element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `l` of integers, where each integer represents a position in the permutation of length `n` such that 1 <= l[i] <= n and all positions are distinct. It prints 'YES' followed by the elements of `l` in a single line, then prints an empty tuple `()`. The function ensures that the returned list `l` contains at least one element.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
def func_6():
    n, k = func_4()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns k, which is an integer between 0 and 10^12
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12, they are the results of `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and determines whether to return an integer \( k \) between 0 and \( 10^{12} \) or None. If \( n \) (obtained from `func_4()`) is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it processes \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_1()` and `func_5()`, then returns None.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code consists of several functions, but the main logic is in `func_5` and `func_6`.
   - `func_4` checks if the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( k \). If not, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value.
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are helper functions used to swap elements in the list.

3. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The function `func_1` should correctly construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - The function `func_4` should correctly calculate the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - The overall structure of the code should handle all edge cases and produce the correct output.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - `func_4` correctly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
   - `func_1` has issues:
     - It incorrectly handles the decrement of `k` and the construction of the permutation.
     - The logic for constructing the permutation is flawed and does not guarantee a valid permutation for all cases.
     - The use of recursive calls in `func_1` and `func_3` is unnecessary and complicates the logic without adding value.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not ensure that the constructed permutation has the correct Manhattan value.
   - The code fails to handle certain edge cases and does not produce a valid permutation in some scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
