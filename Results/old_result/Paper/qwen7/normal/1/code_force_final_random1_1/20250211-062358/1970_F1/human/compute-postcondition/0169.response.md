Postcondition: **`allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element, `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, `isPlayer(obj)` is True or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`, `com` is equal to 'T'. If `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `team` is `team_value` (the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`) and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.**
