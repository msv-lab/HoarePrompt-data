Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: The goal is to find the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice can choose any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
   - Bob can only choose and remove elements from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

### Given Program Analysis

1. **Import Statements**:
   ```python
   import math as m
   import collections as c
   ```
   These imports are unnecessary for the solution and can be removed.

2. **Unnecessary Functions**:
   ```python
   def build_tree(n, arr):
       ...
   def bs(arr, x):
       ...
   def kadane(arr):
       ...
   def dfs(root, par, tree):
       ...
   ```
   These functions are not used in the solution and can be removed.

3. **Main Logic**:
   ```python
   big = 1000000007
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       n = int(input())
       arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
       func_1(arr)
   ```

4. **Helper Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(arr):
       nums = c.Counter(arr)
       start = 0
       vis = set()
       while nums.get(start, 0):
           vis.add(start)
           nums[start] -= 1
           if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
               nums[start + 1] -= 1
               start += 1
           else:
               print(start + 1)
               return
       print(start)
   ```

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Initialization**:
  - `nums` is a counter of the elements in `arr`.
  - `start` is initialized to 0.
  - `vis` is a set to keep track of visited indices.

- **While Loop**:
  - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `nums` at index `start`.
  - `vis` is updated to mark `start` as visited.
  - `nums[start]` is decremented.
  - If `start + 1` exists in `nums`, it is also decremented and `start` is incremented.
  - If no such element exists, the current `start` value is printed and the function returns.

### Correctness Check

1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice should aim to place the smallest missing integer in `c` by choosing elements strategically.
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate Alice's and Bob's turns or their optimal strategies.

2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - Bob should try to prevent Alice from placing the smallest missing integer in `c`.
   - The current logic does not account for Bob's optimal moves.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The logic does not correctly calculate the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the game rules or the optimal strategies for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
