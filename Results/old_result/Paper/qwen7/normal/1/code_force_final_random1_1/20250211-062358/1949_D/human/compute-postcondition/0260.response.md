Based on the initial state provided, the value of `nx` is constructed within a loop, but no specific details about the loop or the construction of `nx` are given. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `nx`.

Given this lack of specific information, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **nx (where nx is the value constructed within the loop)**
