Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the nth row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the nth row in `gr`; `impossible` is False.**

Explanation: The line `impossible = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `impossible`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `m`, or the conditions related to the list `gr`. Therefore, those conditions remain unchanged.
