Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is `n - (n + 1 // 2)`, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing three elements `[n + 1 // 2, m, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Initially, `L` contains two elements `[n + 1 // 2, m]`. After appending `m`, `L` now contains three elements: `[n + 1 // 2, m, m]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged.
