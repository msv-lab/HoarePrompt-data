Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `3`, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - opNum - 2 * opNum - opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it simply exits the current context. None of the variable values are changed by the `break` statement, so they remain as they were in the initial state. The only effect is that we know the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
