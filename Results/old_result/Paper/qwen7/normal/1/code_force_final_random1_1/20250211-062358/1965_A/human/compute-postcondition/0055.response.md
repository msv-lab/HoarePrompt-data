Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, and `test` is True. The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1.**
