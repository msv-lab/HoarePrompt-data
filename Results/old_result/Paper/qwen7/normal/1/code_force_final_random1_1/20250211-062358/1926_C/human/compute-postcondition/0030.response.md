Output State: **`i` is "400003", `j` is "4", `pd['400003']` is 400008**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pd['400003']` by adding the integer value of `j` (which is 4) to its current value (which is 400007). Therefore, the new value of `pd['400003']` becomes 400008. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
