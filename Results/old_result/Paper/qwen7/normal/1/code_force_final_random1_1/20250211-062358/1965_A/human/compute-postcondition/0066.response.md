Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `j` ranges from 1 to `len(lis) - 1`. Therefore, the only variable that changes within this loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is an input integer
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements
   - `j` is 1 (current value)
   - `test` is False if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains True

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j < len(lis)`. Since `j` is currently 1, the next iteration will occur if `len(lis) > 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string.
   - `lis` remains unchanged as it is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.
   - `test` remains unchanged based on the condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 2, and `test` remains False if `lis[2] - lis[1] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains True.**
