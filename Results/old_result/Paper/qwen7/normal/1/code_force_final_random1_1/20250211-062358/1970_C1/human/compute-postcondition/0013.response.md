Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` now contains the elements `a` appended to it, `lst[a]` now contains the element `b` appended to its previous content, `a` is updated to a new integer value from input, `b` is updated to a new integer value from input**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `lst[a]`. The initial state of `lst[a]` is that it contains the element `b`. After executing the code, `lst[a]` will contain both the original element `b` and the new element `b` appended to it, making it a list with two identical elements `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
