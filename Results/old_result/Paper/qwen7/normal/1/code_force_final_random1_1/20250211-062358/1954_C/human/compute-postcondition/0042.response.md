Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is equal to `len(a)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations.
- `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations.
- `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations.

### Loop Statement
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head does not contain any variables that are directly modified within the loop. The loop simply increments an implicit counter (which is represented by `_`), but it does not change the values of `i`, `new`, or `new2`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop continues as long as the user inputs a positive integer. Once the input is no longer a positive integer, the loop terminates.

### Conclusion
Since the loop head does not modify any variables and the loop continues based on user input, the only thing that can change is the user input itself. However, since the task is to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and there are no such objects, the states of `i`, `new`, and `new2` remain unchanged.

### Final State
The states of `i`, `new`, and `new2` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations, and `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations.**
