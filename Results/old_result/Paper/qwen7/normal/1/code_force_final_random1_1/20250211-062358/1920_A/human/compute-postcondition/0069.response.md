Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num` is an empty list.
- `i` is the first element of `num`, which is currently an empty list.
- The postcondition states that `num` remains an empty list and `i` remains as the first element of `num`, which is an empty list, and there is no change in the value of `count_num`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `num` contains elements. Since `num` is an empty list at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute because there are no elements in `num`.

### Conclusion:
Since `num` is an empty list and the loop condition is based on the presence of elements in `num`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the state of `i` or `num` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list)**.

This is the same state as the initial state at the end of the previous iteration, indicating that the loop will not execute again due to the empty list condition.
