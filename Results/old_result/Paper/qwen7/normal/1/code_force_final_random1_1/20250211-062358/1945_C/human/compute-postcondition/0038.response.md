Output State: **`zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 1 or 3; `zero_perc` is either 50 or 100; `one_perc` is calculated as ((zero - one) * 100) // (n - (i + 2) - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 2 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `one` is incremented by 1, changing from either 0 or 2 to either 1 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged, including the calculation of `one_perc` which depends on the new value of `one`. Additionally, since `i` was previously 1 more than its previous value, it is now 2 more than its previous value. The list `lst` contains elements that are now `i + 1`, which is 3.
