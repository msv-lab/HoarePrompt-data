Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)` - 1, `rest` is `k` - `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, and `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `delta` to be the minimum between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Since `pos` is set to `len(sorted_indices) - 1`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` refers to the last element in the list `a` indexed by `sorted_indices`. However, the exact value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not given, so we keep it as `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The value of `rest` is reduced by `delta`, making it `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
