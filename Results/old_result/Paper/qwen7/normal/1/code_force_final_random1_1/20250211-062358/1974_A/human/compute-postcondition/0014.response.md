Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is equal to (`y` + 1) // 2, `m` is 15 * z - y * 4**

Explanation: The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, where `z` is defined as `(y + 1) // 2`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
