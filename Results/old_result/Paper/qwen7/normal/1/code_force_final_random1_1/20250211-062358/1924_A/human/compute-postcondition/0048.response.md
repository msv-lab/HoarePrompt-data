Output State: **`i` is 0; `cur` is an integer where the bit at position `i` is not set; `tmp` is 'a'**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the character 'a' to `tmp`. Since `i` is 0, `ord('a') + i` equals `ord('a')`, which is 97. Therefore, `chr(97)` results in 'a'. The values of `i` and `cur` remain unchanged from their initial state.
