Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is now `A[l]`, `b` is unchanged if `r` is 0, otherwise `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `r` is unchanged if `s[i]` is not '>', otherwise `r` is decreased by 1; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

This means that the value of `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values unless specified otherwise by the code, which in this case does not change them further.
