Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum score by selecting pairs of numbers and adding the minimum of the pair to the score.
2. The annotated program sorts the list of numbers before processing them. This ensures that when we take the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), they represent the smallest available numbers in each iteration.
3. By iterating over the sorted list in steps of 2, starting from the first element, the algorithm effectively pairs the smallest available numbers together, which maximizes the score since \(\min(x, y)\) is always added to the score.
4. The program correctly processes each test case as described in the problem statement and produces the expected output.

Given this analysis, the program logic aligns with the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
