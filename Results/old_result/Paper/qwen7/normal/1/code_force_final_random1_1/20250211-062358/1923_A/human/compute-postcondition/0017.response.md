Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1), `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` (if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`, `z` is assigned the value of `arr[x:n - y]`, `n` is updated to an input integer, the string `arr` is updated to a version without spaces.**

Explanation: The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` takes an input string, splits it into a list of words (removing any spaces), and then joins these words back into a single string without any spaces. This affects the variable `arr` by removing all spaces from the input string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions or values, except that `n` is now updated to the new input integer.
