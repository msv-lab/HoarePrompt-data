Functionality: **The function processes a list `a` of integers and prints the sum and maximum value of the list. It also generates and prints a series of index pairs `(l, r)` that represent operations performed on the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value; instead, it modifies and prints the output based on the input list `a`.**
