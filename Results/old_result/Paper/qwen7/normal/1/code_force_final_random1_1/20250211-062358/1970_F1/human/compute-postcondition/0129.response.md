Output State: **`ind` is equal to `len(line)`, `elements` contains entries for each non-`.` character in `line` with keys being the characters and values being tuples `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in `line`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then either `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` equals 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `ind` will be equal to the length of the `line` since the loop increments `ind` until it reaches the end of the `line`. The dictionary `elements` will contain entries for every non-`.` character in the final state of `line`, with each entry being a tuple `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in the final state of `line`. Additionally, if a character in `line` is a player (determined by `isPlayer`), `allPlayers` will mark it as `False`. If a character is not a player but ends with 'G', it will determine `tmp` based on whether the character starts with 'B' or not, and append `(i, ind)` to `goal[tmp]`.
