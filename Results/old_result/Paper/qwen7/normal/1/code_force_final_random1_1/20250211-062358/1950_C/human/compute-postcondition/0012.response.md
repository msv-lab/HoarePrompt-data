Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is the string input by the user, `h` is the first two characters of `s`, and `h` is not equal to '00'. If `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the postcondition remains as the precondition. If `int(h)` is greater than 12, the postcondition remains as the precondition.
