Output State: **`j` is equal to `m - 2`, `impossible` is True, `m` must be greater than 3, and `ans` is 'NO'**

Explanation: The code sets `impossible` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is still `m - 2`, `impossible` is now `True`, `m` must still be greater than 3, and `ans` remains 'NO'.
