Output State: **`x` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, and if `x` is 1, then `j` is increased by 1; `p` is a list containing the value of `i`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` was previously increased by 1, `p` now contains the value of `i`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or the conditions specified in the initial state.
