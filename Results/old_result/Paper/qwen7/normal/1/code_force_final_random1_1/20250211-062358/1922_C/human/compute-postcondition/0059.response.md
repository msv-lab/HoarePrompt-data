Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `j` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- Both `x` and `y` are converted from input to integers.

The print statement is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

Here, `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a dictionary where the keys are integers and the values are also integers. The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` subtracts the value associated with key `y` from the value associated with key `x`.

Since the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their keys.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
