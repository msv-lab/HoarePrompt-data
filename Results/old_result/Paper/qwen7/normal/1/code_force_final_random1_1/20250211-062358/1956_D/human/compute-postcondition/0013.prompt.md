You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    #This is printed: s (the sum of elements in list a), m (the maximum element in list a)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `ops` is a list that contains exactly the number of tuples equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, which is the same as the initial value of `n`.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ops` list will contain exactly `n` tuples. Each tuple represents a pair of indices `(l, r)` that were printed during each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `n` times based on the initial state where `n` is the length of the list `a`, the `ops` list will have `n` elements, each being a tuple that was printed during the corresponding iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined values within its scope. It returns a specific value based on the conditions applied to the list `a` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 18, and each element `a_i` in the list is an integer between 0 and 10^7.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
