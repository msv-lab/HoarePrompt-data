Output State: **`i` is 4; `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]` and the additional value `a[4] - a[3]`; `len(a)` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 4, the new value appended to `ad` is `a[4] - a[3]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
