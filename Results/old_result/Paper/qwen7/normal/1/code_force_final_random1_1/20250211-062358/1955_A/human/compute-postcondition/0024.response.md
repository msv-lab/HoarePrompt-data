Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value.
   - `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value.
   - `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(int(input()))`.
   - This means the loop will run for `int(input())` iterations.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Input for the Next Iteration**:
   - The next value of `i` (which is 2) will be used as the input to `int(input())` to determine how many more times the loop should run.
   - Let's denote this new input value as `new_input`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - The value of `new_input` will be determined by the user input but it does not need to be explicitly stated here since it is part of the loop condition.
   - The values of `t`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value, `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value, `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.**
