Output State: **The program returns the value of `l`, which is the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` where `c` is `c + 3`, `k` is `k - (n - 4) + 1`, and `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` if `k` equals 0.**

This means that the program first calculates the new value of `c` as `c + 3`, then updates `k` to `k - (n - 4) + 1`. After that, it calls `func_3(c, l)` and assigns its return value to `l`. Finally, it calls `func_2(c, k, l)` and returns its result.
