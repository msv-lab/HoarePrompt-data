Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b` in the range from `n - m` to `n - 1`; `i` is `n - 1`; for each `i` in the range from `n - m` to `n - 1`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `b_values = set(b)` creates a set from the list `b`, which contains only unique elements from the list `b`. Since the initial state mentions that `b_values` must contain at least one element, the set `b_values` now contains all unique elements from the specified range of `i` values (from `n - m` to `n - 1`).
- The variable `i` is updated to `n - 1` after the loop has completed its iterations.
- The variable `cnt_b` has been updated such that for each `i` in the range from `n - m` to `n - 1`, the count of `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.
