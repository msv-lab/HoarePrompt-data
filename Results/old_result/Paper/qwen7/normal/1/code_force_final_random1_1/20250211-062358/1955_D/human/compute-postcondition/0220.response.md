Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `b_values` must contain at least one element.
- `i` will be equal to `n - m`.
- `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop does not depend on any specific variables inside the loop body. Instead, it runs for a number of times specified by the user input. Therefore, the loop head does not involve any variables that change within the loop itself.

### State Adjustment
Since the loop does not modify any variables within its head (it only specifies the number of iterations), the state remains unchanged from the previous iteration. The only thing that changes is the number of iterations that will occur.

### Conclusion
Given that the loop simply runs a specified number of times based on user input, and no variables are modified within the loop head, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` will be equal to `n - m`, `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.**
