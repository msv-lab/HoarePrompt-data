Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t + 1`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in both `a` and `b` up to `k`, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The line `aOnes = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `aOnes`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
