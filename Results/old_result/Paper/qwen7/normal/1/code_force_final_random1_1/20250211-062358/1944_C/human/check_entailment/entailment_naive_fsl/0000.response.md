Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to find the smallest missing number in the array `c` by iterating through the numbers and checking if they are present in the `vis` set. However, the logic for updating the `start` variable and handling the transition from one number to the next is flawed.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
3
0 0 1 1
```

The correct output should be `2`, as explained in the example note. However, the provided program will output `1` instead. This happens because the program does not properly handle the transition from `0` to `1` and continues to check for `0` after finding it, which leads to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate the game and determine the MEX of the resulting array `c`. The current implementation does not accurately model the turns taken by Alice and Bob, and it fails to account for the optimal strategy for both players.
