Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the `range(n)` function.
   - The loop variable `i` itself is being modified within the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - Since `i` starts at `n - 1`, the loop will run until `i` reaches 0 (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be initialized to `n - 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is set to `n - 1` and `n` remains the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the list `l`**
