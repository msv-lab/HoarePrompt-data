Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (the starting point of the range).
   - `n` is an input integer between 2 and 24.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means:
- `i` should start from 1.
- `n` should be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 2 to allow the loop to run at least once).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` should be set to an integer value between 2 and 24 (inclusive).

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24**
