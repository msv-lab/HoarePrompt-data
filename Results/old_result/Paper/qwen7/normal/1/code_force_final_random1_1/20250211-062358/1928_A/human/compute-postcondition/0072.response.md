Output State: **t is 9999, `_` is 9998, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.**

In this final state after all iterations of the loop have executed, the value of `t` remains 9999 because the loop runs exactly `t` times, which is set to its maximum possible value within the given constraints (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). The variable `_` increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop, so after 9998 iterations, `_` is 9998. Since the loop processes each input pair `(a, b)` independently and does not modify `t` or `_` outside of the loop's conditions, `a` and `b` will retain their last input values after the loop completes all its iterations.
