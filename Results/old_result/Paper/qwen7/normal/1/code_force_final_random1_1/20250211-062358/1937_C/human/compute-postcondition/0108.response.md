Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n-1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is the new input provided by the user.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` is 3 (though `k` is not part of the loop head, it does not affect the loop continuation).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - If `res` equals '<', the condition remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `res` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `k` remains 3 (unchanged).

So, the final state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`res` is the new input provided by the user, `i` is 4, `k` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
