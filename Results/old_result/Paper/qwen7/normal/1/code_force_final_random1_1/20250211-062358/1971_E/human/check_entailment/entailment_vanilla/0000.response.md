Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`. It also correctly parses the positions `a` and times `b`.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and stores them in `ad` and `bd` respectively. This is correct.

3. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed between consecutive points using the formula `speed = distance / time` and stores these speeds in the list `v`. This is correct.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the query point `ql` lies. If `ql` exactly matches a known position in `a`, it directly outputs the corresponding time from `b`. Otherwise, it calculates the remaining distance within the identified segment and computes the total time taken to reach `ql`.

5. **Time Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the time taken to travel the remaining distance within the identified segment and adds this to the time taken to reach the previous known position. The result is then rounded down to the nearest integer.

6. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the results for each query in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
