Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the entire input string `s`.
- `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`.
- `cur` is 0.
- `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.
- `tmp` is 'd'.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'NO' without any dependency on the values of the other variables.

Output: **NO**
