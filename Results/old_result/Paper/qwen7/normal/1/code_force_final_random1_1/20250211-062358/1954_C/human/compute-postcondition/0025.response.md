Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`.
2. **Current state of variables**:
   - `i` is equal to `len(a) + 1`.
   - `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`.
   - `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`.
   - `new2[i]` is updated to be the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the current index `i`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop `while i < len(a)` to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Currently, `i` is set to `len(a) + 1`, which means the condition `i < len(a)` is false.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be less than `len(a)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, and `new2[i]` is updated to be the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the current index `i`.**
