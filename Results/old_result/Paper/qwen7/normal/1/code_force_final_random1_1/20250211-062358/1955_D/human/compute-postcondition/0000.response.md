Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000**.

Explanation: The code sets `max_val` to 1000000. This assignment updates the value of `max_val` but does not affect the value of `t`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `max_val` is explicitly set to 1000000.
