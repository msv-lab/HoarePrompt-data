Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `x - 1`
   - `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value
   - `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`
   - `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`
   - If `gap > 1` and `gap % 2 == 1`, then `odd` contains the value `gap`
   - Otherwise, if `gap > 0` and `gap % 2 == 0`, then `even` is `[gap]`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is `x - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `x`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `x`.
   - `x` remains unchanged because it is an upper bound and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` becomes `x`
   - `x` remains the same (greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value)
   - `next_elem` is now `a[i + 1] = a[x]`
   - `gap` is now `next_elem - a[i] - 1 = a[x] - a[x - 1] - 1`
   - Based on the new `gap`, update the values of `odd` and `even` accordingly.

Given this analysis, the updated states are:

- `i` is `x`
- `x` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value
- `next_elem` is `a[x]`
- `gap` is `a[x] - a[x - 1] - 1`
- If `gap > 1` and `gap % 2 == 1`, then `odd` contains the value `gap`
- Otherwise, if `gap > 0` and `gap % 2 == 0`, then `even` is `[gap]`

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[x]`, `gap` is `a[x] - a[x - 1] - 1`, and based on the new `gap`, `odd` and `even` are updated accordingly.**
