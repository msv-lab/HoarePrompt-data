Output State: **`current_year` is the new value of `next_year` from the previous iteration, `next_year` is equal to (current_year // ai + 1) * ai, `a` contains at least one element.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` based on the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. The value of `current_year` from the previous iteration is used, and `ai` is assumed to be an element from the list `a`. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and it is mentioned that `a` contains at least one element. The value of `current_year` becomes the new value of `next_year` after applying the given formula.
