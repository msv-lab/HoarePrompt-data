Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping int to the input split, `suf` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `suf`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `b`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
