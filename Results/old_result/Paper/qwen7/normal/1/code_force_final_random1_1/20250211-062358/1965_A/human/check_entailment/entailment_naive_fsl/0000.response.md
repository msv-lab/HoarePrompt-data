Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the fact that the game continues until all piles are empty, and it incorrectly determines the winner based on the initial conditions of the piles.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```

- Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

- Actual Output:
```
Bob
```

In this case, Alice can win by removing 1 stone from the third and fourth piles, making them empty. This leaves two piles of 1 stone each. Bob then has to remove 1 stone from both piles, leaving them empty. At this point, Alice cannot make a move and loses. However, the provided code incorrectly returns "Bob" as the winner.

The correct approach would involve simulating the game moves and checking if the current player can force a win. The provided solution does not simulate the game properly and instead relies on heuristics that do not guarantee correctness for all inputs.
