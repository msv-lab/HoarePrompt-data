Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of draws is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `(1, 1, 2)`, the program outputs `2` but the correct output should be `1`. This is because the maximum number of draws can be 1 (one draw between the first and third player, and the second player wins the game against the first player).
   - For the input `(1, 1, 10)`, the program outputs `2` but the correct output should be `-1`. This is because it's impossible to achieve a score of 10 for the third player while the first and second players have only 1 point each.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The current logic does not properly handle the constraints and edge cases. For instance, it incorrectly calculates the number of draws without fully validating the conditions under which the scores can be achieved.
   - The function `func_1` needs to ensure that the scores are achievable through a combination of wins, losses, and draws.

To fix this, you need to correctly implement the logic to check if the scores are achievable and calculate the maximum number of draws accurately. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        # Check if the total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Total matches played
        total_matches = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        
        # Check if the total matches are feasible
        if total_matches > 3 or p3 > total_matches:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the number of draws
        max_draws = 0
        for i in range(total_matches + 1):
            j = total_matches - i
            k = p3 - p2
            l = p3 - p1
            
            if i + j == total_matches and k >= 0 and l >= 0 and (i + j + k + l) == total_matches:
                max_draws = max(max_draws, i + j)
        
        resultats.append(max_draws)
    
    return resultats
```

This corrected function ensures that the scores are achievable and calculates the maximum number of draws accurately.
