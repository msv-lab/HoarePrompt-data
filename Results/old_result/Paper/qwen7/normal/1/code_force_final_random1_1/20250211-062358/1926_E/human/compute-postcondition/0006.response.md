Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` can be expressed as `n - m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
