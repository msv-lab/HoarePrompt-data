Output State: **`total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and greater than or equal to -1, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other conditions and variables (`best`, `na_frente`, `v`) remain unchanged as per the initial state. If `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` before the increment, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
