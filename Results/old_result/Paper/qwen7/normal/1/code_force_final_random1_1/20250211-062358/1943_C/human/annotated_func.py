#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `l` and returns the index of the maximum value within that list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3, u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and the structure of u2vs represents a valid tree.

    #State: All elements in the list `u2vs` will contain pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between indices. The final state of `u2vs` will be such that for every pair `(u, v)` entered through the loop, both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will contain each other.

        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, ..., -1]` (with `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates).
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to append `n` to `path_ba` until `n` equals `-1`. Since the condition for breaking the loop is `if n == -1`, and we know that the loop has executed at least 3 times and `n` is `-1` each time, it implies that `n` will continue to be `-1` in subsequent iterations as well. Therefore, `path_ba` will keep appending `-1` until the loop terminates, which happens when `n` finally becomes `-1` again, satisfying the loop's termination condition. Given that the loop has already executed 3 times and `n` is `-1` each time, it suggests that `n` will remain `-1` for all further iterations, making `path_ba` a list filled with `-1`s.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 1; `ci` is 1; `ops` is a list containing three tuples \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\].
        #
        #In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains unchanged at 1 because the loop's condition `i < ci + 1` evaluates to false when `i` reaches 2 (since `ci` is 1). The variable `ci` also remains unchanged at 1. The list `ops` contains three tuples, each being `(1, 1)`, as the loop appends the same tuple `(c, i)` for each iteration, and since `c` is 1 (the current value of `ci`), and `i` increments from 0 to 1, the list ends up with three identical tuples.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 6; `c1` is unchanged; `ops` now contains the tuples (`c1`, 3), (`c2`, 1), (`c2`, 3), (`c1`, 5), (`c2`, 5), (`c1`, 7), (`c2`, 7).
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs for as many iterations as there are elements in `path_ba` that satisfy the condition `1 <= i < len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2. Given that `path_ba` has an even length and considering the pattern from the first three iterations, we can deduce that the loop will continue until `i` reaches the second last element of `path_ba` (since the length of `path_ba` minus `c1` would be even and `i` increments by 2 each time). Since the loop executed 3 times up to `i` being 5, it will execute one more time with `i` becoming 7, adding the tuples (`c1`, 7) and (`c2`, 7) to `ops`.
    #State: `i` is either 1 or 6, `ci` is either 1 or unchanged, and `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `len(path_ba)` is odd, then `i` is 1, `ci` is 1, and `ops` is a list containing three tuples \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\]. Otherwise, `i` is 6, `ci` is unchanged, and `ops` contains the tuples \[(c1, 3), (c2, 1), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7)\], where `c1` and `c2` are the values they had before the loop.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: 3 or 7 (depending on whether len(path_ba) is odd or even)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: - If `i` is 1:
    #     - `ops` is \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\].
    #     - The lambda function applied to each tuple results in:

    #       - \((1, 1) \rightarrow f'{1 + 1} {1}' = '2 1'\)
    #       - \((1, 1) \rightarrow f'{1 + 1} {1}' = '2 1'\)
    #     - The output will be:

    #       - \((c2, 3) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {3}' = f'{c2 + 1} 3'\)

    #       - \((c2, 7) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {7}' = f'{c2 + 1} 7'\)
    #     - The output will be:
    #       ```
    #       {c1 + 1} 3
    #       {c2 + 1} 1
    #       {c2 + 1} 3

    #       {c1 + 1} 7
    #       {c2 + 1} 7
    #       ```
    #
    #Given that `i` is either 1 or 6, and since the problem does not specify which case applies, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the most precise answer based on the given conditions is:
    #
    #Output:
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs a tree represented by the list `u2vs` and performs a series of operations to determine and print a specific set of operations based on the tree structure. It reads an integer `n` and a tree structure from the input, performs breadth-first searches (BFS) to find certain nodes, and constructs a list of operations. Depending on the length of the resulting path, it either prints three tuples or a varying number of tuples. The function ultimately returns nothing.
