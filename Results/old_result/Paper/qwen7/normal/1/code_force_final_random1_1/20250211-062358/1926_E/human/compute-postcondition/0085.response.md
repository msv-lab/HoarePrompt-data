Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 4, `pow` is 4, `t` must be greater than 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The line `L = []` reassigns the variable `L` to an empty list. All other variables (`a`, `tot`, `pow`, `t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
