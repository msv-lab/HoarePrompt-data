You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list where all elements are equal and odd, the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `cnt` is the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2 after the loop has completed all its iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will be the total sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2. This is because the loop processes each element in the list `a` exactly once, adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt` for each element `x`. Since all elements in `a` are equal and odd, the value of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element will be either 0 or 1, contributing to the final value of `cnt`. The exact value of `cnt` depends on the specific values of the elements in `a`, but it will be the sum of these contributions after processing all elements in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of four non-negative integers p_i (representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence) where each p_i is between 0 and 200, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Based on these inputs, the function returns specific values or performs certain operations without modifying the input parameters directly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
