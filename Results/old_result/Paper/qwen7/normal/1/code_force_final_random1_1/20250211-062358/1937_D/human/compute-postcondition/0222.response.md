Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1), `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l]`**.

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `B[r - l]` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
