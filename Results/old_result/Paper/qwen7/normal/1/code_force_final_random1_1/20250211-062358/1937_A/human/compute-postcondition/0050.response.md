Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not affect the print statement directly.
2. **n_cases**: An input integer. Its value is not explicitly given, but it influences the value of `n`.
3. **i**: 
   - If `n` is 1, then `i` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `i` is 2.
4. **n**: 
   - If `n_cases` must be 1, then `n` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `n` is greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\).
5. **power**: 
   - If `n` is 1, then `power` is 4.
   - Otherwise, `power` is 8.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(1)
```

The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **1**
