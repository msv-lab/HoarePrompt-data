Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is the next line from the input.
   - `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int.
   - `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int.
   - The variables `n` and `k` have swapped their roles in terms of holding the split values of `s`.
   - If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, the condition holds as is.
   - Otherwise, `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, and the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each line of input starting from the second line (since `[*open(0)][1:]` skips the first line).

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over lines of input, the variable `s` will be updated to the next line.
   - The variables `n` and `k` will be updated based on the split values of the new line `s`.
   - The roles of `n` and `k` may swap depending on the condition `k <= 4 * n - 4`.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `s` will be the next line from the input.
- `n` and `k` will be updated based on the split values of `s`.
- If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, the condition remains the same.
- If `k > 4 * n - 4`, then `k` will be either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, and the roles of `n` and `k` will remain swapped.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`s` is the next line from the input, `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, and the variables `n` and `k` have swapped their roles in terms of holding the split values of `s`. If `k > 4 * n - 4`, then `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, and the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped.**
