Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) filled with 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the top-left and bottom-right cells of the grid are the same color. If they are different, it further checks if all cells in the first row and last column are the same color. Based on these checks, it determines whether the grid meets certain conditions and prints 'YES' if it does, otherwise 'NO'.**
