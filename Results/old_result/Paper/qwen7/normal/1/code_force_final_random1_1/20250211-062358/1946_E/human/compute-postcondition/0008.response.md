Output State: **The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)**

Given the initial state where `a` and `b` are positive integers, `a >= b`, `b != 0`, and `a` is divisible by `b`, the code snippet `return 1, -(a // b - 1)` will return two values:

1. The first value is `1`.
2. The second value is calculated as `-(a // b - 1)`. Since `a` is divisible by `b`, `a // b` will give the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`. Therefore, `a // b - 1` will be the quotient minus one. Taking the negative of this value gives us `- (quotient - 1)`, which simplifies to `1 - quotient`.

So, the program returns `1` and `1 - (a // b)`.
