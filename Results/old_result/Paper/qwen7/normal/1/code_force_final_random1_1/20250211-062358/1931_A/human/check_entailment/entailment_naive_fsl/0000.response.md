Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. 

For example, consider the encoded value `3`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"aaa"`. However, the program generates `"aaaz"` instead, which is not the lexicographically smallest word.

Here is a breakdown of the issue:
- When `n = 3`, the correct output should be `"aaa"`.
- The program incorrectly generates `"aaaz"`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it constructs the word in a way that guarantees the lexicographically smallest result for all possible encoded values.
