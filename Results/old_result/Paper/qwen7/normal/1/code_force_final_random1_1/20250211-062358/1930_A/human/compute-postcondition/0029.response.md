Output State: **`i` is 2 * `n` - 1, `score` is the original `score` plus the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (`n` - 1), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `i` is `2 * n - 1`, and the initial value of `score` is the original `score` plus the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (n - 1). These values remain unchanged except for `n`, which is updated to the input integer.
