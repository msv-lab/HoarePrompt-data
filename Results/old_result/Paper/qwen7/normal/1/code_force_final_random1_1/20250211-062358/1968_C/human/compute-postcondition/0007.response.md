Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The value of `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n-1 + 1 = n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2**
