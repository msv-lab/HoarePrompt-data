You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18, and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7 for all 1 <= i <= n. ops is a list used to store the operations performed during the process.
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be `r + 1`, `l` remains the first element of `ops`, `r` remains the second element of `ops`, and `a[i]` is `r - l + 1`.
        #
        #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the next index after `r` (which is `r + 1`), while `l` and `r` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. All elements from index `l` to index `r` in list `a` will be set to the value `r - l + 1`.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: Postcondition: `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` is called.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: Postcondition: `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.
    #State: `s` is the sum of elements from index `l` to index `r` inclusive in list `a`. If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then `i` will be `r + 1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and all elements from index `l` to index `r` in list `a` will be set to the value `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `l` containing non-negative integers and a list `r` to store operations. It returns the maximum possible sum achievable by performing operations on the elements of `l` as specified in `r`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
