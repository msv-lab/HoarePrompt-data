Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` and `sb` are both lists containing all integers from 6 to `n`. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `nx` is a string of length `n` composed entirely of 'F' characters. Otherwise, `nx` is a string of length `n` consisting entirely of 'S' characters.**
