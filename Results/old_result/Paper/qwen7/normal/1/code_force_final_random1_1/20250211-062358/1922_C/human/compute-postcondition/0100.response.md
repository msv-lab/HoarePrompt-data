Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d1[n + 1]` is the sum of `d1[2]` (which is 1) and the number of times the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] >= l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-2`, plus the cumulative differences `l[i + 1] - l[i]` when the condition does not hold, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` for each `i` from `n-2` down to 0.**

This means that the value of `d2[i]` for each `i` from `n-2` down to 0 has been updated according to the formula `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
