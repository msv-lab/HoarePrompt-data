Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `x // i`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

4. **Check the loop continuation condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k` before, it will become `k + 1`.
   - `x` remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it, but since no such update is mentioned, `x` stays the same.

6. **Ensure the loop condition is met**:
   - After incrementing `i`, `i` should still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `x` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `ans` remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it, but since no such update is mentioned, `ans` stays the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `x // i`. `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.**
