Output State: **`n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `k` is the third integer input by the user, and all values in `cnt_b` are 0.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now specific integers based on the user's input. Since the initial state of all values in `cnt_b` being 0 is a precondition and no operation changes these values, `cnt_b` remains unchanged.
