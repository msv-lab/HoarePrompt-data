Output State: **`pk` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, `final` is a list containing 0, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list `final`. The list `final` was initially empty, so after appending `0`, it now contains `[0]`. The values of `pk`, `mini`, and `c1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
