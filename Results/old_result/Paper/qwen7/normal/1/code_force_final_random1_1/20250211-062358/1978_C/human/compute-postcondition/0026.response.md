Output State: **The program returns the value of 'l', which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is `c + 3` and `l` is the initial value of `i` adjusted by the function `func_3`.**

To break it down:
- The initial state gives us that `i = n - 4`.
- `k` is updated to `k - (n - 4) + 1`.
- `c` is updated to `c + 3`.
- `l` is set to the return value of the function `func_3(c, l)`.
- Finally, the code returns `l`.

Since we don't know the exact implementation of `func_3`, we can only describe `l` as the return value of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is `c + 3` and `l` is the initial value of `i` adjusted by the function `func_3`.
