Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning it runs `n` times.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is a string composed of 'S' and 'F' based on certain conditions.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` but does not include `n + 1` itself.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each time, after `n` iterations, `i` is `n`.
   - To start the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 1`.
   - `j` is already `n + 1`, so no change is needed here.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `nx` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `j` is still `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`nx` is a string composed of 'S' and 'F' based on the conditions provided, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`**.
