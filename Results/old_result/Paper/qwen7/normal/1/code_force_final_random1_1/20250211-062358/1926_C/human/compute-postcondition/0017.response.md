Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in str(i):` statement. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is a character in the string representation of `i`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is "400002"
   - `j` is "4"
   - `pd['400002']` is `int('400002') + 4`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is "4" (the first character of `str(i)`), the loop will continue if there are more characters in `str(i)`.
   - After the current iteration, `j` will be the next character in `str(i)`, which is "0".
   - Therefore, `i` remains "400002" because it hasn't changed yet.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` remains "400002".
   - `j` changes to "0".

6. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`, so we update these values accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is "400002", `j` is "0"`**
