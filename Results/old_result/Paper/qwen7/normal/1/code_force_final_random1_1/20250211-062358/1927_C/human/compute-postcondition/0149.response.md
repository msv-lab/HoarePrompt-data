Output State: **`bOnes` is 0, `t` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `aOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `bOnes = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `bOnes`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `aOnes` remain unchanged from their initial states.
