Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` remains the same, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 4, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s` plus the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` concatenates the value of `ss` to the end of `ans`. Initially, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s`. After adding `ss` (the third character of `s`) to `ans`, `ans` becomes the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s` plus the third character of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
