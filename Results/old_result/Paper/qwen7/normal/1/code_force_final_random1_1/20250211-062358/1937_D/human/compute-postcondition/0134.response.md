Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`, and the current value of `l - r - 1` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` from `A[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
