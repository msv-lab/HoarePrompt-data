Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is within the range 2 to \( n \).
   - \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24.
   - `nx` is updated based on certain conditions involving `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, and it was within the range 2 to \( n \) at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be \( j + 1 \).
   - Therefore, `j` will be \( j + 1 \) at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Maintain the Other Conditions**:
   - \( n \) remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - The condition for updating `nx` based on the values of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j` still holds for the new value of `j`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `j` will be \( j + 1 \).
- \( n \) remains the same.
- The conditions for updating `nx` based on the values of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j` remain valid.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is within the range 3 to \( n \), \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` is either incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', 'S' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**
