### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. Sorting the array and taking the difference between the maximum and minimum values does not necessarily achieve this. Instead, we need to strategically arrange the elements to maximize the sum of the differences.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program:
```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
- Sorts the array.
- Prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function processes multiple test cases, sorting the array and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This does not align with the required strategy to maximize the beauty of the array.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
3
100 54 80 43 90
```
- The program sorts the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
- It then calculates and prints `100 - 43 = 57`.

However, the correct approach involves rearranging the array to maximize the sum of differences. For instance, the optimal arrangement could be `[90, 43, 100, 54, 80]`, which gives a beauty of:
\[ (90 - 43) + (100 - 90) + (54 - 100) + (80 - 54) = 47 + 10 - 46 + 26 = 57 \]

This shows that simply sorting the array and taking the difference between the maximum and minimum values does not always yield the maximum beauty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum values after sorting, rather than strategically arranging the elements to maximize the sum of differences.

**Final: False**
