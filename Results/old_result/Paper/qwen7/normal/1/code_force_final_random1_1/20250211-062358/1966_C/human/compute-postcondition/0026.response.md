Output State: **`dp` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or not the previous value of `dp`; `i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp` to be `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the current `dp` value. Given that `i` is initially 2, after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The value of `dp` is now `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or not the previous value of `dp`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
