Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases. For each test case, `j` will be equal to `l`; `l` must be a positive integer; `ans` will be a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by the condition `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` ranging from `0` to `l-1`. The variable `array` will hold the list of integers input for that test case, `alp` will be the list of alphabets from 'a' to 'z', and `rev_array` will be the reversed version of `array`. The final output will be a string formed by joining the elements of `ans` and printing it for each test case.
