Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [0], `k` is less than or equal to `tot` + 2, `pow` is multiplied by 2, `tot` is `tot` + 0**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments `tot` by the value of `a`. Given that `a` is 0, `tot` remains unchanged. All other variables (`L`, `k`, and `pow`) remain in their initial states as no changes were made to them in the provided code.
