### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\),
     - \(1 \le b \le m\),
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code includes several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.), but none of these functions directly solve the problem.
   - The only function that might be relevant is `func_15`, which calculates a value related to the problem but does not seem to solve the core problem.

3. **Relevant Function: `func_15`:**
   - `func_15` calculates a value based on the formula: \( \text{ans} = \sum_{i=2}^{n+1} \left\lfloor \frac{n+i}{i^2} \right\rfloor \).
   - This formula does not directly address the problem statement. It seems to be a part of a different algorithm or calculation.

4. **Main Function: `func_16`:**
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_15` \( t \) times.
   - Since `func_15` does not solve the problem, `func_16` also does not solve the problem.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem. It includes utility functions but lacks the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the required functionality to solve the given problem.

**Final: False**
