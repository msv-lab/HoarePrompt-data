Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is either greater than `x` or undefined, `ind` contains the value 0, and `c` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
