Reasoning:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The program correctly iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Parsing**: Each test case is correctly parsed into integers `a` and `b`.
3. **Conditions Check**:
   - The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If true, it prints 'yes', which is correct because an even-sized rectangle can always be divided into smaller rectangles that can form a larger rectangle.
   - The second condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is equal to the negative of either `a` or `b`. This condition is redundant and incorrect. It should be checking if `a` and `b` are consecutive integers (i.e., one is the other plus one), in which case it should print 'no' because no further rectangle can be formed without changing the dimensions.
   - The third condition is incorrect and redundant. It incorrectly checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd or negative, which doesn't make sense in the context of forming a new rectangle.
   - The fourth condition, which is the default case, should handle all other scenarios. However, due to the incorrect conditions above, this part might not be necessary and could lead to incorrect results.

Given the logic errors in the conditions, the program does not accurately determine whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given dimensions.

Correctness: **False**
