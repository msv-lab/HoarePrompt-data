Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nxt` to be a tuple representing the new position based on the current position `pos` and the movement defined in `mov` for the command `com`. The values of `command`, `obj`, `com`, and `pos` remain unchanged.
