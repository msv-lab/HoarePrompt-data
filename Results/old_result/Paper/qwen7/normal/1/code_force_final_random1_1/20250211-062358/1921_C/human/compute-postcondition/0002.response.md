Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `feat` by taking input from the user, splitting the input string by spaces, and converting each element to an integer. The original values of `test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged. The new list `feat` contains the integers obtained from the input.
