Reasoning:
- The program aims to calculate the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur by sequentially adding the periodicities of the signs.
- For each test case, the program correctly initializes the `year` variable to 0.
- In the loop, it iterates through the list of periodicities `a`. For each periodicity `ai`, it updates `year` by adding `year % ai or ai` to it.
  - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so we add `ai` to `year`.
  - Otherwise, it adds `year % ai` to `year`, effectively moving `year` to the next multiple of `ai`.
- This logic ensures that `year` is always the smallest year where the current sign (and all previous signs) have occurred.
- The program prints the final value of `year` for each test case, which should be the correct year for the nth sign to occur.
- The execution summary aligns with this logic, confirming that the program processes each test case correctly and prints the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
