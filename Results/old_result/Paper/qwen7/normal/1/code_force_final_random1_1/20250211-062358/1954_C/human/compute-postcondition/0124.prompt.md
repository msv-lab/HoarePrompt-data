Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    if i != len(a):
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations; `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations, and `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list containing the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, and `new2` is a list containing the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`; `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
