Output State: **`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `distance` is 1, `rest` is not 0, and `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`**.

Explanation: The variable `delta` is assigned the value of the minimum between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The values of `distance`, `rest`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial states.
