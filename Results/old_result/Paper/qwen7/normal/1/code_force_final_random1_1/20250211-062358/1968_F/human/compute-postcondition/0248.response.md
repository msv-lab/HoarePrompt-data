Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 20, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`**

Explanation: The code snippet reassigns the value of `l` to `int(data[idx])`. The value of `idx` was previously increased by 20, and `l` was reassigned to `int(data[idx])`. The value of `q` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned to be a positive integer and will be `q - 1`.
