    #To explain this output state in natural language:
    #After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be set to `-1` because the loop runs in reverse from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. The variable `tem` will hold the product of all elements in the list `arr`, as it multiplies each element of `arr` in sequence during the loop.
