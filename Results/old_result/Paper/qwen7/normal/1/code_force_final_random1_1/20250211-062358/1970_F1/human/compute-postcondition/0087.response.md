Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop range is defined by `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ind` will be equal to `len(line)`.
   - `i` will still be 0.
   - `n` will remain an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive.
   - `line` will be a list of strings read from `stdin`.
   - `grid` will be a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`.
   - `elements` will be a dictionary where for every non-`.` character in `line`, the key is the character and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in `line`.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` will be `False`.
   - If `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) will contain tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop variable is `i` and it starts from 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as per the given conditions.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - `n` remains the same, so `n` is still an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive.

5. **Construct the New State:**
   - `ind` will still be `len(line)`.
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` will remain an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive.
   - `line` remains the same.
   - `grid` remains the same.
   - `elements` remains the same.
   - `allPlayers` and `goal` remain the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`ind` is `len(line)`, `i` is 1, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary where for every non-`.` character in `line`, the key is the character and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in `line`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` will be `False`, and if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) will contain tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`.**
