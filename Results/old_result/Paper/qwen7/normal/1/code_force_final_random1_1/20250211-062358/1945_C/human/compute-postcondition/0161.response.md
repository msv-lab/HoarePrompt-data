Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, `final` is either `[0]` or `[n]` depending on whether `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, and `t` is `t - 1`; `pk` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. The values of `mini`, `final`, `t`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
