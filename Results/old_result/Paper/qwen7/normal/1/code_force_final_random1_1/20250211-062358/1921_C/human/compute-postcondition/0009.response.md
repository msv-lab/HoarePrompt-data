Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is given as 0.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `feat`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.

4. **Check the initial value of `i`**: Since `i` is initially 0, it does not satisfy the loop condition `1 <= i < n`.

5. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be set to 1 (the starting point of the loop) and `n` must be greater than 1 (so that there is at least one iteration).

6. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `feat` is a list of integers, and its first element is `n`.
   - `f` is the second element of the list `feat`.
   - `a` is the third element of the list `feat`.
   - `b` is the last element of the list `feat`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `array2` is an empty list.

Since these other states do not affect the loop execution directly, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
