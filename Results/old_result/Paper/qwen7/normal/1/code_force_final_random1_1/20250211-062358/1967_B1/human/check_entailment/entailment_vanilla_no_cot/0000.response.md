Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The program attempts to incrementally calculate the number of valid pairs by iterating through values of \(b\) and then determining how many values of \(a\) satisfy the condition. However, the logic inside the loop is not correctly implementing the necessary checks.

2. **GCD and Multiples Check**: The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not properly handle this check.

3. **Incremental Counting**: The variable `count` is used to iterate through possible values of \(b\), but the logic for updating `ans` (which should represent the count of valid pairs) is not aligned with the problem requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
- For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
- Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of pairs that satisfy this condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, min(m + 1, a + 1)):  # b should be less than or equal to a
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This version correctly iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition for each pair, ensuring the solution is accurate.
