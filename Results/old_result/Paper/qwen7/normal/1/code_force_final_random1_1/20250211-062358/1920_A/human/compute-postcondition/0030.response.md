Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `v` to the variable `start`. No other changes are made to the existing variables, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
