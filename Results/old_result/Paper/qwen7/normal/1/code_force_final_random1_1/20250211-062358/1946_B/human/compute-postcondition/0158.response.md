Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, and `smin[i]` is the suffix minimum at index `i + 1` and now `smin` has an additional element which is `suf[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Since `smin[i]` was the suffix minimum at index `i` and `i + 1`, after appending, `smin` now contains an additional element which is `suf[i + 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the existing elements of `smin` remain unchanged.
