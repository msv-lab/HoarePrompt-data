Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `d1[5]` is 1 + `d1[4]`**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is `3 + 2` or `5`) is assigned the value `1 + d1[i + 1]` (which is `1 + d1[4]`). The initial conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
