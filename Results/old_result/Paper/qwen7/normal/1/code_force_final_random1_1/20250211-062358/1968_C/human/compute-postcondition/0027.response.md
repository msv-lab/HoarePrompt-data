Based on the initial state described, the list `a` will be transformed such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will hold the sum of the first `i` elements from the list `x`. Given the example provided, the final state of `a` will be `[1000, 110, 130, 160, 200]`.

To break it down:
- `a[1] = 1000 + x[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1010 + 20 = 1030`
- `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 1030 + 30 = 1060`
- `a[4] = a[3] + x[3] = 1060 + 40 = 1100`

However, the initial state specifies that the first element of `a` is `1000`, and the subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the first `i` elements of `x`.

Therefore, the final state of `a` is `[1000, 110, 130, 160, 200]`.

Output: **1000 110 130 160 200**
