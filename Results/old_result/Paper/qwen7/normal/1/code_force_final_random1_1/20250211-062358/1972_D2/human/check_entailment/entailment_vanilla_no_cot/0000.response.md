Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Conditions**: The program checks if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b` but it does not properly validate this condition. Specifically, the logic inside the `while` loops and the use of `min` and `//` operations do not correctly implement the required condition.

2. **GCD Check**: The program checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, which is not relevant to the problem statement. The problem requires checking if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`, not just if `gcd(a, b) == 1`.

3. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions and the way the counts are accumulated do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The current implementation does not ensure that the pairs `(a, b)` satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

To fix these issues, the program should be revised to properly check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` for each pair `(a, b)` within the specified ranges. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and checks if they satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.
