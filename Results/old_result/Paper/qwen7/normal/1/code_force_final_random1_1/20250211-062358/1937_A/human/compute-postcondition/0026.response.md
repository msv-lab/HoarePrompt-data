The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The input is an integer, and since `n_cases` is an input integer, `n` will take the value of `n_cases`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `power`) are not directly affected by this line of code, but their initial conditions remain valid.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is 1 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `n_cases` must be greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\). After the code runs, `n` will be the value of `n_cases`.
- `power` is 4 if `power` equals `n`, otherwise `power` is 3. Since `power` is initially 3 and `n` (which is now `n_cases`) does not equal 4, `power` remains 3.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is the value of `n_cases`, and `power` is 3.**
