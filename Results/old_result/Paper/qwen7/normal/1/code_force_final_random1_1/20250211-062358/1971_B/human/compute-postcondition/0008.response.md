Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a string which is the sorted version of `s`.**

The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the characters in the string `s` and joins them into a new string `b`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
