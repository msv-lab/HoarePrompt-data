Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`, and `end` is equal to `v`.**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `t` and the second integer to `v`. It does not affect the values of `i`, `num`, `start`, or `end`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `num`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged, while `t` and `v` are updated to the respective integers from the input.
