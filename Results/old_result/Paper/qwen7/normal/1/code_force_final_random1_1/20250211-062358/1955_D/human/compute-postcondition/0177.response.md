Postcondition: `i` is in the range [0, n - m - 1], `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains within the specified range, `a` and `b_values` remain unchanged, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` reaches or exceeds `k`.
