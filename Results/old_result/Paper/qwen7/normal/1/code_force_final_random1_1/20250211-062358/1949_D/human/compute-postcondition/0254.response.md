Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` remains the same, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, `nx` is either `'FF'` if either `i` or 3 is in the first quarter of `sa`, or a string with an additional 'S' appended to it otherwise, and `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][3]`**.

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by appending the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given that `j` is now 4, `j - 1` equals 3. Therefore, `nx` is updated to include `xx[i][3]`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `xx[i][0]`, and the condition for `nx`) remain unchanged.
