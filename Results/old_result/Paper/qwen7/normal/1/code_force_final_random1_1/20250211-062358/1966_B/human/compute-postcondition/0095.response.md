Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `impossible` is set to `False`, while all other variables retain their initial states. The conditions related to the list `gr` and the other variables remain unchanged.
