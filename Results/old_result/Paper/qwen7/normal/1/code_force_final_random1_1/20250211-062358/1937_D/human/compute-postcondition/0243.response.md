Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and depending on the value of `s[i]`:
- If `s[i] == '>'`, then `l` is increased by 1, `r` remains unchanged, and `b` is updated according to the specified formulae.
- If `s[i] != '>'`, then `r` is decreased by 1, and `b` is updated based on the value of `r` and the relationship between `l` and `r`. Specifically:
  - If `r` becomes 0, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)` and `b` is not defined.
  - If `r` is not 0, `a` is not defined and `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - l - 1] - (idx_B[r - l - 1] - 2) * (r - l - 1)`.
  - If `r` is not 0 and `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is further updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
