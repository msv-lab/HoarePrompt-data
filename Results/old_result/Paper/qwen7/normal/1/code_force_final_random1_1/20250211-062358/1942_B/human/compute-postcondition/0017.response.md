Output State: **`mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[len(ar) - 4]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 4`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, and `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 4`. The value of `mex` was originally `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, so now it becomes `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[len(ar) - 4]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
