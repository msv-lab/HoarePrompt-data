The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `b` is not zero. If `b` is zero, the function returns 1, 0, and `a`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and returns the results of this recursive call adjusted according to the Euclidean algorithm. The function ultimately returns values that satisfy the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
