Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if it is greater than or equal to 0, and `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is now greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
