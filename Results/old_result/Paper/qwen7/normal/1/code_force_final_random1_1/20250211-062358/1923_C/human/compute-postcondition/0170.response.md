Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- `a` is then updated to an input integer
- `b` is updated to an input integer
- `s` is then updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
