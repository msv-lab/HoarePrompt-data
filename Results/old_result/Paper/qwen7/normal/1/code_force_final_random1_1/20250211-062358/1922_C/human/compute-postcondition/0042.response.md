Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n-2` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d2` and `d1` remain unchanged.
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Analyze what happens in the loop body**:
   - The loop body updates `d2[i]` based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`.
   - If the condition is true, `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n-2` and decreases by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1`, which means `i` will be `0`.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be `0` in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is still at least 3.
   - `d2` and `d1` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`d2` and `d1` remain unchanged, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 0**.
