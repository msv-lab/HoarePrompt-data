Output State: **`countmins` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 3) / 3) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 3)` and `count` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
