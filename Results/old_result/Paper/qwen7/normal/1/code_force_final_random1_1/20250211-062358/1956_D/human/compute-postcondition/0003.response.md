Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `s` is the sum of elements in `a`.
- `m` is the maximum element in `a`.
- `ops` is the number of operations performed during the computation of `s` and `m`.

The `print(s, m)` statement will print the sum of the elements in the list `a` and the maximum element in the list `a`.

Since the exact values of the elements in the list `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `s` and `m`. However, we know that `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `m` is the largest value among these elements.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **s (the sum of elements in list a), m (the maximum element in list a)**
