The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases, then for each sub-case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) positive integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). It calculates a value `year` by iterating through the list \( a \) and updating `year` based on the current element. Finally, it prints the calculated `year` for each sub-case. After processing all test cases, the list `a` is empty, and the variable `year` holds the cumulative sum of all elements from the original lists across all sub-cases.
