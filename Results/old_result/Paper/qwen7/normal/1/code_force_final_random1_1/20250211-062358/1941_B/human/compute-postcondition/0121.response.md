Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `stop` is `True`
   - `i` is `4`
   - `opNum` is `a[3]`
   - `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`
   - `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`
   - `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - 2 * opNum - opNum - opNum`
   - `numTest` is `numTest - 1`
   - `a[3]` is `a[3] - opNum`
   - `a[4]` is `a[4] - 2 * opNum`
   - `a[6]` is `a[6] - opNum`

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < n - 2`.
   - Currently, `i` is `4`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `6` (since `4 < n - 2` implies `n > 6`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from `4` to `5`.
   - `n` must remain such that `i < n - 2` still holds true.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `stop` remains `True` (it is not affected by the loop head).
- `i` becomes `5`.
- `n` must be greater than `6`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `5`, `n` must be greater than `6`**
