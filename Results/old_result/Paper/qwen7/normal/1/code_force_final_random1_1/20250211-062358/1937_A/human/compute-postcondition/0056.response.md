Output State: **`power` is increased by 1 and is now less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `power` is increased by 1 and must be less than `n`, after executing the code, `power` is now increased by another 1 and still needs to be less than `n`.
