Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'NO'; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` (or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep the list sorted) - 1.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the `results` list, changing its content from possibly containing `'YES'` to now containing `'NO'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
