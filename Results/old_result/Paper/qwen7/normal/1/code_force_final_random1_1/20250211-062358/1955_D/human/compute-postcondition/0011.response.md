Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `max_val` is 1000000.
   - `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with the element at index `b[1]` incremented by 1.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `m` is at least 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be at least 1 (it could be greater than 1, but it must be non-zero).

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `max_val` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `cnt_b` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `b` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented to 4.
   - `m` must remain at least 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with the element at index `b[1]` incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 4, `m` is at least 1**
