You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers such that k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, and a_k = n. b is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1. d is a list of q integers where 0 ≤ d ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ad = [0]

        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
        
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
        
        v = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
        
        for l in range(q):
            m = 0
            i = 1
            ql = int(input())
            s = bisect_left(a, ql)
            if a[s] == ql:
                print(b[s], end=' ')
                continue
            ql -= a[s - 1]
            m += b[s - 1]
            m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
            print(int(m), end=' ')
        
        print()
        
    #State: Output State: All the variables `i`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, and `s` will reflect their final values after the loop has completed all its iterations. Specifically:
    #
    #- `i` will be `len(a) + 1`, as it starts from 1 and increments with each iteration until it reaches the length of `a`.
    #- `l` will be `q + (len(a) - 1)`, indicating the total number of queries processed across all test cases.
    #- `m` will be the cumulative sum of interpolated values calculated for each query within the context of the last test case.
    #- `ql` will be the final input integer reduced by the cumulative sum of elements in `a` up to the point where the last query was satisfied.
    #- `s` will be the index determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)` for the last query processed.
    #
    #This state reflects the completion of the loop after processing all test cases and queries, with all relevant variables updated to their final values based on the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters t, n, k, q, a, b, and d. t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. n, k, and q are integers with k ≤ n, 1 ≤ k and q ≤ 10^5, and the sum of k and q does not exceed 10^5 across all test cases. a is a list of k integers sorted in ascending order, each between 1 and n. b is a list of k integers sorted in ascending order, each between 1 and 10^9. d is a list of q integers, each between 0 and n. The function returns a value based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
