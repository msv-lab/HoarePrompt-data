Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer provided by the user, `m` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `countmins` is equal to `m`, `g` is 0, and `ans` is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the contributions from each iteration of the loop for all `i` from 0 to `t - 1`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the following will be true:
    #- `count` will be `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` until it exceeds `m`.
    #- `i` will be `t - 1` because the loop iterates `t` times, and `i` is the loop counter.
    #- `n` will remain the input integer provided by the user.
    #- `m` will remain the input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4.
    #- `countmins` will be `m` because it is initialized as `count - 1` and `count` becomes `m + 1` at the end of the loop.
    #- `g` will be 0 because the loop breaks when `g` becomes less than `countmins`.
    #- `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the series where each term is `int(int(n / i) / i) + 1` for `i` ranging from 2 to `m`, inclusive, for all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a result based on \( n \) and updates it according to a specific formula involving \( m \). The function prints the final result for each test case. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the sum of \( n \) and \( m \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^6 \).
