Output State: **`B` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, and `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.**

The code initializes an empty list `B`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `A`, or `idx_A`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
