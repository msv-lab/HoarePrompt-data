Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `k` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 4, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `0` is a literal integer.
- `k` is 3.
- `0` is another literal integer.
- `i` is 4.

So, the print statement will output these values in the order they are specified.

Output: **'? 0 3 0 4'**
