Based on the initial state provided:

- The final value of `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's across all input strings provided during the loop executions.
- The first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.

Given this information, we know that the list `k` has at least two elements, and these two elements are equal. However, the specific value of these elements is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact number of '1's counted.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'SQUARE'`.

Output: **SQUARE**
