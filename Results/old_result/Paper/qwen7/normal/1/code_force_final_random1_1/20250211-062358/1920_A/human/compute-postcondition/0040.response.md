Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing [second integer from the input], `start` is equal to `v`, and `end` is equal to `v`.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `num` initially contains only the second integer from the input (as specified by the precondition), appending `v` to `num` results in `num` now containing a list with one element, which is the second integer from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
