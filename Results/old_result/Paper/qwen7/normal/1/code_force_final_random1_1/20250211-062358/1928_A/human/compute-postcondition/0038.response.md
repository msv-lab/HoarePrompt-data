Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and `i` equals the total number of test cases (`t`). The loop processes each test case, and based on the conditions provided, it prints 'yes' or 'no'.**

In simpler terms, after running through all iterations of the loop, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 10,000, `a` and `b` are the last integers input for the final test case, and `i` will be equal to `t`, indicating that all `t` test cases have been processed. The loop's output ('yes' or 'no') for each test case is determined by the given conditions, but the specific values of `a` and `b` will be those of the last test case since they are updated with each iteration.
