Based on the initial state provided, `custos` must contain at least one element. However, the specific value or type of `custos` is not explicitly stated. Since the print statement only references `c`, and there is no definition or assignment for `c` in the given information, we cannot determine the value of `c`.

Given the lack of information about `c`, the most precise description we can provide is that `c` is some unspecified value from `custos`.

Output: **c (where c is an unspecified element from custos)**
