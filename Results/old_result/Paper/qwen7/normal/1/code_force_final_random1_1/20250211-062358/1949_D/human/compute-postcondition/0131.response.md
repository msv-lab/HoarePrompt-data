Output State: **`i` is 7, `n` is an integer between 7 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing the integers 6 and 7, `sb` is a list containing the integer 6.**

The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 7, to the list `sa`. Initially, `sa` contains the integer 6. After appending, `sa` will contain the integers 6 and 7. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `sb` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
