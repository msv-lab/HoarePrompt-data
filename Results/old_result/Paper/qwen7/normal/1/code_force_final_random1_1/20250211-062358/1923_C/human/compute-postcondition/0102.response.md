Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]` does not change the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, or `s`. It only updates the value of `i` to be the difference between `c[b]` and `c[a - 1]`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
