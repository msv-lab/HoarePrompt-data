Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n - m - 1` (inclusive).
   - The loop condition is `i < n - m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n - m` must be at least 1.
   - `a[i]` (or `a[i + m]` if the condition is true) is an element in the set `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` is adjusted based on the value of `a[i + m]` (or `a[i]`).
   - If `a[i + m]` (or `a[i]`) is in `b_values` and was greater than 0, it is decremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n - m - 1`, if `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - If `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - The condition `n - m` must still be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Update the states accordingly:**
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `n - m` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `a[i]` (or `a[i + m]` if the condition is true) will be checked for the new value of `i`.
   - The adjustments to `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `curr` will depend on the new value of `a[i + m]` (or `a[i]`), but these are not part of the loop head and thus not adjusted here.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
- `n - m` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 1 (if it was 0 previously), `i` is 2 (if it was 1 previously), `n - m` must be at least 1.**

To provide a specific example, if `i` was 0 previously:

**State: `i` is 1, `n - m` must be at least 1.**

If `i` was 1 previously:

**State: `i` is 2, `n - m` must be at least 1.**
