Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`; `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**

The code `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. This means that the condition used to determine the value of `d2[i]` in the initial state no longer applies since `d2[i]` has been explicitly set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially `n - 4`.
