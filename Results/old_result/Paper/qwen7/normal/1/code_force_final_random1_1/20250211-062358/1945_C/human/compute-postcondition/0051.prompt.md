Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All indices `i` in the range of `n-1` have been iterated over, so `i` will be equal to `n-1`. `zero` will be the total count of '0's in the string `s`, and `one` will be the total count of '1's in the string `s`. `zero_perc` will be `zero * 100 // n` and `one_perc` will be `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n-1) - 1)` or simplified as `(o - one) * 100 // 0`, which will result in an error due to division by zero. However, assuming no division by zero occurs, `zero_perc` will be `zero * 100 // n` and `one_perc` will be `(o - one) * 100 // (n - n + 1)` or `o - one * 100`. `lst` will contain all indices `i + 1` where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop iterations.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, where `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `lst` is the same list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
