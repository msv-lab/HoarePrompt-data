Postcondition: `b` is the new input string provided by the user, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b` plus one, and `int(input())` is a positive integer. If the string `b` contains the character '1', then `k` is updated to reflect the count of '1' in `b` plus one. If '1' is not in `b`, `k` remains unchanged.
