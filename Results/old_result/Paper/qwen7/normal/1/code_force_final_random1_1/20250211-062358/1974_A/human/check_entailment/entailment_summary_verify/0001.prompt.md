You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\), calculates a value \(z\) based on these inputs and an adjustment factor, and prints the final value of \(z\). The function iterates through all test cases and adjusts \(z\) if necessary based on the comparison between \(m\) and \(a\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on a grid where each screen is a 5x3 grid.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - The total number of cells available per screen is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`.
   - It calculates the number of screens required using the formula:
     - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This calculates the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit, rounded up.
     - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
     - If `m < x`, it means there are not enough remaining cells to place all 1x1 icons, so additional screens are needed. The additional screens are calculated as `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to correctly account for the placement of 2x2 icons first and then filling the remaining space with 1x1 icons.
   - The calculation of additional screens when `m < x` ensures that all 1x1 icons are placed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where there might not be enough space left for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.
   - It correctly increments the number of screens needed when necessary.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected output from the given code.

### Conclusion:
The given code appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
