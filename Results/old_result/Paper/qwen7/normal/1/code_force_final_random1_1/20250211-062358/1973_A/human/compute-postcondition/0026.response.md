Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `resultats` is a list with an additional element `-1`.**

Explanation: The code `total_matchs = total_points // 2` calculates the integer division of `total_points` by 2 and assigns the result to `total_matchs`. The other variables (`cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, and `resultats`) remain unchanged.
