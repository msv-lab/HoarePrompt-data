Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the value of `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - Based on the postcondition, if `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is 'zz'. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 26, then `word` is 'az'. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, then `word` is 'aaa'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` (which will be 2) must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2.
- The value of `word` remains unchanged based on the current value of `n`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `word` is determined based on the current value of `n`**.
