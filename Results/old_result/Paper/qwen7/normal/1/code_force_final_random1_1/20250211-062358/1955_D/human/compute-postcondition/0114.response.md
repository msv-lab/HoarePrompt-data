Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since the indices and elements of `b` are not specified, the only thing we can conclude is that `cnt_b` now contains counts of the elements in `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
