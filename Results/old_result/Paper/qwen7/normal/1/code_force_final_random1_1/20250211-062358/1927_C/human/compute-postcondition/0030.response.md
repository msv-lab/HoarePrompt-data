Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `aOnes` is either 1 or 0, `newk` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0.
