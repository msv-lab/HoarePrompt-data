Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', and `l` is less than `r`; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - ((idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1))`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from the current value of `b`. Since the initial value of `b` was `B[r - 1] - B[x]`, the new value of `b` becomes `B[r - 1] - B[x] - ((idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1))`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
