Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to fill in the undecided transition videos (`?`) in such a way that no matter the order of scenarios, no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type appear. The program should also respect the pre-decided transition videos (`F` or `S`).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code initializes two arrays `a` and `b` to count the number of `F` and `S` transitions for each scenario.
   - It reads the input and updates these counts.
   - It then categorizes scenarios into two lists `sa` and `sb` based on the counts of `F` and `S`.
   - If the list `sa` (scenarios with more `F` transitions) is larger or equal to `sb`, it tries to fill in the remaining `?` with `F` where appropriate.
   - Otherwise, it tries to fill in the remaining `?` with `S` where appropriate.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic for filling in the `?` values is flawed. The current implementation attempts to fill in `F` or `S` based on the size of `sa` and `sb`, but this does not ensure that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive `F` or `S` is met.
   - The code does not consider the entire sequence of transitions for any permutation of scenarios, which is necessary to meet the problem's requirements.
   - The code does not handle the case where both `sa` and `sb` are of similar size, which could lead to incorrect solutions.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the transition videos meet the required constraint for any permutation of scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
