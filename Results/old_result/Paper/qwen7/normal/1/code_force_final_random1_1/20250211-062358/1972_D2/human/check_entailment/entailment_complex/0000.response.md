Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- Function `func_1()` is designed to solve this problem for a single test case by iterating over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checking the conditions.
- Function `func_2()` is designed to handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
- The provided comments and the annotated function descriptions correctly describe the behavior of the functions.
- The logic in `func_1()` correctly checks the conditions for each pair \((x, y)\) and counts the valid pairs.
- The logic in `func_2()` correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1()` and handles the input and output as required by the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the functions appear to be implemented correctly and meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
