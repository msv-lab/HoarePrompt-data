Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1, `smin` is a list of integers, `smin` has its value appended with `smin[i]`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). The list `b` and the integer `k` remain the same. The list `l` and the list `suf` also remain unchanged. The variable `n` remains the length of the list `l`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The list `smin` now has one additional element, which is the value of `smin[i]` (where `i` is the new value of `i` after incrementing).
