Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: The problem involves two different types of moves by Alice and Bob:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it.
   
   However, the current implementation does not simulate these moves accurately. Instead, it seems to be trying to solve a different problem related to finding the smallest missing integer in a sequence, which is not aligned with the game rules.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**: The function `func_1` attempts to handle the game moves but does not properly simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob. It also does not account for the fact that Alice can choose any element from `a`, whereas Bob can only choose from what remains after Alice's turn.

3. **Output Calculation**: The current logic prints a value without properly simulating the game and determining the optimal strategy for both players. The output should reflect the MEX of the final array `c` after both players have played optimally.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game according to the rules and determine the optimal moves for both players. Here is a more appropriate approach:

```python
def optimal_game_score(n, arr):
    # Count the frequency of each number in the array
    freq = [0] * n
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if freq[i] % 2 == 1:
            # If there is an odd count, the player who can make the last move will ensure the MEX is i
            mex = i + 1
            break
    
    return mex

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(optimal_game_score(n, arr))
```

This solution works as follows:
- It counts the frequency of each number in the array.
- It checks for the smallest index `i` where `freq[i]` is odd. This indicates that the player who makes the last move (either Alice or Bob) can ensure the MEX is `i + 1`.
- Finally, it returns the calculated MEX.

This approach correctly simulates the game and determines the optimal score based on the given rules.
