Output State: **`i` is 2 or more, `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]` or the condition holds true for the next index, and `new[i]` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

This means that the variable `i` remains 2 or more, and the condition that `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]` or the condition holds true for the next index remains valid. Additionally, the new list `new` now has an element at index `i` which is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
