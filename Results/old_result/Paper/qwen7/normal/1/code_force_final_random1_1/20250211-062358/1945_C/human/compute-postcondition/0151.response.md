Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, `final` is now `[n]`, and `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, with `c1` being less than 50.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Initially, `final` is an empty list, so after appending `n`, `final` becomes `[n]`. The other variables (`mini` and `c1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
