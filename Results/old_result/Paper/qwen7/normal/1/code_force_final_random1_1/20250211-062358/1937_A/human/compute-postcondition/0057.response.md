The only variable in the loop head is `power`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `power`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is increased by 1 and is now less than `n`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `power` must be less than `n` again, but since it was just increased by 1, it must still be less than `n`.

State: **`power` is increased by 1 and is now less than `n`**
