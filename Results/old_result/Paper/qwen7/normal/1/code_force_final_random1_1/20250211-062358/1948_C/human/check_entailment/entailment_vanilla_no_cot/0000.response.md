Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n):

1. **Incorrect Logic for Blocking Paths**: The logic in the loop checks for specific patterns (`a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`) which do not accurately represent all blocking scenarios. This check only considers certain cases where the robot cannot move from one cell to another due to the direction of arrows. However, the solution should consider all possible ways the robot could be blocked from reaching the target cell.

2. **Missing Handling of Even Columns**: Since `n` is guaranteed to be even, the solution should handle this properly. The current implementation does not account for all possible configurations of arrows that could block the robot from reaching the target cell.

3. **Printing 'Yes' at the End**: If the loop completes without finding a blocking condition, the solution prints 'yes'. However, this approach is overly simplistic and does not cover all cases where the robot might still be able to reach the target cell.

A more robust solution would involve simulating the robot's movement through the grid and checking if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_reach_target(n, a, b):
    row1 = list(a)
    row2 = list(b)
    position = (0, 0)  # Start at (1, 1)

    while True:
        x, y = position
        if y == n - 1:
            return True
        elif y % 2 == 0:  # Even column
            if row1[y] == '<':
                position = (x, y - 1)
            else:
                position = (x, y + 1)
        else:  # Odd column
            if row2[y] == '<':
                position = (x, y - 1)
            else:
                position = (x, y + 1)
        if position[1] >= n or position[1] < 0:
            return False
        if position == (1, n - 1):
            return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if can_reach_target(n, a, b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n) by handling both rows and ensuring the robot does not move out of bounds.
