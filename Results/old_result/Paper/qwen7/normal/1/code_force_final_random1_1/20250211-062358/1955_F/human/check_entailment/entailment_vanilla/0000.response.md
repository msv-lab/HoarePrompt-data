Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input containing four integers: `p_i` (number of ones, twos, threes, and fours).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program converts the input into a list `p` using `map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split())`.
     - This lambda function `int(x) - int(x) % 2` essentially rounds down each integer to the nearest even number.
     - For example, if the input is `1 1 1 0`, the list `p` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The program then prints the result of two expressions:
     1. `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2`
     - `list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))` creates a list of booleans indicating whether the first three elements of `p` are odd.
     - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` sums these booleans, effectively counting the number of odd numbers among the first three elements.
     - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all three of the first elements are odd.
     - `sum(p) // 2` calculates the total number of elements divided by 2.
     - The final expression combines these results.

### Correctness Check:

- **Objective:** Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, i.e., the maximum number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.
- **Key Insight:** The XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each bit (1, 2, 3, 4) is even. Removing an element that changes the parity of the count of a specific bit can affect the outcome.

### Issues in the Given Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic in the program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of odd numbers among the first three elements and adds half the sum of the elements, which does not reflect the actual strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `1 1 1 0`, the program outputs `1` but the correct answer should be `1`.
   - For the input `1 0 1 2`, the program outputs `1` but the correct answer should be `1`.
   - For the input `2 2 2 0`, the program outputs `3` but the correct answer should be `3`.
   - For the input `3 3 2 0`, the program outputs `3` but the correct answer should be `3`.
   - For the input `0 9 9 9`, the program outputs `12` but the correct answer should be `12`.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
