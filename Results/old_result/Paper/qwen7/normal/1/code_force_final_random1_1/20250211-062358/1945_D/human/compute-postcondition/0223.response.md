Output State: **`custo' is now the original value of `custo` plus `b_values[y]` for the current value of `y` plus `a_values[0]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `custo` was being updated. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the value of `custo` remains as it was calculated before the `break`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial condition of `custo` being the original value plus the specified additions, and indicates that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
