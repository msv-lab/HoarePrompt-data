Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `k` is `k - 2n + 4`, `x` is `l[-2]`, and the second element of list `l` is now the original third last element of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. This means that the second element of the list (which was the original second last element) is now the third last element. The values of `i`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
