Based on the initial state provided:

- `one` is True.
- `two` is False.
- `tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` after all elements have been popped from `rev[tmp]`.

We need to evaluate the expression `print('Hermione' if two and one else 'Ron')`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The condition `two and one` checks if both `two` and `one` are True.
2. Since `two` is False, the condition `two and one` evaluates to False.
3. Therefore, the expression inside the `if` part is not executed, and the expression inside the `else` part is evaluated and printed.

Given this, the output will be `'Ron'`.

Output: **Ron**
