Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', and `l` is either less than `r` or equal to `r` (with `r` being 0). In both cases, `i` remains 0, `n` remains greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` remains equal to '>'. If `r` is 0, then `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. If `r` is not 0, then `l` is greater than `r` by at least 1, and the value of `b` is defined as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)`.
