Reasoning:
1. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that is supposed to update the position of an entity on the field based on a direction. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. The function should take a position `(x, y)` and a direction `(dx, dy)` and return the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
2. In the execution summary, it states that `func_1` takes two parameters: `a` (a tuple of field dimensions) and `b` (a tuple of game steps). This is incorrect. The function `func_1` should only take a position and a direction, as defined in the problem statement.
3. The function `func_1` in the provided code returns four values (`x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`) instead of returning a new position tuple. This means the function does not correctly implement the intended logic.

Given these issues, the provided code is incorrect because it misdefines the function `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
