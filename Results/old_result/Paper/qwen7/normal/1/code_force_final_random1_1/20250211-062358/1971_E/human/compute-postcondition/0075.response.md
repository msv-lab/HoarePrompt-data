Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b) + len(a) - 1`, `l` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the result of adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration from `0` to `len(a) - 1`, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration, and `t` is reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The values of `i`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, `t`, and the list variables `a`, `b`, `bd`, `ad`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, these variables retain their initial relationships and expressions.
