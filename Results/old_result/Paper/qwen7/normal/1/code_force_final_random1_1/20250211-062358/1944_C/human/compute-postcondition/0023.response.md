Output State: **`start` is 2; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`; `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 1`; `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2; `nums[2]` must be non-zero.**

Explanation: The code `vis.add(start)` adds the value of `start` (which is 2) to the set `vis`. Initially, `vis` contained the elements 0 and 1. After adding `start`, `vis` now contains 0, 1, and 2. The other variables (`nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]`) remain unchanged from their initial states. `nums[2]` must still be non-zero.
