Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is either 'SS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'FF'.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - The character at position `j-1` (which is 1) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `j` is currently 2.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.

5. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` changes from 2 to 3.
   - `n` remains the same.

7. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `nx` remains unchanged and can still be 'SS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'FF'.
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `nx` is either 'SS' or 'FS' or 'SF' or 'FF', `j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer.**
