Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1; `new` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1` with the exception that `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1`; the condition `i != len(a)` holds.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new[i]` to be `max(a[i], b[i])`. Since `i` was originally equal to the length of `a`, after updating `new[i]`, `i` is now one less than the length of `a`. All other conditions and lists remain unchanged.
