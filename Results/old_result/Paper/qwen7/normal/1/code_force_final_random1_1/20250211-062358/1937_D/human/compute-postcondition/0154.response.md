Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` itself is not used in the print statement).
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `a` is `A[l]`, where `A` is a list and `A[l]` is the element at index `l` of the list `A`.
   - `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`, where `idx_B` is a list and `idx_B[r - 1]` is the element at index `r - 1` of the list `idx_B`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Calculating the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `a` is `A[l]`. Since `A[l]` is not specified, let's denote it as `A[l] = a_value`.
   - `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`. Since `idx_B[r - 1]` and `l` are not specified, let's denote `idx_B[r - 1]` as `b_index_value` and `l` as `l_value`. Therefore, `b = (b_index_value - 1) * (l_value + 1)`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. Since `r` and `l` are not specified, let's denote `r` as `r_value` and `l` as `l_value`. Therefore, `x = r_value - (l_value + 2)`.

4. **Substituting into the Print Statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the known values: `a * 2 + ((b_index_value - 1) * (l_value + 1)) * 2 + 1 + 1`.

5. **Final Expression:**
   - The final expression simplifies to `2 * A[l] + 2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)) + 2`.

Given the explicit values and the formula, the print statement will output:
Output: **2 * A[l] + 2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)) + 2**
