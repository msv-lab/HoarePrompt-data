Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. It initializes the arrays `a` and `b` with the given points and times.
3. It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and the corresponding speeds in `b`.
4. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment of `a` where the query point `d` lies.
5. If the query point exactly matches a known point, it directly returns the corresponding time.
6. Otherwise, it interpolates the time using the known speeds and distances.
7. The function correctly handles all constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
