Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `b` is a list

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will increment from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'L':
     - `b` contains one element which is `a[l]`
     - `l` is increased by 1
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'L':
     - `b` contains one element `a[r-1]` appended to it

4. **Current State:**
   - Since `i` is 0, the character at index 0 of `s` is checked.
   - Depending on the value of this character, either `a[l]` or `a[r-1]` is added to `b`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue, but it must still be greater than 0.
   - The state of `b` depends on the character at index 1 of `s`. However, since we are only asked to adjust the loop head variables, we do not need to change `b` here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` becomes 1
- `n` remains greater than 0

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
