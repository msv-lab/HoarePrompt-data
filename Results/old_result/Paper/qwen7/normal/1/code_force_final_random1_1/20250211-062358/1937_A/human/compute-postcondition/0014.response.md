Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 3**.

Explanation: The initial value of `power` is 2. After executing `power += 1`, the value of `power` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
