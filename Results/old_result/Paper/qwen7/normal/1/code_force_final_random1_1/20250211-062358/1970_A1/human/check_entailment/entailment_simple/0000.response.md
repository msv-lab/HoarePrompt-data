Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly implements the logic to perform the balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
2. The `func_2` function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, where each object stores the balance at each position and the corresponding character.
3. The `balance_info` list is then sorted according to the rules specified: first by the balance in ascending order, and then by the position in descending order for ties.
4. Finally, the sorted characters are concatenated to form the result, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the implementation appears to follow the correct steps to achieve the desired output. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
