Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`; `s` remains the same; `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a'; `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`; `cnt` is increased by 1 to be 2; `ans` remains the first character of `s`.**

Explanation: The line `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary representation of `1` to the left by `cur_ss` positions and adds it to `cur`. Here, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the second character of `s` and the ASCII value of `'a'`. The value of `cur` is updated accordingly. The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
