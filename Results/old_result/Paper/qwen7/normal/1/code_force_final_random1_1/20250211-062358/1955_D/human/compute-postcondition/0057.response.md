Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, and `cnt_b` is a dictionary mapping integers to counts. If `a[i]` is present in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged.
