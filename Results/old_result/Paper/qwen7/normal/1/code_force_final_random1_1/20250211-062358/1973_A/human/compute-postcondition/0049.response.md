Postcondition: `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1`, and `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` becomes `[-1, -1, -1]`. Otherwise, `resultats` becomes `[-1, -1, egalites // 2]`.
