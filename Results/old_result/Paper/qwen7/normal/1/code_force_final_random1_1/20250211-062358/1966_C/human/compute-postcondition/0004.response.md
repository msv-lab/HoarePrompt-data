Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element, `dp` is set to True.**

The code initializes the variable `dp` to `True`. Since `tc`, `n`, and `arr` were part of the initial state and no operations were performed on them, their values remain unchanged.
