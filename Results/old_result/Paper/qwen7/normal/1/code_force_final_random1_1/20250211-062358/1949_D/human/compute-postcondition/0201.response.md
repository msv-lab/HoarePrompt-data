Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is between 1 and `n + 1` (inclusive), `j` is an index such that either `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and the condition involving `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
