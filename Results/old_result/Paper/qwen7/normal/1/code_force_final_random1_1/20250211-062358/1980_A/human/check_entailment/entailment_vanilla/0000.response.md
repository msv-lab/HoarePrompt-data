Reasoning:

1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `m`, and `a`.
3. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using a list `freq` of size 7.
4. It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds by calculating `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` and summing these values.
5. Finally, it appends the total number of missing problems to the `results` list.
6. The loop iterates over all test cases and returns the list of results.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
