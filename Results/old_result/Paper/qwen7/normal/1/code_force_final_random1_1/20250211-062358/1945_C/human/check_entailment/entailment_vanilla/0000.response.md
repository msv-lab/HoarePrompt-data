Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The goal is to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied.
   - The satisfaction condition is checked using the count of '0's and '1's on each side of the chosen position `i`.

2. **Key Points in the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the target position `pk` (middle position).
   - It counts the number of '0's and '1's in the input string `s`.
   - It iterates through each position `i` from 0 to `n-2` to check the satisfaction conditions for both sides.
   - If the conditions are met, the position `i+1` is added to the list `lst`.
   - It then finds the position that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle position `pk`.
   - Finally, it prints the smallest such position.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The calculation of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` is unnecessary and might lead to precision issues due to integer division.
   - The satisfaction condition should directly use the counts of '0's and '1's without percentage calculations.
   - The handling of the case when no valid position is found needs improvement. The current logic might not handle the edge cases properly.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The main logic of finding the optimal position `i` seems correct.
   - The precision issue in calculating percentages can be avoided by directly checking the counts.
   - The handling of the edge cases (all '0's or all '1's) is not fully addressed in the current implementation.

Given these points, the core logic is correct but there are some minor improvements needed for better clarity and correctness.

Correctness: **False**
