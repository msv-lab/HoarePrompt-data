The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, followed by a list of `l` integers. It then reverses the list and creates a new list `ans` where each element is determined by counting occurrences of the corresponding element in the reversed list and mapping it to a character from 'a' to 'z'. Finally, it prints a string formed by these characters for each test case.
