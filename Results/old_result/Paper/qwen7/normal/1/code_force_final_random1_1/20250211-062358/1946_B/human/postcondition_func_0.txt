The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( l \) of \( n \) integers. It calculates a value \( sm \) based on these inputs using suffix sums and minimum suffix sums, adjusts \( sm \) to ensure it is non-negative and within the range modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), and prints the result for each test case.
