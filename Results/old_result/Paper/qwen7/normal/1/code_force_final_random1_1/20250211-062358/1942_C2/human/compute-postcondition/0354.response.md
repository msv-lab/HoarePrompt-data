Postcondition: `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 but has one less element than before, `y` is either 0 or `y - current_gap // 2`, `ans` is updated by adding `2 * (y - current_gap // 2)` to its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `y < gap // 2`.
