Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`, and it iterates over the range from `0` to `l-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `l` must be a positive integer
   - `ans` now contains two elements where the second element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, if `j` is currently `1`, the next value of `j` will be `2`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < l`.
   - Given that `j` is currently `1`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `l`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` will be updated to `2`.
   - `l` remains a positive integer.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `j`. Specifically, the second element of `ans` will be `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`, which means the second element will be `alp[rev_array[2:].count(rev_array[2]) - 1]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `l` must be a positive integer, `ans` now contains two elements where the second element is `alp[rev_array[2:].count(rev_array[2]) - 1]`**
