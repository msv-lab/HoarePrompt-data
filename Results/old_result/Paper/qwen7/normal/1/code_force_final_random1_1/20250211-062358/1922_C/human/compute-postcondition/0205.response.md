Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \), a strictly increasing list of \( n \) integers \( a \), an integer \( m \), and two lists \( x \) and \( y \) each containing \( m \) integers. It then calculates and prints the difference in values from the list \( a \) between indices specified by corresponding pairs in lists \( x \) and \( y \). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each pair.**
