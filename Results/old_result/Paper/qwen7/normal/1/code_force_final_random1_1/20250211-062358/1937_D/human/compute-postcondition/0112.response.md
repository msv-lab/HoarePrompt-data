Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and the current value of `l` is greater than 0; `a` is equal to the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a` becoming `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, which further simplifies to `a` being `A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
