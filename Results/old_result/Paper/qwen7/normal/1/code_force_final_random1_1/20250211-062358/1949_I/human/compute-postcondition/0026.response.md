Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bipartite` is True
   - `tot` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `ok` is True

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `n`.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should reflect:
- `i` being incremented to 2
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2

The other variables (`bipartite`, `tot`, and `ok`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State:**
State: **`bipartite` is True, `tot` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `ok` is True**
