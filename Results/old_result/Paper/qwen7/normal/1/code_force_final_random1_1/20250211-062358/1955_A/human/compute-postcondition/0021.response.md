Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `i` is 1. This value also does not affect the print statement directly.
- `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value.
- `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value.
- `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

Given the values:
- `X = A // 2`
- `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value.
- `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.

The expression `X * C + B` translates to `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of this expression.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
