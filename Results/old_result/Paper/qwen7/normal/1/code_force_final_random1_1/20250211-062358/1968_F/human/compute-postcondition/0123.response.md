To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and their states that are involved in the loop head. The loop head includes the loop counter `_` and the condition that controls the loop's continuation.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(q):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break down the relevant states:

1. **Loop Counter (`_`)**: The loop counter is an underscore `_` which is a common practice to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. However, the loop itself depends on the range being non-empty, i.e., `q > 0`.

2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `q` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `q` is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
