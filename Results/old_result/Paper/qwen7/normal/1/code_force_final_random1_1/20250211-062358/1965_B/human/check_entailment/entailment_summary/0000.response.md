Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers that meets specific criteria.
2. The function `func_14()` is designed to solve the problem directly, and its logic aligns with the problem statement.
3. Let's break down the logic of `func_14()`:
   - It first reads `n` and `k` from the input using `func_7()`.
   - It converts `n` to its binary representation and calculates its length `l`.
   - Depending on the value of `k`:
     - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case and returns "1\n2".
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence `ans`:
       - Adds powers of 2 from \(2^1\) to \(2^{l-1}\).
       - Adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of some subsequence is `k - 1`.
       - Adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to cover additional sums.
       - Completes the sequence with more powers of 2 from \(2^l\) onwards.
4. The constructed sequence `ans` ensures:
   - No subsequence has a sum of `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.
5. The function `func_15()` correctly iterates over the test cases and prints the results generated by `func_14()`.

Given the analysis, the provided functions, especially `func_14()`, correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
