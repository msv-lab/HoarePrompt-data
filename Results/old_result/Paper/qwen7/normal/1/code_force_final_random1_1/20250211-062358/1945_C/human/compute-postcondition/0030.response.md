Output State: **`one` is either 1 or 2; `zero` is either 1 or 0; `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `one` is incremented by 1. Since `one` was either 0 or 1 initially, after the increment, `one` can now be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
