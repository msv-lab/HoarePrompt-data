Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value.
- `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value.
- `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print(A * B)
```

Here, the print statement will multiply the values of `A` and `B` and then print the result. Since `A` and `B` are explicitly defined as being obtained from the first and second input values respectively, we can directly use these values in our output.

Output: **[A] * [B] (where A is the first input value and B is the second input value)**
