Output State: The `queue` is an empty deque, as all nodes reachable from the starting node have been processed. The `current` is the last node that was checked before the loop terminated, and `dist` is the shortest distance from the start node to this `current` node. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been visited during the entire traversal, ensuring that no node was revisited. The loop has completed all iterations, and the shortest path distances to all reachable nodes from the start node are stored in the `queue`.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the `queue` is empty because all nodes have been processed. The `current` and `dist` reflect the last node and its distance processed before the loop ended. The `visited` set includes all nodes that were part of the traversal, confirming that the entire connected component of the tree starting from the `start` node has been explored.
