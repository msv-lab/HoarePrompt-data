Output State: **`sm` is set to the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for any `i` from 0 to `n`, or remains -111 if no such value exists.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `sm` will hold the highest value found among `suf[i] - smin[i]` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n`. If no such value exists (or if the initial value of `sm` is -111 and never gets updated), `sm` will remain -111.
