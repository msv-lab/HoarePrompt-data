Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `n` must be at least 3 and an odd number.
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs with the condition `i` in the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2. This means `i` takes values 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than `n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`**: In the previous iteration, `i` was 3.

4. **Next Possible Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next possible value of `i` would be 5 (if `n` allows it).

5. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true. However, since we are only asked to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume this condition is not met and no change occurs.

6. **Adjusting the State**: Given that `i` was 3 in the previous iteration and the loop will increment `i` by 2, the next value of `i` would be 5, provided `n` is greater than 5. Since `n` must be at least 3 and an odd number, and given that `i` was 3, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 5.
- `n` must be at least 5 and an odd number.

State: **`n` must be at least 5 and an odd number, `i` is 5**
