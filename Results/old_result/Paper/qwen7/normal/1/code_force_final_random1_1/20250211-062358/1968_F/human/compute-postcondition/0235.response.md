Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10 (since `idx` was increased by 8 and now `idx + 2` is accessed), `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` now either contains 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l` being satisfied in the if part, or if these conditions are not met, `results` contains 'NO', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. Initially, `idx` was increased by 8, so now it is increased by a total of 10. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them.
