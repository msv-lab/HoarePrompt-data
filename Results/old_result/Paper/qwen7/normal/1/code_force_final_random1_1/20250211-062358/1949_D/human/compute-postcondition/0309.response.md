Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. In this case, the loop variable is `i`, and the loop runs from 1 to `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n + 1` must hold true. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within the range `[1, n]`.

3. **Update the State**: After the loop completes one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop is to continue, `i` must be `n` (the current upper limit) plus 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nx` is a string constructed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration from 1 to \( n \).
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n`.
- `nx` is the string constructed up to the \( n \)-th iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `nx` remains the same as it is already constructed up to `n`.
- `i` is incremented to `n + 1`.

So, the new state is:
State: **`nx` is a string constructed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration from 1 to \( n \), `i` is \( n + 1 \)**.
