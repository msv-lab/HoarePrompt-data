Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the solution only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

To maximize the beauty, we should pair the smallest value with the largest value, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This approach ensures that the positive differences are maximized while minimizing the negative differences.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            max_beauty += a[n - 1 - i] - a[i]
        if n % 2 == 1:
            max_beauty += a[n // 2]
        print(max_beauty)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then iteratively pairs the smallest and largest remaining elements to compute the maximum possible beauty.
