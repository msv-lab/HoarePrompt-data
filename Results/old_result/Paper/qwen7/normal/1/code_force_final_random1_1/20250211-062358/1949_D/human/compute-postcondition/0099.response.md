Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `x` is a list, `a[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Since `j` is `n + 1`, the specific value of `a[n + 1]` is increased by 1. The other variables (`x` and `a[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
