Output State: `i` is `-1`, `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`, and `ar` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will decrement from `len(ar) - 1` to `-1`. The loop updates the `res` list such that for each index `i`, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`. Since the loop continues to update `res` based on the current value of `mex` and the elements of `ar`, by the end of the loop, `res` will contain the values `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` in `ar`. The variable `mex` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution, and the list `ar` is not modified.
