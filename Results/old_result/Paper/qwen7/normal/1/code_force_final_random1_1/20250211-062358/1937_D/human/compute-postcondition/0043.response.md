Postcondition: **`B` is a list where if `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is [0]. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`. `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters found so far, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'.**
