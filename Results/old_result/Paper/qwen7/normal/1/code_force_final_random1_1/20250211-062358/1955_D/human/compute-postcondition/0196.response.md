Output State: **`a[i]` is an element of array `a` with its count in `cnt_b` incremented by 1, `b_values` retains its previous set of values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans` retain their previous values, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + m`.**

This means that the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The variable `i` has been updated to `i + 1`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `i + m` still holds true.
