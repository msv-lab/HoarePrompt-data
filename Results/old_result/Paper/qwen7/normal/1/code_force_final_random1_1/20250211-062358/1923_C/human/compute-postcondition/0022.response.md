Output State: **`i` is increased by the next element in `l`, `x` is the next element in `l`, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `j` is increased by 1, `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by the next `x`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increases the value of `j` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which means `i` is increased by the next element in `l`, `x` is the next element in `l`, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by the next `x`, and `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.
