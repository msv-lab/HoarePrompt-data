The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ele` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ele` and the list `lst`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. This means that `mini` is now the minimum value found so far between its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the current element `ele`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` must be the next element in the list `lst`. Therefore, we need to update the state such that `ele` is the next element in the list.

Assuming the list `lst` has at least one more element, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - next_element_in_lst)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst`**
