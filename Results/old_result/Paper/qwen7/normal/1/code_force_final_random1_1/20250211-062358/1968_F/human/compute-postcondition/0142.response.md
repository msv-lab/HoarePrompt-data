Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`; if the conditions `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` are met, `results` list contains 'YES', otherwise `results` list contains 'NO'.**
