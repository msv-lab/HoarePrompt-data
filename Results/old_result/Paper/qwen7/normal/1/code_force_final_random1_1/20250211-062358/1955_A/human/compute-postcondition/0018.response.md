Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value.
- `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value.
- `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.

The `print(A * B)` statement will print the product of `A` and `B`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their source.

Output: **[A] * [B]** (where `[A]` is the integer obtained from the first input value and `[B]` is the integer obtained from the second input value)
