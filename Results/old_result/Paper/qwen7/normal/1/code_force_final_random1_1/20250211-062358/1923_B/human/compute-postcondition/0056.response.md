Output State: **`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `distance` is 1, `rest` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Since `delta` is defined as the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `rest` is not 0 and `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `rest` is decreased by `delta`. The other variables (`distance` and `pos`) remain unchanged.
