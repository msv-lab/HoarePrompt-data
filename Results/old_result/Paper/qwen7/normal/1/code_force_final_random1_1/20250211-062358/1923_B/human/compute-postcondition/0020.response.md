Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, and `rest` is now `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Given that `delta` is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, the value of `rest` is updated to `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. The other variables (`distance`, `pos`, and `len(sorted_indices)`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
