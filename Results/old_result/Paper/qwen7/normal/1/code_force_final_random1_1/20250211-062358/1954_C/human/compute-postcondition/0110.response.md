Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1 + 1; `new` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1` with the exception that `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1`; `new2[i]` is now `max(a[i], b[i])`; the condition `i != len(a)` holds.**

In simpler terms, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and lists remain unchanged.
