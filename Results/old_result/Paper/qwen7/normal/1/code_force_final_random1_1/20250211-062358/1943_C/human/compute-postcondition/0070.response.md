Output State: **`i` is 5, `c1` is unchanged, `ops` now contains the tuples (`c1`, 3), (`c2`, 1), (`c2`, 3), (`c1`, 5), (`c2`, 5)**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 5, the new tuple added is `(c2, 5)`. The values of `i` and `c1` remain unchanged, and the existing tuples in `ops` are preserved.
