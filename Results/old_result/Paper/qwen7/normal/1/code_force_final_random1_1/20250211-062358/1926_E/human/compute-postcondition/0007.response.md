Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. This simplifies to `n - n // 2 - 1 // 2`, which further simplifies to `n // 2 - 0.5`. Since `n` is an integer, `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2, and subtracting `0.5` results in `n // 2 - 0.5`, which means `n` becomes half of its original value, rounded down.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged and is still `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `L` is updated by appending `m` to it, making `L` a list containing one element, which is `m`.
- The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
