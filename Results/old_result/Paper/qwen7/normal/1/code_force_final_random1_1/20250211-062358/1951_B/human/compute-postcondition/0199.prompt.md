Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of integers with the first element and the k-1th element swapped; `ans` is 0; `h` is equal to the first element of `s`; `j` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `s`, `j` is increased by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `h` is greater than or equal to `i`; otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `s`, `j` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `h` is not less than `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the fourth element of `s`, `j` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `h` is not less than `i`. If `h` is less than `i`, `j` is still increased by 1, and `ans` is not increased.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
