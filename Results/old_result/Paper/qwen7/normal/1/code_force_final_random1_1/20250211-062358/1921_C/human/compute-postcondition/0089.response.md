Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than or equal to the maximum index present in `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`), `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for every `j` in the range from `3` to `n-1` inclusive, provided that `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`. If the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**
