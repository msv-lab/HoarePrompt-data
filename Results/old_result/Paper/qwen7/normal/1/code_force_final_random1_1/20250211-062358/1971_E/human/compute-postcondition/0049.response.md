Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer.**

The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `ql`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input for `ql` is yet to be provided, hence it is referred to as "an input integer."
