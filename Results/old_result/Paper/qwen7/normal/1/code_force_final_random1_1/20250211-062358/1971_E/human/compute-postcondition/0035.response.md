Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer.**

The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `ql`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 is not checked or enforced by this line of code, so it remains a requirement for the variable `q`.
