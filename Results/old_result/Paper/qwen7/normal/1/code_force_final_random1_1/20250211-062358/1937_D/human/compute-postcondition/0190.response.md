Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r` is not 0. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` is decreased by `A[l - r - 2]` and further decreased by `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
