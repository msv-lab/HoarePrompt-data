Postcondition: **`j` is within the range 3 to \( n \), \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` is either incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', 'S' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `j` will be 3 (since it was incremented from 2 in the previous iteration), `n` will remain an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` will be updated according to the specified conditions based on the values of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j` relative to the first quarter of `sb`.
