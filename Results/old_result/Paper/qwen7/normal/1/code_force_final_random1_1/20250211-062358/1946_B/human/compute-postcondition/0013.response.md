Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], suf[2] + l[2]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is `i + 1` and `i` is now less than `n`**.

Explanation: The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends a new element to the list `suf`. Given that `suf` was initially `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]]`, the next element to append is `suf[2] + l[2]`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and since it was already less than `n` (the length of `l`), after incrementing, `i` is still less than `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
