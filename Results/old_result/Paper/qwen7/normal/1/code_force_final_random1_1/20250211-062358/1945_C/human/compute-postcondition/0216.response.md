The only objects in the loop head are the variables `elem` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `elem` and the list `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `pk` is an integer, `elem` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, and `final` contains the element `elem`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `lst` must still contain at least one more element, and `elem` will be the next element in the list.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `lst` still contains at least one more element, and `elem` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`pk` is an integer, `elem` is an integer (next element in `lst`), `mini` is an integer, and `final` contains the element `elem`.**
