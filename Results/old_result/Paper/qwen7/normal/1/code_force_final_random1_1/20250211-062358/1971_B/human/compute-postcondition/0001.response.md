State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n` must be true.
- Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.
- Additionally, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 0 and `n` being greater than 0.
