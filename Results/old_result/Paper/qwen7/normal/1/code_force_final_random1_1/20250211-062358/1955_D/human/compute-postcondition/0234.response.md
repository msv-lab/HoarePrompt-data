Output State: **`ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b` in the range from `n - m` to `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `curr` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `curr = 0` initializes the variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `b_values`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
