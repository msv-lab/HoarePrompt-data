Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer and at least 13, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is 2 + (n + 3) // (3 * 3)**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `ans` was initially 2, and `n` is a positive integer at least 13, the new value of `ans` becomes `2 + (n + 3) // 9`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and the updated `ans` are included in the output state.
