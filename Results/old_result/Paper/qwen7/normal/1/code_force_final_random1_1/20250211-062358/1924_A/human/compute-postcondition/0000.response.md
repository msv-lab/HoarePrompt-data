Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, `s`) remain in their initial undefined state as no operations were performed on them.
