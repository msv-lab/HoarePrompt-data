Postcondition: **`bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in both lists `a` and `b`, and the number of 1s in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 1s in `b`; otherwise, `bOnes` is 2. `t` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2.**
