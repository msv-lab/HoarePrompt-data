Output State: **`results` is a list containing the sequence of `current_year` values calculated during each iteration of the loop for all test cases, and `current_year` is the final value calculated for the last test case.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain one `current_year` value for each test case from `test_cases`. Each `current_year` value represents the smallest multiple of the elements in the list `a` for that test case that is greater than or equal to the initial `current_year`. The final value of `current_year` will be the one calculated for the last test case in `test_cases`.
