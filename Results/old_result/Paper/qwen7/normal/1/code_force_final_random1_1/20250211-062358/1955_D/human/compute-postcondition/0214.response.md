Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` which iterates over `b_values`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `b_values` for `i` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b_values` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is an element of `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is an element of `b_values`, and the loop continues as long as `b_values` has elements, for the loop to continue, `b_values` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in `b_values` that hasn't been processed yet.
   - `cnt_b[i]` will be updated during the loop body, but at the start of the next iteration, it will be 0 if it was not incremented in the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `b_values` still contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

**State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is an element of `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**
