Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 2, and all other variables (`total`, `t`, `results`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. The other variables (`total`, `t`, `results`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp`) are not affected by this operation and retain their previous values.
