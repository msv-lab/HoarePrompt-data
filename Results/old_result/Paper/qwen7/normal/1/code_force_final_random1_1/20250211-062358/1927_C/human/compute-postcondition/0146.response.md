Output State: **`t` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
