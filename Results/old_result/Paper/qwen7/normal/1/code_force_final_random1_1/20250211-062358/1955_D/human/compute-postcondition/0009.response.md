Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `max_val` is 1000000
   - `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with the element at index `b[i]` incremented by 1
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` is at least 1

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged because it is determined by the input and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains the same: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `max_val` remains the same: 1000000
   - `cnt_b` remains the same: `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with the element at index `b[1]` incremented by 1
   - `b` remains the same: a list of integers obtained from the input split
   - `i` is now 2
   - `m` remains at least 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with the element at index `b[1]` incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1**
