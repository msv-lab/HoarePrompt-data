Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aaa'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to the variable `word`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `n - 3` will be an integer between -2 and 23. Assuming `alphabet` is a list of lowercase English letters (`['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z']`), `alphabet[n - 3]` will be the character at the index `n - 3`. Since `n` is between 1 and 26, `n - 3` will be between -2 and 23, but only the valid indices (0-23) will be considered. For simplicity, let's assume `alphabet[n - 3]` is a valid letter, thus appending `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to `word` results in `word` being `'aaa'`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
