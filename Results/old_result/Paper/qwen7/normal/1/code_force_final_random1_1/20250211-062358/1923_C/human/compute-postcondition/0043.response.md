Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. The values of `c` and `p` are not affected by this operation.
