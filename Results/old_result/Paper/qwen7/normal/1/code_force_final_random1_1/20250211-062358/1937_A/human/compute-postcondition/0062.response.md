Based on the initial state provided:

- `power` is equal to `n`
- `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

Given that `power` is equal to `n`, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** n`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be \(2^n\).

Output: **2^n**
