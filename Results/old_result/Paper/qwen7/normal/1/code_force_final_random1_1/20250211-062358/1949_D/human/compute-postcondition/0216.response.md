Postcondition: `nx` is a string that has been updated based on the condition of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is updated by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to the original `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` is either updated to "F" followed by the original `nx`, or 'S' followed by the original `nx`, depending on whether `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or not. Both `n` being greater than or equal to 1 and `i` being `n + 1` remain true after the execution.
