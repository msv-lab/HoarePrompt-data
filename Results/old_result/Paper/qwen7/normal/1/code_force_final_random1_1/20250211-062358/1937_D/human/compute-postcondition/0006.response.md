Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', and the length of `idx_A` is 1, and `A` contains the element 0.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `A`. Initially, `idx_A` was an empty list, so its length was `0`. After appending `0` to `A`, the length of `idx_A` becomes `1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
