Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the `func` function correctly computes the maximum balance of the problemset.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems. The program should find the maximum divisor \(i\) such that \(x - n \cdot i \geq 0\) and both \(x - n \cdot i\) and \(x\) are divisible by \(i\).
2. **Range of \(i\)**: The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{x}\), which is an efficient approach to check potential divisors.
3. **Conditions for Valid Sub-problems**: For each \(i\), the program checks if \(x - n \cdot i \geq 0\) and if both \(x - n \cdot i\) and \(x\) are divisible by \(i\). This ensures that the sub-problems have valid difficulties.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies potential divisors \(i\) of \(x\) within the range from 1 to \(\sqrt{x}\).
- It checks if these divisors can be used to split \(x\) into \(n\) sub-problems such that each sub-problem has a difficulty that is a multiple of \(i\).
- The maximum such \(i\) is stored and printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly compute the maximum balance.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided execution summary and the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset.

Correctness: **True**
