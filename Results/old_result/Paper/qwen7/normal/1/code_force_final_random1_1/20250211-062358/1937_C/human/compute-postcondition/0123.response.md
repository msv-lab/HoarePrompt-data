Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `best` is 1
   - `res` is '<'
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is `n-1`
   - `n` is the input integer provided by the user

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the first iteration, `i` will be `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now `2`, the condition `i < n` will be true if `n > 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `best` remains unchanged at `1`.
   - `res` remains unchanged at `'<>'`.
   - `i` is incremented by `1`, so it becomes `2`.
   - `k` remains unchanged at `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same as the input integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`best` is 1, `res` is '<', `i` is 2, `k` is `n-1`, and `n` is the input integer provided by the user**.
