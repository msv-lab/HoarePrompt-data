Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(a)` + 1, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, and `new2[i]` is updated to be the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the current index `i`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is less than `len(a)` and equals `i+1`, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is less than `len(a)` - 1, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and the i-th element is updated to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and the i-th element is updated to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `new` is updated such that `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
