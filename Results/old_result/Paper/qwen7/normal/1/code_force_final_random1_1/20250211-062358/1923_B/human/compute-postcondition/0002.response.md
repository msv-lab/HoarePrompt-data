Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer.
