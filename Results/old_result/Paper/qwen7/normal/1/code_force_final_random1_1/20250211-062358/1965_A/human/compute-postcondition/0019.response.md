Output State: **`not_c` is False, `A` is False, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `A` is originally set to `True`. The code snippet `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to the opposite of its current value. Since `A` was `True`, after executing the code, `A` becomes `False`. The values of `not_c` and `i` remain unchanged.
