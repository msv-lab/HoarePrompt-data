Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True else `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.**

The code assigns the value of `obj` to `player` if `obj` is a player, otherwise, it assigns the value of the cell in the `grid` at the position `nxt` to `player`. The other variables remain unchanged.
