Postcondition: `sm` is updated based on the condition where if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is set to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Given the precondition that `i` is `k + 1` and `n` is `N`, the value of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and only `sm` is updated according to the specified condition.
