Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `-1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `ar`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `ar` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will become `-1` because the loop decrements `i` starting from `len(ar) - 1` until it reaches `-1`. The value of `mex` is determined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `ar`. The list `res` is filled such that for each index `i`, `res[i]` equals `mex - ar[i]`. The list `ar` remains unaltered as it is not modified within the loop.
