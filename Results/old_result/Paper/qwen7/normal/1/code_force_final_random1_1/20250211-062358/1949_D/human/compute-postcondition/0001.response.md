Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, where all elements are 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, and each element is set to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the new list `a` is created with the specified length.
