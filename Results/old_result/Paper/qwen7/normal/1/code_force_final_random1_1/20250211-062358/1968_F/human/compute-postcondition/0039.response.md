Output State: `idx` is 6 + n, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], and `i` is `n + 1`, `mp[pf[n+1]]` is a list containing the value `n + 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will be equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a`. The list `a` will contain the integer values from `data` starting from index 6 up to the end of the data list. The list `pf` will contain the cumulative XOR results of the elements in `a`. The dictionary `mp` will map the final `pf` value to the list `[n + 1]`.
