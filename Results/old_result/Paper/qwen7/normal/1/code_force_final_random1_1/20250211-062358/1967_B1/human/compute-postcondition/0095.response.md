Output State: **`total` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is at least 4, `count` is increased by 1, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `int(n / count) - countmins`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 2**.

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
