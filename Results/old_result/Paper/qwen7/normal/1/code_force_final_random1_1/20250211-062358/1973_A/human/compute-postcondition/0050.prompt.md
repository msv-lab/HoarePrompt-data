Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `resultats` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, `-1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `egalites` remains as `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`. Otherwise, `egalites` is updated to `egalites // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `resultats` is a list with an additional element either `-1` or `egalites // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` depending on whether `egalites` is less than 0 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1`, and `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` becomes `[-1, -1, -1]`. Otherwise, `resultats` becomes `[-1, -1, egalites // 2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
