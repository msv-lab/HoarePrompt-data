Output State: **`l` is 0, `B` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of distances from the rightmost '>' character to all '<' characters encountered so far, multiplied by the number of '<' characters seen up to that point, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `r` is the length of `B`.**

The code `r = len(B)` assigns the length of the list `B` to the variable `r`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the length of `B` is stored in `r`, while all other variables remain in their original states.
