Postcondition: `ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` remains the same, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 4, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s` plus the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'. This is because if the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is true, then `cur` becomes 0 and the other variables are updated accordingly. If the condition is false, the original values remain unchanged.
