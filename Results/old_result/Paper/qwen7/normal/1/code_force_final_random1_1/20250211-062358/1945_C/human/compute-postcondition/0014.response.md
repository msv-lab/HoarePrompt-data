Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `pk` is `n / 2`, `s` is a string input by the user, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `lst`. No changes are made to the values of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `pk`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`). Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged, and only the new list `lst` is added to the state.
