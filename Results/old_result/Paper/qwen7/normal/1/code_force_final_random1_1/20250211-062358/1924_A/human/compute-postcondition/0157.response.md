Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the concatenation of the second character of `s` with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt` being incremented by 1, while `ss`, `s`, `cur_ss`, `ans`, and `cur` retain their original values and relationships.
