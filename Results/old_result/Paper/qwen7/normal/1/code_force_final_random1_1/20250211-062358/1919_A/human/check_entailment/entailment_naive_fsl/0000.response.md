Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. According to the problem, the game involves taking turns and removing one coin from the player's current wallet until someone cannot make a valid move. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not simulate this process at all. Instead, they simply determine the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, which is not a correct strategy for the game as described.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following example:

- Test case: \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\)

According to the rules, the game would proceed as follows:
1. Alice starts with \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
2. Alice can either swap wallets or remove a coin from her wallet. If she removes a coin, \(a = 0\) and it becomes Bob's turn.
3. Bob now has \(a = 0\) and \(b = 1\). He can only remove a coin from Bob's wallet, making \(b = 0\).
4. It is now Alice's turn again, but she cannot make a valid move because her wallet is empty.

Thus, Bob wins in this scenario. However, the function `func_1` incorrectly returns "Bob" for the case where \(a + b = 2\) (even), which is not correct according to the game rules.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and hence is incorrect.
