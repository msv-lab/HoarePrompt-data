Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Pre-computation:**
   ```python
   A = []
   sum = 0
   for i in range(1, 200001):
       a = func_1(i)
       sum = sum + a
       A.append(sum)
   ```
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - It stores these sums in the list `A`.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficient for the precomputation step.

2. **Reading Test Cases:**
   ```python
   for t in range(int(input())):
       n = int(input())
       print(A[n - 1])
   ```
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and prints `A[n - 1]`.
   - This correctly retrieves the precomputed sum for the numbers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1(num):
       a = 0
       while num != 0:
           a = a + num % 10
           num = int(num / 10)
       return a
   ```
   - The function `func_1` computes the sum of the digits of a number.
   - This function is correct and works as expected.

### Evaluation

- **Pre-computation:** The program precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000. This is done once and stored in `A`. This approach is efficient because it avoids recomputing the sum of digits for each number during each test case.
- **Test Case Handling:** For each test case, the program correctly retrieves the precomputed sum from `A` and prints it. This ensures that the solution is fast and accurate.
- **Functionality:** The `func_1` function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of any given number.

### Conclusion

The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It efficiently handles the precomputation and test case processing.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
