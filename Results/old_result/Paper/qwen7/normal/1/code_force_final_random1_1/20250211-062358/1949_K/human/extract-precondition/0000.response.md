Precondition: **num is an integer representing one of the positive integers from the input list, and na, nb, nc are non-negative integers such that 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2 and na + nb + nc = n. Additionally, group_a, group_b, and group_c are initially empty lists, and sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are initially zero integers.**
