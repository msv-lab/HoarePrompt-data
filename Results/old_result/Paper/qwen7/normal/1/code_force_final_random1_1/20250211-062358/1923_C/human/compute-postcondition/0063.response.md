Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(), `m` is 0, `a` is the same as the last value of `a` from the previous iteration, `b` is the same as the last value of `b` from the previous iteration, `i` is the same as the last value of `i` from the previous iteration, `s` is the same as the last value of `s` from the previous iteration, `p` is a list containing 0, `c` is a list containing 0.**

The code initializes `c` as a list containing 0. This does not affect the values of `l`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `p`, or their relationships. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
