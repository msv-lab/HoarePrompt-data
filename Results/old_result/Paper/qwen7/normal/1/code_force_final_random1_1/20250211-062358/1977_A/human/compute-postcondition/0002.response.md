Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split.**

The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
