Postcondition: **`ans` is equal to `ans` + 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of integers, `curr` is equal to the count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values`, and `cnt_b` reflects the decremented counts of these elements as long as they remain non-negative. The condition `curr >= k` is true.**
