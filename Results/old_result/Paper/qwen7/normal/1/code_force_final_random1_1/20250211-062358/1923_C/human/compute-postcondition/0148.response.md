Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m)`. The only variables involved here are `m` and `_`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not hold any specific value; it is used as a loop counter.
   - The variable `m` determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. Since `_` is just a loop counter, its initial value does not affect the loop execution directly.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: To ensure the loop can execute, `m` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` being greater than 0.

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
