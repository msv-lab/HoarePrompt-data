Postcondition: `j` is within the range 1 to n, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` is either 'S' followed by the original value of `nx` (if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`), or 'F' concatenated with the previous value of `nx` (if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`).
