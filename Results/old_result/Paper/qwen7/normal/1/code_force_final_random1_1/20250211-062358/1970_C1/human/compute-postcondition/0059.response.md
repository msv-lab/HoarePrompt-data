Output State: **`tree[current]` is not empty (excluding the previously processed `neighbor`), `visited` includes the previously processed `neighbor` and the new `neighbor`, `queue` includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.

The code `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means the `visited` set now includes both the previously processed `neighbor` and the new `neighbor`. All other variables remain unchanged.
