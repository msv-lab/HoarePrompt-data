You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5. It calculates the sum of all digits of `num` and stores it in variable `a`. After processing, the function returns the value of `a`. If `num` is initially 0, the function returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Pre-computation:**
   ```python
   A = []
   sum = 0
   for i in range(1, 200001):
       a = func_1(i)
       sum = sum + a
       A.append(sum)
   ```
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - It stores these sums in the list `A`.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficient for the precomputation step.

2. **Reading Test Cases:**
   ```python
   for t in range(int(input())):
       n = int(input())
       print(A[n - 1])
   ```
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and prints `A[n - 1]`.
   - This correctly retrieves the precomputed sum for the numbers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1(num):
       a = 0
       while num != 0:
           a = a + num % 10
           num = int(num / 10)
       return a
   ```
   - The function `func_1` computes the sum of the digits of a number.
   - This function is correct and works as expected.

### Evaluation

- **Pre-computation:** The program precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000. This is done once and stored in `A`. This approach is efficient because it avoids recomputing the sum of digits for each number during each test case.
- **Test Case Handling:** For each test case, the program correctly retrieves the precomputed sum from `A` and prints it. This ensures that the solution is fast and accurate.
- **Functionality:** The `func_1` function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of any given number.

### Conclusion

The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It efficiently handles the precomputation and test case processing.
