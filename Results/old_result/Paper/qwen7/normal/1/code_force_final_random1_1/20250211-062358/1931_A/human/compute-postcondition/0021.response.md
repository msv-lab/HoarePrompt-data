Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'aaa'.**

Explanation: The code `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` concatenates the string `'aa'` with the character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` list (assuming `alphabet` is a predefined list of characters like `['a', 'b', 'c', ...]`). Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact character added, but we know it is the third character before `n` in the `alphabet` list. However, since the initial state of `word` is an empty string, after adding `'aa'` followed by one more character, `word` becomes `'aaa'`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
