Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in lst:`. The key variables here are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop body effect**: The loop body updates `mini` to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, where `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `mini` is updated based on the current `ele`.
   - For the next iteration, `ele` will be the next element in the list `lst`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `mini` will be updated again based on the next `ele`.
   - `ele` will change to the next element in the list `lst`.
   - `lst` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

- `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value (which is the result of the previous iteration) and `abs(pk - ele)`, where `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`.
- `ele` will be the next element in the list `lst`.
- `lst` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` where `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`, `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`, `lst` is the same list**.
