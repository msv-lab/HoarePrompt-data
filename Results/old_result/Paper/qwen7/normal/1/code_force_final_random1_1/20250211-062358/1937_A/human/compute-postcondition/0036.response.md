Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 5, and `power` is 6**.

The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
