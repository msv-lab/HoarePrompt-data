Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" across all test cases and prints the sum of these counts. However, the goal is to minimize the number of deletions required to make the string beautiful, not to count the occurrences of "map" and "pie".

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through the string and remove the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears in the string. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**
