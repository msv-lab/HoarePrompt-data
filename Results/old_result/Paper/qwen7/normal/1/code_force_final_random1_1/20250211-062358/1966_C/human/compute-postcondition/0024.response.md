Output State: **`dp` is a boolean value determined by `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the current `dp` value.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the current `dp` value. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `arr[i]`, `arr[i + 1]`, or the initial value of `dp`, the updated value of `dp` depends on the outcome of the condition. If the condition is true, `dp` will be set to `True`. Otherwise, `dp` will be set to the negation of its current value.
