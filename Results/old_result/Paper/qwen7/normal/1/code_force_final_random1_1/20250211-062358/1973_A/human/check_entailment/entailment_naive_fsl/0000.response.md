Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for certain inputs. For instance, consider the input `(1, 1, 10)`:

- According to the problem description, the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.
- The program calculates the total points and checks if they are even and if the total matches fit within the constraints.
- However, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the maximum number of draws can exceed the number of matches played.

For the input `(1, 1, 10)`, the program incorrectly returns `2` as the maximum number of draws. The correct calculation should consider that with `p3 = 10`, the maximum number of draws is `8` (since each draw gives 1 point to both players, and `10 - 2 = 8`).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the calculated number of draws does not exceed the number of matches played and that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.
