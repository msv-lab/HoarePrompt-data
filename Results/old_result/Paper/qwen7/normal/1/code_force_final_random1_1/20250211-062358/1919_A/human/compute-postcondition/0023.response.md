Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes values for t, a, and b where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers between 1 and 10^9. The function returns different outputs based on the values of a and b for each test case.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any direct parameters when called. Instead, it seems to handle multiple test cases internally, each defined by values of `a` and `b` within specified ranges, along with a count `t` indicating the number of such test cases. The exact nature of the output for each test case (which could be a comparison result, a calculation, etc.) is not specified here, only the constraints on the input values.
