Output State: **`best` is `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `res`. Since the initial state specifies that if `res` equals '<', no change occurs, the value of `res` remains an input string. The values of `best`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
