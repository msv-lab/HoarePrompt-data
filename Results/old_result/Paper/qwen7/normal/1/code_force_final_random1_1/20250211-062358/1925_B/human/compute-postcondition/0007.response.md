Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be a positive integer, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. The expression `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i`; `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is a divisor of `x` and satisfies the given conditions, `ans` is now at least as large as `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
