You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each move you made are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two rooks share the same row or column after each move and its mirrored move by the computer.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: Output State: `dp` is a list where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[4]` is 11, `dp[5]` is 29, `dp[6]` is 17, `dp[7]` is 89, `dp[8]` is 239, `dp[9]` is 719, `dp[10]` is 2081, and so on until `dp[n]` is calculated for the maximum `n` which is \(3 \times 10^5\), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), and `i` is greater than `n`.
    #
    #This output state represents the final state of the `dp` array after the loop has executed for all iterations up to `n`, with the given recurrence relation applied. The values in `dp` follow the pattern defined by the loop, starting from the initial conditions provided and extending up to the maximum possible value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, representing the size of a board, and ensures that the input conditions are valid for further operations.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
