### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components and logic of the program. Let's break down the program and verify each part:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of the grid `n` for each test case.
   - The string `s` representing the grid is read correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results:
     - `A` stores the time taken for a pinball starting from the leftmost position to reach each position.
     - `B` stores the time taken for a pinball starting from the rightmost position to reach each position.

3. **Calculating `A`**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - When a `>` is encountered, it updates the value in `A` based on the previous value and the distance covered so far.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the positions where `>` is encountered.

4. **Calculating `B`**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - When a `<` is encountered, it updates the value in `B` based on the previous value and the distance covered so far.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the positions where `<` is encountered.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The main logic for calculating the time taken for a pinball starting at each position is implemented in the nested loops.
   - The program uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time taken for each position.
   - It handles different cases based on whether the current character is `>` or `<`, and whether the position is closer to the left or right boundary.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where the pinball starts from the leftmost or rightmost position.
   - For example, if the pinball starts at the leftmost position and encounters a `>`, it will move to the right until it leaves the grid.

2. **Intermediate Results**:
   - The intermediate results stored in `A` and `B` are correctly updated based on the rules provided.
   - The logic for updating `A` and `B` ensures that the time taken is accurately calculated for each position.

3. **Final Calculation Logic**:
   - The final calculation logic seems to handle all cases correctly, including the interactions between `A` and `B` values.
   - The program correctly accounts for the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as all characters being the same (`<` or `>`), or the grid being very long.
   - For example, if all characters are `>`, the pinball will move to the right until it leaves the grid, and the time taken will be the length of the grid minus the starting position.

### Conclusion

After a detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The calculations are performed accurately using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
