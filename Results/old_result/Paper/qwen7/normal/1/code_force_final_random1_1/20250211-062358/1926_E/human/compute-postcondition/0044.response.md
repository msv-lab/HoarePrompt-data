Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [], `k` is less than or equal to 4, `pow` is 8, `tot` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The line `L = []` reassigns the list `L` to an empty list. All other variables (`a`, `k`, `pow`, `tot`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
