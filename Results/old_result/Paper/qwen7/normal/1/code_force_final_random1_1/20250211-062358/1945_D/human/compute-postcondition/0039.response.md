Output State: **`total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `v` is an integer such that `v = v - 1`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `best`, and `total` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`v`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `best`) remain unchanged according to the initial postcondition. The value of `v` is updated to `v - 1` as per the initial postcondition.
