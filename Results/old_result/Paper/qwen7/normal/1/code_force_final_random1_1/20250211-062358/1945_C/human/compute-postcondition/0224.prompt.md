Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `final` is an empty list, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its final value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `pk` is an integer, `elem` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, and `final` contains the element `elem`. This is because if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is set to `elem`. There is no else part, so no additional conditions are applied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `pk` is an integer, `elem` is an integer (next element in `lst`), `mini` is an integer, and `final` is a list containing the element `elem`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `pk` is an integer, `elem` is the next integer in `lst`, `mini` is an integer, and `final` is a list containing the element `elem` and an additional element `elem`, unless `abs(pk - elem) != mini`, in which case `final` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
