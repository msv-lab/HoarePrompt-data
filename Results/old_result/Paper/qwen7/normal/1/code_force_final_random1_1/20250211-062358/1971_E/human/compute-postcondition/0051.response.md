Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is 1.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(b[s], end=' ')`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the meaning of `b[s]`. The `bisect_left` function returns the index where the value `ql` should be inserted into the sorted list `a` to maintain the sorted order. This index is then used to access the corresponding element in the list `b`.

However, since the exact lists `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `b[s]` in terms of the index `s` returned by `bisect_left`.

Given the information, the print statement will output the element in list `b` at the index specified by `s`.

Output: **b[s]**
