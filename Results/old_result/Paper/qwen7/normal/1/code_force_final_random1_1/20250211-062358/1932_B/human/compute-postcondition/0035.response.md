Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ai in a:`. This means the loop variables are `ai` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element.
   - `ai` is the next element in the list.
   - `year` is updated as `year + year % ai or ai`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, after processing `ai`, the next element in the list `a` becomes the new value of `ai`.
   - The list `a` will lose its first element (the one just processed), so it will now have one less element.
   - The variable `year` is updated based on the current `ai`, but since we are moving to the next iteration, we don't need to explicitly state the updated `year` value unless it changes significantly (which it doesn't in this context).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` must have at least one element remaining.
   - `ai` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `year` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `ai` is the next element in the list, `year` is `year + year % ai or ai`, `n` is an input integer**
