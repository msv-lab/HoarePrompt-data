Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` remains the same (indicating no condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` was met), and the length of `lis` is either odd or even depending on the path taken through the if-else block.**
