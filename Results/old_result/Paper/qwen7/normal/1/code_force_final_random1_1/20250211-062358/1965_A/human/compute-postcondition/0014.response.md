Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `set_`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `not_c` is True
   - `A` is True
   - `i` is 1
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(set_) - 1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(set_)`.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `len(set_)` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` should be set to 2.
   - `set_` must have more than 2 elements for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`not_c` is True, `A` is True, `i` is 2, `set_` must have more than 2 elements**
