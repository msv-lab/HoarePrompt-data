Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to an integer input from the user, but it does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the other variables remain unchanged.
