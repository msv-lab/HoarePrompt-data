Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 2, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the next character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is the first character of the string `s` plus the next character in `s`.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the value of `cur` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
