Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `s` is a new input string with a length at least 2, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, and `j` is incremented by 1 and is now less than or equal to `len(s) - 2`**.

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3.
- The variable `s` remains a new input string with a minimum length of 2.
- The variable `count` is 3, indicating that there were no changes in consecutive characters during the loop's execution.
- The variable `flag` remains True as long as the condition `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'` was met at any point during the loop's execution.
- The variable `j` is incremented by 1 each iteration until it is no longer less than or equal to `len(s) - 2`.
