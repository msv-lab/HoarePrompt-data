Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will be updated such that for every index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` will be the sum of `a[0]` (which is initially 1000) and the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`.

This means that `a[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `x`, starting from 1000. For example, if `x = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 4`, then after the loop, `a` will be `[1000, 1001, 1004, 1008]`.
