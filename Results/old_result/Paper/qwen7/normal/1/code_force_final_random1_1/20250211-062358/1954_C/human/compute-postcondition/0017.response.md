Output State: **`i` is 4, `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, `new[3]` is equal to `max(a[3], b[3])`, `new2[3]` is equal to `min(a[3], b[3])`, and `len(new2)` is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 3, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 4. The values of `a[3]`, `b[3]`, `new[3]`, `new2[3]`, and `len(new2)` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code.
