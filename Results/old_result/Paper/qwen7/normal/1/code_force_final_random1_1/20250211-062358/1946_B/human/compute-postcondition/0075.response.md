Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `suf` is updated such that its i-th element is now the sum of its i-th element and `l[i]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `i` must be less than `n` for the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be at least 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `suf` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `n` must still be at least 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`suf` is updated such that its i-th element is now the sum of its i-th element and `l[i]`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be at least 1**.
