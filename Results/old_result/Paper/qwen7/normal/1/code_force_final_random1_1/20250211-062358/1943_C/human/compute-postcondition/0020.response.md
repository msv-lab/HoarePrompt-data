Output State: **All elements in the list `u2vs` will contain pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between indices. The final state of `u2vs` will be such that for every pair `(u, v)` entered through the loop, both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will contain each other.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `u2vs` will represent a fully connected graph where each node (index) is connected to every other node that was specified in the input. Each list in `u2vs` will contain all the indices that are directly connected to the index represented by the list's position.
