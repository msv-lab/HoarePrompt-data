Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `new2[i]` to be the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. The initial conditions for `i`, `new`, and `new2` remain unchanged except for the modification to `new2[i]`.
