Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, and `array2` contains an element equal to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` an element calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the line of code, `i` is incremented to 2. The element appended to `array2` is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, which is a specific calculation based on the values of `arr[1]`, `arr[0]`, and `a`. The precondition that `n` is at least 2 remains unchanged.
