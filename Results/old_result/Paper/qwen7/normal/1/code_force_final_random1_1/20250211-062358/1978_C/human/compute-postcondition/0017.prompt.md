You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}, and k is even if n is odd.
def func_4():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros (0, 0)
    #State: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12} and k is odd if n is odd
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. If `n` is odd, `k` is odd and `max_k` is set to \( n \). If `n` is even, `k` is even and `max_k` is set to \( n \).
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values, both of which are 0.
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `k` is an integer where \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\); `max_k` is set to \(n\).
    return n, k
    #The program returns n, which is an integer between 1 and 200000, and k, which is an integer between 0 and 1000000000000.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either two zeros (0, 0), or an integer n between 1 and 200000 and an integer k between 0 and 1000000000000.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns two zeros (0, 0)

Case_2: The program returns two values, both of which are 0.

Case_3: The program returns n, which is an integer between 1 and 200000, and k, which is an integer between 0 and 1000000000000.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
