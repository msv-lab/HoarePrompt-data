Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `r` is equal to `r - 1`. Since `r` is set to `r - 1`, this implies that `r` is one less than its previous value. Given that `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and since `r` is now one less than its previous value, it means `l` must have been equal to `r` before this operation. So, let's assume `r` was initially `k`, then `r` is now `k - 1` and `l` is `k`.

2. **Calculating `a`:**
   - `a` is defined as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - Since `l` is `k`, `l - 1` is `k - 1`.
   - Therefore, `a = A[k - 1] + (1 - idx_A[k - 1]) * k`.

3. **Calculating `b`:**
   - `b` is defined as `B[r] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1) - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
   - Since `r` is `k - 1` and `l` is `k`, `r - l` is `-1`.
   - Therefore, `b = B[k - 1] + (1 - idx_A[k - 1]) * k - B[k - 1 - k] - (idx_B[k - 1 - k] - 1) * (-1) + (idx_B[k - 1] - 1) * k`.
   - Simplifying further, `b = B[k - 1] + (1 - idx_A[k - 1]) * k - B[-1] - (idx_B[-1] - 1) * (-1) + (idx_B[k - 1] - 1) * k`.
   - Assuming `B[-1]` and `idx_B[-1]` are not defined or considered zero for simplicity, `b` simplifies to `B[k - 1] + (1 - idx_A[k - 1]) * k + (idx_B[k - 1] - 1) * k`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - We need to calculate `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the values of `a` and `b`, we get:
     \[
     a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 = 2 \left( A[k - 1] + (1 - idx_A[k - 1]) * k \right) + 2 \left( B[k - 1] + (1 - idx_A[k - 1]) * k + (idx_B[k - 1] - 1) * k \right) + 1 + 1
     \]
     \[
     = 2A[k - 1] + 2(1 - idx_A[k - 1])k + 2B[k - 1] + 2(1 - idx_A[k - 1])k + 2(idx_B[k - 1] - 1)k + 2 + 1 + 1
     \]
     \[
     = 2A[k - 1] + 2B[k - 1] + 2(1 - idx_A[k - 1])k + 2(1 - idx_A[k - 1])k + 2(idx_B[k - 1] - 1)k + 4
     \]
     \[
     = 2A[k - 1] + 2B[k - 1] + 4(1 - idx_A[k - 1])k + 2(idx_B[k - 1] - 1)k + 4
     \]

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`, the expression cannot be simplified further without these values. However, the structure of the expression is clear.

Output: **2A[k - 1] + 2B[k - 1] + 4(1 - idx_A[k - 1])k + 2(idx_B[k - 1] - 1)k + 4**
