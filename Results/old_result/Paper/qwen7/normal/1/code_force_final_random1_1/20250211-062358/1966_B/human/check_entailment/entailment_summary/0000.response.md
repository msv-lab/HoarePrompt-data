Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Grid Initialization**: It initializes the grid `gr` and reads the grid from the input.
3. **Initial Color Check**: The program first checks if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are the same color. If they are different, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
4. **Row and Column Checks**: 
   - It then checks if all cells in the first row are the same color.
   - It also checks if all cells in the last column are the same color.
   - If either of these checks fails, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The check for `impossible` being true when all cells in the first row or last column are the same color is unnecessary and incorrect. This approach does not cover all scenarios where the grid can be made uniform.
- The program should consider the entire grid, not just the first row and last column.

To properly determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color, the program should check if the entire grid can be unified through the allowed operations. The current implementation is insufficient and may lead to incorrect results.

Given these points, the provided program is **not** correct for solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
