To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition and the current values of the relevant variables.

### Loop Head Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while count <= m:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`.

### Current Values
- `countmins` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is an input integer (not directly affecting the loop condition)
- `m` must be at least 4 (relevant to the loop condition)
- `count` is 4 (relevant to the loop condition)
- `ans` is a computed value (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `g` is `int(n / 3)` (not relevant to the loop condition)

### Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`. Given that `count` is currently 4, `m` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State
- `count` is 4, so it needs to remain 4.
- `m` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` must be at least 5.

### Final Answer
State: **`countmins` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 3) / 3) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 3)`**
