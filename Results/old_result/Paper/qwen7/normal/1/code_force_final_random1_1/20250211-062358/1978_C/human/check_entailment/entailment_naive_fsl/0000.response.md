Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation based on the given `n` and `k`, but it does not cover all possible scenarios, particularly when `k` is odd or when the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) is less than `k`.

Here are some specific issues:

1. **Handling Odd `k`:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the case when `k` is odd. Since the Manhattan value is always even (as it is the sum of absolute differences), the function should not attempt to construct a permutation when `k` is odd.

2. **Handling Maximum Possible Manhattan Value:**
   - The function `func_4` calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`). If `max_k` is less than `k`, the function returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists. However, the main function `func_6` does not properly handle this case and continues to call `func_1`, which may lead to incorrect behavior.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3 5
```
- The maximum possible Manhattan value for `n = 3` is `2` (since `|1-1| + |2-2| + |3-3| = 0` and the next highest is `|1-1| + |2-3| + |3-2| = 2`).
- Since `5 > 2`, the function should return "No". However, the current implementation may incorrectly attempt to construct a permutation, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is marked as **False**.
