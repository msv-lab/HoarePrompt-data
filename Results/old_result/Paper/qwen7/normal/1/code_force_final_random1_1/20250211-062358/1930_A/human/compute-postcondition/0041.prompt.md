Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    score = 0
    for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
        score += l[i]
    print(score)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The value of `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, up to the last element that can be accessed within the loop's range. Specifically, `score` is the sum of `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2*n-2]`, provided that `n` is greater than 0.

This means that `score` will contain the sum of all even-indexed elements (considering the list indexing starts at 0) from the list `l`, as long as there are enough elements to complete the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 2 * n - 1, `score` is the original `score` plus the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (n - 1).

In Natural Language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `2 * n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `score` will be the original value of `score` plus the sum of elements from the list `l` at even indices, specifically `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, and so on, up to `l[2 * (n - 1)]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The final value of `score` will be the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element and going up to the last element in steps of 2*(n-1). The variable `i` will be set to `2*n-1` after the loop finishes, and `l` will remain unchanged.

This means that `score` will contain the sum of elements `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2*(n-1)]` if such elements exist in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
