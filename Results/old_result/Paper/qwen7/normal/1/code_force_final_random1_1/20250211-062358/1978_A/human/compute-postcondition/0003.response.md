Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `nums`. The variables `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
