Output State: **`B` is a list where if `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is [0]. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`; `idx_B` is `[i]`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors; `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`; `j` is 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; the current value of `s[i]` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to `idx_B`. Since `j` is 0 and `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `i` is `n - 1`. The value of `s[i]` is '<', which means no changes are made to `B` or other variables. Therefore, the only change is in `idx_B`, which now contains the index `i`.
