Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the new list `b` is created based on the input provided by the user. The initial state of `t` is preserved, and `b` now holds the integers from the user's input.
