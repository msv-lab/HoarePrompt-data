Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will each contain `n` integers, which are the integers entered by the user during each iteration of the loop. The variable `coef` remains unchanged, consisting of `n` elements all set to `None`. The `visited` list remains unchanged, containing `n` boolean values, all set to `False`.

This means that for each index `j` from `0` to `n-1`, `x[j]`, `y[j]`, and `r[j]` will hold the integer values provided by the user on the `j`th iteration of the loop.
