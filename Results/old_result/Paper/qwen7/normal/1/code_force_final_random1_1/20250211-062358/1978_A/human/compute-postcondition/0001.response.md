State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_` is used in the loop head, but it is typically an internal counter that starts from 0. It does not need to be explicitly adjusted since it will automatically be set to 0 when the loop begins.
2. The variable `t` is defined as an integer input, and it determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
3. Since the loop body is omitted, no other variables or states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `t` must be a positive integer within the given range.
