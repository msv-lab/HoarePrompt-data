Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The final value of `i` will be `len(a)`. This means that `q` should be set to `len(a)` because the loop runs from `0` to `q-1`.
   - The variable `l` will take on values from `0` to `q-1` during the loop iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `l < q`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop runs until `l < q`, `q` must be set to `len(a)` to ensure the loop runs correctly.
   - The variable `l` will start at `0` and increment by `1` in each iteration, but its initial value before the loop starts is `0`.

5. **Consider the given information about `v`**:
   - The list `v` is defined as `[ad[2] / bd[2], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`. This information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head state but ensures that the loop body can operate correctly once the loop starts.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `q` and `l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`q` is `len(a)`, `l` is `0`**
