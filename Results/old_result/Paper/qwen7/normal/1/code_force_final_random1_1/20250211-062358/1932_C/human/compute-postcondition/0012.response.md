Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `b` is a list. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'L', then `b` contains one element which is `a[l]`, and `l` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains one element `a[r-1]` appended to it.
