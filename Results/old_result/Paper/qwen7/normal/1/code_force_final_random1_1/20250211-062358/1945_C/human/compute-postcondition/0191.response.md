Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`. However, `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the state at the end of the previous iteration. We need to determine how `i` and `n` are related.

2. **Analyze the Given Conditions**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `zero` is 2.
   - `zero_perc` is 50.
   - `one_perc` is -66.67.
   - The condition for `lst` to be `[3]` is that both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` must be greater than or equal to 50.

3. **Check the Condition**:
   - `zero_perc` is 50, which meets the condition.
   - `one_perc` is -66.67, which does not meet the condition.

Since the condition for `lst` to be `[3]` is not met (because `one_perc` is not greater than or equal to 50), the values of `i`, `zero`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is 2, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 3.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is -66.67, `n` must be greater than 2**
