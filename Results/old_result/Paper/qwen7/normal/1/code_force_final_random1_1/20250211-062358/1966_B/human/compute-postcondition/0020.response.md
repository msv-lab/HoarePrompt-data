Postcondition: `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, and `impossible` remains False. If the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the nth row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the nth row in `gr`, then `impossible` remains False.
