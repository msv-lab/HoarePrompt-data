### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a certain number of stones from each non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the game state can be simplified by considering the parity (even or odd) of the number of piles with a specific number of stones. Specifically, if the number of piles with exactly one stone is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Analyzed Code**:
   - The code reads the input and calls `func_1` with the array `arr`.
   - In `func_1`, the code first checks if the first element of `arr` is not 1. If true, it immediately returns 'Alice'.
   - Otherwise, it converts `arr` to a set to get unique values and sorts them.
   - It then iterates through the sorted unique values to check the gaps between consecutive values. If any gap is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to `False`.
   - The variable `A` alternates between `True` and `False` based on the iteration index.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' otherwise.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the number of piles with exactly one stone is even or odd.
   - If the first element is not 1, it correctly returns 'Alice'.
   - The loop logic correctly handles the alternating `A` value and the `not_c` flag.
   - The final return statement correctly determines the winner based on the conditions.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
