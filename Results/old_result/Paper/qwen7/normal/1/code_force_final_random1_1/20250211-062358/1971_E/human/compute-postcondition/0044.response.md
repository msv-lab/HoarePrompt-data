Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` to its current value, which was `b[s - 1]`. The values of `i`, `l`, `ql`, `bd`, `s`, and `ad` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
