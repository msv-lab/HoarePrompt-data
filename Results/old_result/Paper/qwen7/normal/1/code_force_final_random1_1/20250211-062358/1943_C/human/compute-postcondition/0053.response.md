Output State: **`i` is 1; `ci` is 1; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 1)` where `c` is the current value of `ci`.**

In this case, the code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `ci` is 1, and assuming `c` refers to `ci`, the list `ops` now contains a single tuple with `c` (which is `ci`) and `i`.
