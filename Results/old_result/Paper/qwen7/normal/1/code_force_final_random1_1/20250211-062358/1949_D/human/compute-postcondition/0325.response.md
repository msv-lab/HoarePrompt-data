Output State: **`nx` is 'FS', `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The initial state has `nx` being either 'S' or 'F', and `j` is incremented by 1. The code `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the current value of `nx`. Since `nx` could initially be either 'S' or 'F', appending 'S' to it results in 'FS' or 'FS'. The value of `j` remains as `j + 1` from its initial state.
