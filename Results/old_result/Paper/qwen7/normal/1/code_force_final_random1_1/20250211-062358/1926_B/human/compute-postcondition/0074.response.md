Output State: **After all iterations, `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's across all input strings provided during the loop executions. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the condition inside the if block is true, and 'SQUARE' is printed for each iteration. Otherwise, the condition inside the else block is executed, and 'TRIANGLE' is printed for each iteration.**

In this final state, `k` will contain the cumulative count of '1's from all the input strings provided over all iterations of the loop. Depending on whether the first and second elements of `k` are equal, either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' will be printed for each iteration.
