Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`.**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 1, and `a[i]` remains an integer value from `data[idx]`.
