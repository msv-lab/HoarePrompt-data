Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer input, and `b` is the second integer input. If both `a` and `b` are even, the postcondition remains as per the if part. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and the following conditions hold: 
- If `a` is even, then `a - b == -a`.
- If `b` is even, then `b - a == -b`.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then the difference between `a` and `b` is not equal to zero and satisfies `(a - b) % 2 != 0`.
- If the difference between `a` and `b` is zero, then it satisfies `(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
