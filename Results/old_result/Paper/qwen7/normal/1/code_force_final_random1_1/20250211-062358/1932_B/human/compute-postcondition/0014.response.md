The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_`, `t`, and `n`. However, since `_` is a dummy variable used for iteration, it does not affect the state. The variables `t` and `n` are the ones that can be adjusted.

Given that the loop is iterating `t` times and `n` is the initial number of iterations, at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since the problem states that the final value of `year` will be the sum of all elements in the list `a`, this information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head variables. We only need to focus on `t` and `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
