Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(a)`, meaning `i` is the length of the list `a`.
- `new` is a list containing the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices.
- `new2` is a list containing the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices.

The `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))` statement will join all elements of the list `new2` into a single string, converting each element to a string before joining.

Since the exact lists `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `new2`. However, we know that each element in `new2` is the maximum of the corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output will be a string formed by concatenating the string representations of the elements in `new2`.

Output: **a string formed by concatenating the string representations of the elements in new2**
