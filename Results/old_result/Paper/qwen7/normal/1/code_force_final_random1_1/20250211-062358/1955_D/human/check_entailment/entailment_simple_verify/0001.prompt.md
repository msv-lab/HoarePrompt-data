You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program aims to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` of length `m`, where at least `k` elements match the elements of array `b`.
2. The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m` and counts how many of these subsegments are good.
3. It initializes a counter array `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
4. For each test case, it processes the input values:
   - Reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Reads the elements of `a` and `b`.
   - Updates the `cnt_b` array with the frequencies of elements in `b`.
5. It then iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` to initialize the current count of matching elements (`curr`).
6. If the initial count of matching elements (`curr`) is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer (`ans`).
7. Using a sliding window, it moves through the rest of the array `a`:
   - Removes the element that is sliding out of the window from the count.
   - Adds the new element entering the window to the count.
   - Checks if the current count of matching elements (`curr`) is greater than or equal to `k` and updates the answer accordingly.
8. Finally, it prints the answer for each test case and resets the `cnt_b` array for the next test case.

Given the logic and implementation, the program correctly implements the sliding window technique to count the number of good subsegments.
