Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input, `m` is `m + 1`, `a` and `b` are updated based on the new input, `i` and `s` are recalculated using the updated `a` and `b`, `p` and `c` are updated to reflect the new cumulative values.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `l`. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `p`, and `c`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
