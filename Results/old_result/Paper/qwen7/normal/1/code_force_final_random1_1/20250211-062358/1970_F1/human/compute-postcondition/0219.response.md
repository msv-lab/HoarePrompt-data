Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings read from stdin, `time` is incremented by 1. If the length of `command` is 3, then `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` equals '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If the length of `command` is not 3, then `command` is updated to ('obj', 'com'), `time` is incremented by 1, `pos` is updated to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`, and if `obj` is a player and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true or `obj` is not a player but `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then `player` is determined based on whether `obj` is a player or not, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If the command is 'T' and the goalIn(pos) is not -1, then the team corresponding to the goal position has its points incremented by 1.
