Output State: The value of `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, determined by the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]` when `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, and by `a_values[y]` otherwise. If `y` reaches 1 during the loop, `custo` is further incremented by `a_values[0]`.

This final state represents the total accumulated cost based on the specified conditions over all iterations of the loop until `y` is no longer greater than 0.
