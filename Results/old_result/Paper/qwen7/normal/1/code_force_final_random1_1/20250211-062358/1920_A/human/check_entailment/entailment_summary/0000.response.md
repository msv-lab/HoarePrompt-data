Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. These constraints are of three types: \( k \geq x \), \( k \leq x \), and \( k \neq x \).
- The given solution correctly handles these constraints by:
  - Reading the number of constraints \( n \) and initializing the range for \( k \) (\( start \) and \( end \)).
  - Iterating over each constraint and updating the range based on the type of constraint.
  - Handling the exclusion of specific values (type 3 constraints) by checking if they fall within the current range.
  - Adjusting the final count based on whether the range is valid and the number of excluded values.

Given the detailed execution summary of `func_7`, it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function correctly updates the range and counts the valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the overall implementation meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
