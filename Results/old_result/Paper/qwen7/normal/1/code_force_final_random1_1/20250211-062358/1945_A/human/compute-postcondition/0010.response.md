Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer from `s`, `b` is the second integer from `s` plus the third integer from `s`, and `c` is the third integer from `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated by adding `c` to it. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` now holds the sum of its original value and `c`.
