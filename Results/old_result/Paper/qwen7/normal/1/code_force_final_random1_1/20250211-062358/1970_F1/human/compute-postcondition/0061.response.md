Postcondition: `ind` is incremented by 1, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, and `ind` is less than `len(line)`, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1, and `line[ind][1]` is either 'G' or not 'G'.
