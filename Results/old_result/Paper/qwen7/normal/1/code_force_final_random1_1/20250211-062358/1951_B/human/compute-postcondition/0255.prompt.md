Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in `s` have been iterated over, `i` is now the last element of the original list `s`. `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` plus one if the first element was not `h`. `z` is 1 if the last element of the original list `s` is equal to `h`, otherwise `z` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in the list `s` have been iterated over. The variable `i` has taken the value of each element in the list `s` once. The variable `ans1` is incremented by 1 for each element that is equal to `h` or for the first element of `s` if it is not equal to `h`. The variable `z` remains unchanged unless the first element of `s` is equal to `h`, in which case it becomes 1. The list `s` is modified such that the first and last elements have swapped positions, and any element equal to `h` or the first element (if it's not equal to `h`) will increment `ans1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `s` have been iterated over, `i` is now the last element of `s` (or the last element that was compared against `h`), `ans` contains the count of elements in `s` from the second element onwards that are not less than `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 each time `z` equals 1 and `i > h`, or by 1 if `s[0] != h` and `z` does not equal 1, `z` remains unchanged unless `i == h` and `s[0] != h`, in which case `z` is set to 1, `s[0]` and `s[k - 1]` have swapped values, and `s[p]` and `s[k - 1]` have swapped values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
