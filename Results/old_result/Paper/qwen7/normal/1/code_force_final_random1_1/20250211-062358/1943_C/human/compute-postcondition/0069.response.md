Output State: **`i` is 5, `c1` is unchanged, `ops` now contains the tuples (`c1`, 3), (`c2`, 1), (`c2`, 3), and (`c1`, 5)**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 5 and `c1` is unchanged (meaning `c1` retains its original value), the list `ops` now includes the additional tuple (`c1`, 5).
