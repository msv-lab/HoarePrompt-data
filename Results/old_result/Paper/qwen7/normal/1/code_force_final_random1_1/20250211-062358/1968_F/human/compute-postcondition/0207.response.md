Output State: **`pf[6]` is equal to `pf[5] ^ data[3] ^ a[6]`, `a[6]` is equal to `data[3]`, `idx` is `4`, `mp[pf[6]]` becomes a list containing `[6]` since `pf[6]` was not previously in `mp`.**

Explanation: The code appends the index `i` (which is `6`) to the list `mp[pf[6]]`. Since `pf[6]` was not previously in `mp`, `mp[pf[6]]` becomes an empty list and then gets appended with `6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
