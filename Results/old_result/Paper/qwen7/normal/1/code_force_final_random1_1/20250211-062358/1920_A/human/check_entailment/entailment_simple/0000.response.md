Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints and processes each constraint.
3. It handles constraints of type 1, 2, and 3 appropriately:
   - For type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates the `start` variable to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - For type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates the `end` variable to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - For type 3 (k must be not equal to x), it appends `x` to the `num` list.
4. After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints:
   - It counts how many numbers in `num` do not fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 (impossible constraints).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers as `end - start + 1 - count_num`.
5. The program correctly handles the constraints and outputs the number of valid integers for each test case.

Given the analysis, the program logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
