Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 2, `total` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `mp` is {(0): [0]}, `a` is a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros.**

The code initializes the dictionary `mp` with a single key-value pair `(0): [0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
