Output State: **`nx` is either 'Sxx[i][j - 1]' or 'Fxx[i][j - 1]' or 'SF' or 'FF', `j` is `j + 1`**.

Explanation:
- The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` concatenates the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the end of `nx`.
- Initially, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` changes to either 'Sxx[i][j - 1]' or 'Fxx[i][j - 1]'.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FF'.
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1.
