Output State: **The value of `i` remains 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, and `j` is equal to `n`. For each `j` from 1 to `n`, if `x[j-1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is increased by 1. If `x[j-1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (from 1 to `n`), the variable `i` will still be 1 because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is used only as the upper limit of the loop. The variable `j` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration of the loop. For each position `j` from 1 to `n`, depending on the character at `x[j-1]`, either `a[j]` or `b[j]` will have been incremented accordingly.
