Output State: **`y` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2` added to the original `custo` value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program exits the context where the `break` is placed. The values of `y` and `custo` remain unchanged from their initial states.
