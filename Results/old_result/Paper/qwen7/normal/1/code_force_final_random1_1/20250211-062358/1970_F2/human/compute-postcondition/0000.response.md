Output State: **a is split into two variables `x` and `y`, both holding the same integer value as `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = a` unpacks the tuple `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. Since `a` is a tuple containing two integers representing the dimensions of the field, `x` and `y` will each hold one of those integers. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
