Output State: **`countmins` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Initially, `count` was 2, so after executing this line, `count` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
