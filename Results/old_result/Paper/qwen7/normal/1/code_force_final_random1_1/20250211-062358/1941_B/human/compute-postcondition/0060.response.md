Postcondition: `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is 0, the values of `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]`, and `a[n - 1]` respectively, and either the last two elements of the list `a` are not both zero, or they are both zero, `numTest` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
