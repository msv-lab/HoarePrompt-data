Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `word` is "zzzzzz"**

Explanation: The code snippet `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` appends the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz' to the `word` string. Given that `n` is greater than 52, `n - 53` will be a non-negative integer between 0 and 47 (inclusive). Since the example does not specify the exact value of `n`, we consider the general case where `n - 53` results in a value within the valid range for indexing the `alphabet` list. However, without loss of generality and to provide a concrete answer, let's assume `n - 53` results in a value that corresponds to 'z' repeated 6 times ('zzzzzz'). Thus, `word` becomes 'zzzzzz'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the initial condition that `n` is greater than 52 still holds true.
