Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes the number of test cases (`t`) and the test cases themselves (`test_cases`).
2. The function `func_1` iterates over each test case, correctly extracting `n`, `m`, and the string `a`.
3. It calculates the frequency of each difficulty level using the `freq` array, which is correctly initialized and updated.
4. The logic to calculate the number of missing problems is correct. For each difficulty level, it checks if there are fewer problems available than required (`m - f < 0`), and if so, it adds the difference to the `missing` count.
5. The final result for each test case is correctly appended to the `results` list.
6. The function returns the `results` list, which contains the correct number of missing problems for each test case.

Given the provided example and the state of the program, the logic appears to be correct and matches the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
