Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is an input integer, and the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is equal to `tc` - 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element, `dp` is the result of applying the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` iteratively from `i = 1` to `i = n-1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `tc` is at least 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the previous value of `dp` for every `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, inclusive.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tc` is reduced by 1, `dp` will be the result of evaluating the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` or not `dp`, `i` will be `n-1`, `n` remains at least 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
