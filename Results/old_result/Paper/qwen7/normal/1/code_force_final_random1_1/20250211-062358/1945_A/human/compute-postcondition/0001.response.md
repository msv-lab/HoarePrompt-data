Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and there are exactly `t` lines of input, each containing three non-negative integers separated by spaces; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the current line of input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` takes a string `s` (which is part of the input) and splits it into parts based on spaces. It then converts these parts into integers and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the initial state specifies that there are exactly `t` lines of input, each containing three non-negative integers, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the integers from the current line of input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was defined before the code execution.
