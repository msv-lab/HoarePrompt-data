Reasoning:
- The program is designed to solve a specific problem involving counting ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions.
- The core function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given pair (n, m).
- The function `func_16()` reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case, calling `func_15()` to compute the result and writing it to the standard output.
- Given the problem statement and the provided functions, `func_15()` appears to correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs (a, b) based on the conditions specified.
- The input handling and output generation in `func_16()` match the problem requirements, and the functions `func_10()` and `func_7()` are correctly used to read the input for each test case.
- The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_15()`.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
