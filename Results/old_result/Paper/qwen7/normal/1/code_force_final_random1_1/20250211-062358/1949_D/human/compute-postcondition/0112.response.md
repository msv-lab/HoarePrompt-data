Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 24.
- `j` will be `n + 1`.
- `xx` is a list containing `n` arrays, each representing an input string `x`.
- For every index `k` from 1 to `n`, `a[k]` is incremented by the total number of 'F's across all input strings `x` up to index `k-1`.
- For every index `k` from 1 to `n`, `b[k]` is incremented by the total number of 'S's across all input strings `x` up to index `k-1`.
- `sa` is an empty list.
- `sb` is an empty list.

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `i`: This variable is initialized to 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.
- `n`: This variable is used as the upper limit for the range function.

### Required Adjustments:
1. **Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and ends when `i` becomes `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 1.
2. **Value of `n`**: The value of `n` should be within the specified range (2 to 24).
3. **Value of `j`**: The value of `j` is set to `n + 1` after the loop completes, so we need to ensure that `j` is not yet set to `n + 1` before the loop starts.

### Final State Adjustment:
Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` should be an integer between 2 and 24.
- `j` should not be equal to `n + 1`.

### State Adjustment:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`**
