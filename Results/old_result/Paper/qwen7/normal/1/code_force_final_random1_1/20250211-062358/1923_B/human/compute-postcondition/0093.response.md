Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` minus the total amount deducted from `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` during each iteration, `distance` is increased by 1, and `pos` is either increased by 1 for each zero value in `a[sorted_indices]` encountered or remains unchanged otherwise. The final value of `pos` will be the last index in `sorted_indices` where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was not reduced to 0, or it will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all elements were reduced to 0.**

Explanation: The line `distance += 1` increments the value of `distance` by 1. All other variables (`rest`, `pos`) remain in their respective conditions as described in the initial state.
