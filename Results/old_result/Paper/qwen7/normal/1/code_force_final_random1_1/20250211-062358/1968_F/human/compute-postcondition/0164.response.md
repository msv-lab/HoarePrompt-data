The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables but changes the flow of the loop. The conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES'**
