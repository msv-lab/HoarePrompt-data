The loop condition is `pos != len(sorted_indices)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `pos` must be different from `len(sorted_indices)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `distance` is 4
- `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined (indicating that `pos` is out of bounds)
- `rest` is 0

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `pos` must be different from `len(sorted_indices)`. Since `pos` is currently equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, we need to adjust `pos` to be something other than `len(sorted_indices)`.

Therefore, we can set `pos` to be any value that is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.

State: **`distance` is 4, `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined, and `rest` is 0**
