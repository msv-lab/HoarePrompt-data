Output State: **`i` is 0; `lk` must be greater than 1; `ans` contains the value 1**

Explanation: The code appends \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, \(2^0 = 1\). Therefore, `ans` now contains the value 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for `lk` remains the same.
