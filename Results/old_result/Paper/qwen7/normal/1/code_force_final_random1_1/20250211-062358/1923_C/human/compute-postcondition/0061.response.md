Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(), `m` is 0, `a` is the same as the last value of `a` from the previous iteration, `b` is the same as the last value of `b` from the previous iteration, `i` is the same as the last value of `i` from the previous iteration, `s` is the same as the last value of `s` from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `l`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their previous states.
