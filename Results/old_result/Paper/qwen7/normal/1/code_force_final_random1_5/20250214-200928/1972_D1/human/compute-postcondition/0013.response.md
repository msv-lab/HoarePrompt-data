Output State: `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) such that \(i^2 \leq n + i\), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\), and `n` must be a non-negative integer.

To break it down further:
- The loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\).
- For each iteration, `ans` is incremented by \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
- The loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.
- Once \(i^2 > n + i\), the loop terminates.
- Therefore, the final value of `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid `i` values, and `i` will be the smallest integer satisfying \(i^2 > n + i\).
