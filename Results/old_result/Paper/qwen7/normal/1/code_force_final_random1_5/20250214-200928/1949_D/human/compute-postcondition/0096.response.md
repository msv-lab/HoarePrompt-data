Postcondition: `x` is an array, `j` is `j + 1`. If `x[j - 1]` is equal to 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is equal to 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are each increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes are made to `a[i]`, `a[j]`, `b[i]`, and `b[j]`.
