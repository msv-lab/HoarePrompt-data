Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the new string input by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string input by the user, `b` is a sorted string of the new string input by the user, `c` is the sorted string of the new string input by the user in descending order. The values of these variables remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition `b == s` is true or false.***
