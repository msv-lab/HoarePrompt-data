Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, n and q are not yet defined as integers, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, and each query consists of l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input as a string, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `n`, `q`, and the list `a` remain unchanged and are not yet defined as integers. Each query's `l` and `r` values also remain undefined.
