Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, a is the integer input for the first test case.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. This input corresponds to the number of test cases (`t`). After executing this line, the value of `t` remains unchanged, but now `a` holds the value of the first test case's integer input. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 still holds, and the input for the subsequent test cases will be read later in the program.
