Output State: **`x` is an array where the element at index `j-1` is equal to 'F', and the element at index `i` is incremented by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` of the array `a` (assuming `a` is the same as `x` from the initial state) by 1. Since the initial state only specifies that the element at index `j-1` is 'F', and does not specify the value of `i`, the output state includes both the unchanged element at `j-1` and the updated element at `i`.
