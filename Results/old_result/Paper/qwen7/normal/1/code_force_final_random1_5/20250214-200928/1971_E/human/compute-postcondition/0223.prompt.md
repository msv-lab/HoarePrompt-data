Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; t is assigned the value of int(input()).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` set to `len(a)`, `q` still equal to `len(a)`, `l` equal to `len(a) - 1`, `s` determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, and `ql` adjusted based on user input and previous operations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will stop at the last valid index it could have been (one less than the length of `a`), `bd` will still hold the differences as calculated, and `v` will be a list of length `len(a)` where the first element is `0` and the rest are the results of dividing corresponding elements of `ad` by `bd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will execute `q` times. After all iterations, the variable `l` will be equal to `q-1`. The variable `m` will be the cumulative sum calculated over all iterations, which starts with `b[s - 1]` and adds `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration. The variable `i` remains 1 throughout the loop. The final value of `m` will be the sum of `b[s - 1]` plus the contributions from `bd[s]` scaled by `(ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `l` will be set to `q-1`, `i` will still be 1, and `m` will be the total accumulated value after processing all inputs, starting from `b[s - 1]` and adding the scaled values from `bd[s]` for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
