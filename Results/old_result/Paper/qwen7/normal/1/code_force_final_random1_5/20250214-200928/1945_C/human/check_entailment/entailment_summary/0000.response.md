Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and the binary string `s`.

2. **Calculating Percentages**: The program calculates the number of '0's and '1's in the string. It then iterates through the string to calculate the percentage of '0's and '1's up to each position. This part is crucial for determining if the conditions are met.

3. **Condition Checking**: The program checks if the percentage of '0's and '1's at each position meets the requirement of being at least 50%. If both conditions are met, it appends the position to the list `lst`.

4. **Finding Optimal Position**: After collecting all positions that meet the criteria, the program finds the position closest to `pk` (half the length of the string). If there are multiple such positions, it selects the smallest one.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no position meets the criteria, the program correctly handles the edge case by checking the majority count of '0's or '1's and returning either the start or end of the string accordingly.

6. **Output**: The program prints the optimal position.

Given the detailed explanation and the logic followed by the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
