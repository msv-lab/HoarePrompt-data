You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [0]
        
        c = [0]
        
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `m` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed, `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user for the final iteration, `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. The condition inside the if statement will be evaluated based on the last values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s`. If the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is true, 'YES' will be printed; otherwise, 'NO' will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, q, c, l_i, and r_i. It returns a result based on the queries defined within the test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
