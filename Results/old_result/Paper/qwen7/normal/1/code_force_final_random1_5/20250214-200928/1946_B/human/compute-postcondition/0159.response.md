State: **`sm` is -111, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than -1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `n`.
2. The loop condition is `range(n + 1)`, which means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n` inclusive.
3. For the loop to execute, `n + 1` must be a positive integer because the range function requires its argument to be a non-negative integer.
4. Therefore, `n` must be greater than -1 (i.e., `n >= 0`).

The initial state of `sm` (-111) does not affect the loop's execution condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are to set `i` to 0 (the starting value of the loop) and ensure that `n` is greater than -1.
