Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), this condition is preserved. The other information about `n` and `k` remains unchanged as they are not involved in this particular code snippet.
