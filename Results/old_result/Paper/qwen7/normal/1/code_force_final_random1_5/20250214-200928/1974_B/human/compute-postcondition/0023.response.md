Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `s`, `unique_chars` is a list containing unique characters from `s` with the character `char` inserted at index `i`, `j` is increased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code inserts the character `char` into the list `unique_chars` at the index specified by `i`. The values of `s`, `char`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is increased by 1 due to the code execution.
