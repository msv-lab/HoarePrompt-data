Output State: **`total` is 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `best` to be `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `best` is now specifically defined as `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `best` was previously greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
