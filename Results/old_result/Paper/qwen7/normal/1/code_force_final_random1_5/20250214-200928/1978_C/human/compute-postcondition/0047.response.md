Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, i is 0, k is 0, and the list l is reversed compared to its initial state.**

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` and adjust `k` until `i` reaches 0. After each iteration, the last element of the list `l` is moved to the front, effectively reversing the list. Once `i` reaches 0, the condition `if k == 0:` is met, causing the function to return the reversed list `l`.
