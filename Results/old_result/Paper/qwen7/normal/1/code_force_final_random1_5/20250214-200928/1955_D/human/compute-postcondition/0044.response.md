Postcondition: `i` is equal to `m`, `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` is increased by the number of times `a[m-1]` was found in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `curr` is less than `k`, the values of `i`, `cnt_b[a[m-1]]`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
