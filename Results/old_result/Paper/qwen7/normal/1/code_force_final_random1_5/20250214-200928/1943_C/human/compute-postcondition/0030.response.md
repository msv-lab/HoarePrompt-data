Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`, and the current value of `n` is -1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, or `n`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables retain their previous states.
