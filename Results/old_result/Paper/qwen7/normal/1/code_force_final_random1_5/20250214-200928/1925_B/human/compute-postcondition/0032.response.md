Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i`, depending on whether `x % i == 0` holds true. If the condition is met, `ans` is updated to `i`; otherwise, `ans` remains as the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.
