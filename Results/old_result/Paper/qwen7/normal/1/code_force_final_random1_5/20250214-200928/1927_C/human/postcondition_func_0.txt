The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads values for \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \). It then counts how many elements in \( a \) and \( b \) are within the range from 1 to \( k/2 \) (inclusive) and satisfy certain conditions. If both counts equal \( k/2 \), it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.
