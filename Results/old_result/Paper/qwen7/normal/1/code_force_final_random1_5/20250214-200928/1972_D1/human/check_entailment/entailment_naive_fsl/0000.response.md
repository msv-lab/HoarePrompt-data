Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided functions do not contain any implementation that addresses this specific logic.

The functions defined in the program are mostly utility functions for reading input, and none of them implement the core logic needed to solve the problem. For instance, `func_15` attempts to solve a different problem and does not handle the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Since the program does not contain any implementation that correctly calculates the number of valid pairs according to the given conditions, it is incorrect.
