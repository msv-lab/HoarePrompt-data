Output State: **`rest` is now equal to `rest - delta`, `pos` is unchanged, and `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

This means that the value of `rest` has been decreased by the value of `delta`, which is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The variable `pos` remains unchanged, and `delta` retains its original value.
