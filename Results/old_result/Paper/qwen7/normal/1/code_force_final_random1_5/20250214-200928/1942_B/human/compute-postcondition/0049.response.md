Output State: **`i` is -len(ar), `mex` is the minimum value of mex - ar[i] for all i in the range of len(ar), `res` is a list of length n where each element is mex - ar[i] for the corresponding index i, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `mex`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state. The number of iterations left is also updated to `int(input()) - 1`, but since the input is taken here, it is represented as `n` in the output state.
