Output State: **nx is a string, `i` is 0, `j` is n+1, and `n` is at least 4.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `j` will reach `n+1` because the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Once `j` exceeds `n`, the loop terminates. At this point, `i` will have been decremented to 0 since it starts at `n` and is not incremented; instead, the loop implicitly decreases `i` by 1 with each iteration due to the range starting from 1 up to `n`. Therefore, `i` becomes 0 after the loop has executed `n` times. The value of `nx` will be constructed based on the conditions within the loop, but since the loop has completed, `nx` will hold the final concatenated string resulting from the loop's logic.
