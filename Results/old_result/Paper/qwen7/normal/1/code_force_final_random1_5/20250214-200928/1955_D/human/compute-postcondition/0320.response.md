Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: According to the given information, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n - m - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 (since the loop will iterate from 0 to `n - m - 1`).

3. **Determine the State of `b_values`**: The loop iterates over `b_values`, which means `b_values` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables mentioned (`n`, `m`, `len(b)`, `cnt_b`, `a`, `k`, `curr`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They will be modified within the loop body according to the given conditions.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `b_values`.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `b_values` must contain at least one element

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `b_values` must contain at least one element**
