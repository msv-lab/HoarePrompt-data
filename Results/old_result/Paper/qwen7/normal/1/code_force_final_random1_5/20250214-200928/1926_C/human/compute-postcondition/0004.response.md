The loop condition is `num != 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must not be 0.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is equal to `num` modulo 10
- `num` is now equal to `int(num / 10)`

To ensure the loop executes again, `num` must not be 0. Since `num` is updated to `int(num / 10)` at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that `num` is still not 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` to ensure it is not 0.

State: **`a` is equal to `num` modulo 10, `num` must be greater than 0**
