#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3, u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and the input consists of n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree.

    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `u2vs` will represent an undirected graph where each edge between nodes `u` and `v` is bidirectional, and the lists within `u2vs` will contain all neighbors of each node in the order they were connected.

    #State: Output State: `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`.
    #
    #This final state indicates that the loop has iteratively traced back from the node `b` using the `previous` pointers until it reaches node 0, constructing the complete path. The loop terminates when `n == -1`, which signifies that no parent node can be found, meaning the path has been fully reconstructed.

        #State: Output State: `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), appending the tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops` in each iteration. Since `ci` is initially set to half the length of `path_ba`, rounded down, and given that `path_ba` has an odd length, `ci` will be an integer. After all iterations of the loop, `ops` will contain one tuple for each integer from `0` to `ci`, inclusive.

            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, `ops` is a list containing twelve tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4), (c1, 6), (c2, 6), (c1, 8), (c2, 8), (c1, 10), (c2, 10), (c1, 12), (c2, 12)), and `i` is 12.
        #
        #This output state is calculated based on the given loop, which iterates from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`. Given that the loop has been observed to run three times up to `i = 6`, it will continue to run until `i` reaches `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`. If `path_ba` has a length of `n`, then `c1` would be `n // 2 - 1`. The loop appends pairs of tuples to `ops` in each iteration, increasing the count of tuples by 2 each time, starting from `(c2, 1)` and `(c2, 2)`. Thus, after all iterations, `ops` will contain 12 such tuples, and `i` will be equal to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.
    #State: `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci` if `len(path_ba)` is odd. Otherwise, `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `ops` is a list containing twelve tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4), (c1, 6), (c2, 6), (c1, 8), (c2, 8), (c1, 10), (c2, 10), (c1, 12), (c2, 12))`, and `i` is 12.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: 12
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: - The printed output will be:

    #     c2 + 1 1
    #     c2 + 1 2
    #     c1 + 1 4

    #Output:
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input integer `n` and a list `u2vs` representing the edges of a tree. It constructs the tree structure, performs breadth-first search (BFS) twice, and based on the results, generates and prints a specific sequence of operations. Finally, it returns `None`.
