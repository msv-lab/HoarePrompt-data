Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `power` is 1 more than its previous value.**

Explanation: The variable `power` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was 1 more than its previous value (implying it was 1 initially), it is now 2. The condition that `n_cases` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the updated value of `power` is 1 more than its previous value.
