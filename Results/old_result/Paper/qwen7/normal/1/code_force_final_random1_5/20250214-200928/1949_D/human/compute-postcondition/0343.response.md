Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to `n + 1`.
   - `n` is at least 4.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop `for j in range(1, n + 1)` will execute as long as `1 <= j < n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be within this range initially.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is currently `n + 1`, it is not within the range `1 <= j < n + 1`.
   - To make the loop executable, `j` must be set to a value within the range `[1, n]`.

Given that `n` is at least 4, let's choose the smallest possible value for `j` which is 1. This ensures that the loop can start executing.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `nx` remains an empty string.
   - `i` is not involved in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - `j` should be set to 1.
   - `n` remains at least 4.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is n, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 4**
