Output State: `cons` is -2 or `n` - 2, whichever is smaller.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, after the third iteration of the loop, the value of `y` is -2, which means that `y` has been fully depleted before the loop could process all elements in `val`. Therefore, the loop will terminate early, and the final value of `cons` will be determined by the expression `min(n - 2, cons)`. Given that `cons` is already -2, the final value of `cons` remains -2, as -2 is smaller than any possible `n - 2` (since `n` is at most 10^4).
