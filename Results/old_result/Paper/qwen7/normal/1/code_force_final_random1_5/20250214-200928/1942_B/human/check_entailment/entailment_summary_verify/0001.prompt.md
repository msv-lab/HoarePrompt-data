You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes a new list `res` of length `n` where each element is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, with `mex` being the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`. Finally, it prints the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
Given:
- A permutation \( p \) of length \( n \).
- An array \( a \) of length \( n \) where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

We need to find a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the condition for \( a \).

### Given Program Analysis
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values of length \( n \).
   - `mex` is initialized to \( n \).

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates backward through the array \( a \).
   - For each index \( i \), it calculates \( res[i] = \texttt{mex} - a[i] \).
   - It then updates `mex` to be `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The result is printed as a space-separated string.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`:**
   - The logic to update `mex` is flawed. The program incorrectly updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` which does not align with the definition of MEX.
   - The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of \( p \), but the program is incorrectly updating `mex` based on the value of `ar[i]`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Permutation:**
   - The program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) by directly calculating `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, which is not a valid approach to solve the problem.
   - The MEX calculation and permutation construction need to be handled more carefully.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize the permutation \( p \) with values from 0 to \( n-1 \).
2. Calculate the MEX for each prefix of \( p \) and ensure it matches the corresponding value in \( a \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = list(range(n))
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in res[:i+1]:
                mex += 1
            assert ar[i] == mex - res[i], "Invalid permutation"
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating `mex` and constructing the permutation. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
