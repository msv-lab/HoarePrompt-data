Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `t1` is (a[0] + 1) % n and is not in set `st`, `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n and is in set `st`**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0, so now it is 1. The values of `i`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
