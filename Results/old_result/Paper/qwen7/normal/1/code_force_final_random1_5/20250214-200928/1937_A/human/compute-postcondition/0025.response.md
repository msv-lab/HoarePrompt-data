Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 1 more than its previous value; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The conditions for `n_cases` and the relationship between `i` and its previous value remain unchanged.
