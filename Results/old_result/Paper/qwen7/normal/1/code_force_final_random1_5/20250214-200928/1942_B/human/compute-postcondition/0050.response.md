Output State: **`i` is -len(ar), `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all i in the range of `len(ar)`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`, and `ar` is a list of integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `ar`. The values of `i`, `mex`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new list `ar` contains the integers inputted by the user.
