Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by 2, `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing `u` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decreases the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` was initially the first integer from the input decreased by 1, after executing the code, `u` becomes the first integer from the input decreased by 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
