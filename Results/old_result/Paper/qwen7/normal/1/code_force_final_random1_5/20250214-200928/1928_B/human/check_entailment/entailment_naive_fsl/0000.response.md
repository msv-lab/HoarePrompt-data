Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The functions defined (func_1 through func_9) do not perform the task described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires a function to process an array and determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. However, none of the functions provided are relevant to solving this problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
