### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - This step is correct and handles the input format as specified.

2. **Test Cases Loop**:
   - It iterates over each test case, correctly extracting `n` and `q` for each test case.
   - This step is also correct.

3. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The program constructs the prefix XOR array `pf` correctly, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This step is correct.

4. **Mapping Construction**:
   - It uses a dictionary `mp` to map each unique value in the prefix XOR array to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - This step is correct and ensures that we can quickly find the positions where a particular prefix XOR value occurs.

5. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` using the prefix XOR values and checks if this XOR value is zero.
     - If the XOR is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results.
     - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a valid split such that the XOR of the subarray equals the XOR of the prefix up to some index.
       - It uses binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the mapped lists.
         - This step is correct and ensures that the program can efficiently check for valid splits.
   - The logic for checking the valid split is correct. Specifically, it checks if there is a segment within the subarray that has the same XOR value as the prefix XOR up to some index.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program formats the output correctly, appending a newline after each test case's results.
   - This step is correct.

### Evaluation:
Based on the provided function summary and the detailed reasoning above, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program parses the input correctly, constructs the necessary data structures, and processes each query as specified.
