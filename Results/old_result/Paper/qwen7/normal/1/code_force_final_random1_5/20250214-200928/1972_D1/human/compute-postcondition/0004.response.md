Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by `range(func_10())`. This means the loop will iterate as many times as the return value of `func_10()`.

2. **Understand the function `func_10()`**: The problem states that `func_10()` returns a positive integer that is one less than its previous value. This implies that `func_10()` is decrementing a counter each time it is called.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `func_10()` returns a positive integer that is one less than its previous value.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `func_10()`, the only variable that needs adjustment is the return value of `func_10()`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` returned a positive integer that was one less than its previous value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer that is one less than its current value.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `t` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in controlling the loop.
- `func_10()` must return a positive integer that is one less than its previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `func_10()` will return a value that is one less than its previous value.

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `func_10()` returns a positive integer that is one less than its previous value**.
