Postcondition: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `power` is equal to `n`, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block. If the condition `power == n` is satisfied, then `power` equals `n` and the loop terminates, setting `i` to `n + 1`. If the condition is not satisfied, then `power` remains less than `n` and the loop continues, but the final state of `i` will still be `n + 1` once the loop ends.
