Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the range condition which involves `len(path_ba)` and `c1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`. This means `i` starts from `1` and increments by `2` until it reaches a value less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1.
   - `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal.
   - `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal.
   - `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0.
   - `ops` is a list containing four tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4))`.
   - `i` is 4.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently `4`, the next value of `i` would be `6` if the loop continues.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.

5. **Calculate the new conditions**:
   - `c2` is already defined as the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1.
   - To determine the new state, we need to check if `i + 2` (which is `6`) is still within the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - If `i + 2` is within the range, then `i` becomes `6`.
   - `d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `ops` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, `ops` is a list containing four tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4)), and `i` is 6**.
