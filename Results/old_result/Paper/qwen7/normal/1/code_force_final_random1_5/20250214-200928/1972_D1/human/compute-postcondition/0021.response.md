Functionality: **The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, adjusting the value of `k` by subtracting `(m - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`. After the loop, if `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.**
