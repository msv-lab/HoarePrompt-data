Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ntest` is an input integer.
   - `itest` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `a[len(a) - 1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`.
   - `a[0]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.
   - The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the last element and the first element of the list `a`.

Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers, the difference between the last element and the first element will be the range of the list.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the first and last elements of the list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`**
