Postcondition: `i` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value (1) and `ans`, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `x % i == 0`. The current value of `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `(x - n * i) % i` is equal to 0. If the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is true, `i` is further updated to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i`.
