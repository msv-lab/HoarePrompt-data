Output State: **`sm` is equal to `suf[n]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` over the input string split, `suf` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `suf`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`sm`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged, and `suf` is now an empty list.
