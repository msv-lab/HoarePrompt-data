Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(l, r)` from the `ops` list. Therefore, the relevant objects are `l`, `r`, and `ops`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `n`: This is an input integer.
   - `a`: This is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops`: These are the results of the function `func_2(a)`. The function `func_2` returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a range `(l, r)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `ops` list. Each element in `ops` is a tuple `(l, r)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on the `ops` list having at least one element, `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`.
   - For the first iteration of the loop, `l` and `r` will be the values from the first tuple in `ops`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`.
- `l` and `r` should be the values from the first tuple in `ops`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\), `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`, `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, and `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`**.
