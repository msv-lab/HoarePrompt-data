Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `i` is equal to `m`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with an integer factory function. This means that `d1` can hold key-value pairs where the values are integers by default. None of the existing variables (`m`, `j`, `i`, `n`, `l`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
