Output State: **`results` contains the value of `missing`, `freq` list contains the frequency count of each uppercase letter in the string `a`, `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each element in `freq`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `missing` to the list `results`. The values of `freq` and `missing` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `results` now includes the calculated value of `missing`.
