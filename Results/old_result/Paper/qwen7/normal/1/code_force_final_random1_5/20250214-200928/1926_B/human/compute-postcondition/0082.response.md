Functionality: **The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and an n x n grid of characters ('0' or '1'). It determines whether the grid contains a triangle or a square that includes all the '1's and prints 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' accordingly for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the type of shape found for each test case.**
