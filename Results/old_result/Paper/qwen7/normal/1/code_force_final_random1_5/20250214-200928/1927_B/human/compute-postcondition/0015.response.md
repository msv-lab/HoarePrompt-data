Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(int(input())):` statement. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is equal to `l`.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` and then accessing the corresponding index in the list `alp`.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i`, and `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is in the range of `int(input())`, the next value of `i` should still be within the valid range.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `array` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `rev_array` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

6. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - The only thing that changes is the value of `i`, which should be incremented by `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` and then accessing the corresponding index in the list `alp`, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
