Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` in the range function, but since it's just a placeholder, we focus on the variables that change within the loop body.

2. **Variables that Change in the Loop Body**:
   - `q`: Decreased by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `idx`: Increased by 4 at the end of each iteration.
   - `r`: Updated to `data[idx + 1]` at the end of each iteration.
   - `results`: Appended with 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `q` must be a positive integer (since it is decreased by 1 each iteration).
   - `idx` must be such that `idx + 4` is a valid index in `data`.
   - `r` must be a valid integer from `data[idx + 1]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is a positive integer decreased by 1.
- `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`.
- `idx` is increased by 4.
- `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`.
- `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.
- `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted.
- `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one.
- `r` is now an integer from `data[idx + 1]`.
- `results` is either appended with 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`.

For the next iteration:
- `q` must still be a positive integer.
- `idx` must be such that `idx + 4` is a valid index in `data`.
- `r` must be a valid integer from `data[idx + 1]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `q` should be `q - 1` (decreased by 1).
- `idx` should be `idx + 4`.
- `r` should be the next valid integer from `data[idx + 1]`.

Since `l` and other derived values (`x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) depend on `r` and `idx`, they will automatically update when `r` changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 4, `r` is the next integer from `data[idx + 1]`, `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, and `results` is either appended with 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`**.
