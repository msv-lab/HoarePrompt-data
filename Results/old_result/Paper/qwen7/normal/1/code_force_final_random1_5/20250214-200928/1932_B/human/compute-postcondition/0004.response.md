Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `year` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `year`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a` are preserved.
