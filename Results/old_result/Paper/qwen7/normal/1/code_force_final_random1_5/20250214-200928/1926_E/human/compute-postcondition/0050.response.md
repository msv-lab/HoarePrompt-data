Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [4], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 8, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `m` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The variable `m` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `m` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
