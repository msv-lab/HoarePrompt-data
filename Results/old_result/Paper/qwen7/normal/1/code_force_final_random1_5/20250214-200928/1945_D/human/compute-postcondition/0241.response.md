Output State: **`custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `custo` by `a_values[y]`. Given that `y` is `max_p - 2` and `a_values` is an empty list, the value of `a_values[y]` is undefined (since `y` is an index into an empty list), but `custo` is increased by whatever value `a_values[y]` evaluates to. The values of `y`, `a_values`, and `b_values` remain unchanged from their initial state.
