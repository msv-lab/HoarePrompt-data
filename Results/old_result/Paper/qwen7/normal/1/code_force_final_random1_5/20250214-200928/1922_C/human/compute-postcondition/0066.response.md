Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `m` must be greater than 0; `j` is equal to `m-1`; `x` and `y` are integers from the input for each iteration; if `y` is greater than `x` during any iteration, the difference `d1[y] - d1[x]` is printed; otherwise, the difference `d2[y] - d2[x]` is printed. The values of `m` and `j` do not change regardless of the conditions inside the loop.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be set to `m-1` (since `j` increments with each iteration of the loop from 0 to `m-1`). The values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the loop's iterations, but the loop itself does not modify the value of `m` or `j`. The output consists of the results of the if-else conditions executed for each input pair `(x, y)` during the loop's iterations.
