Output State: **All the variables remain unchanged except for `zero`, `one`, and `lst`. After all iterations of the loop, `zero` will be the total count of '0' in the string `s`, `one` will be the total count of '1' in the string `s`, and `lst` will contain all positions `i + 1` where both `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` are greater than or equal to 50.**

This means that after the loop completes, `zero` and `one` will reflect the total counts of '0' and '1' in the entire string `s`, respectively. The list `lst` will contain all positions (index + 1) where the percentage of '0's up to that index is at least 50% and the percentage of '1's from that index to the end of the string is also at least 50%. All other variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, `n`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`) will retain their values from the final iteration of the loop.
