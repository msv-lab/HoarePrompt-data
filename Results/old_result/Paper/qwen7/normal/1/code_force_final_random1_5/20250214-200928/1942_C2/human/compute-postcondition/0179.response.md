Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is 0, `y` is -2, `sx` is -1, `cons` is -2**.

Explanation: After the loop, the values of the variables are as follows:
- `i` is the last element of `val`, which is `1`.
- `x` remains greater than or equal to 3.
- `c` is `0` (since `i` is `1`).
- `y` is `-2`.
- `sx` is `-1`.
- `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, which is `3 + (-1) - 2 = 0`.
