Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the corners of the grid and does not account for all possible configurations that could prevent making all squares the same color. Specifically, the logic fails to handle cases where the grid has a checkerboard pattern or other non-uniform patterns that cannot be unified with the given operations.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to check if there exists any row or column that has alternating colors, as this would prevent unifying the entire grid into a single color. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if any row or column has alternating colors
        for i in range(n):
            if any(gr[i][j] != gr[i][j+1] for j in range(m-1)):
                print("NO")
                break
        else:
            for j in range(m):
                if any(gr[i][j] != gr[i+1][j] for i in range(n-1)):
                    print("NO")
                    break
            else:
                print("YES")
```

This corrected version checks every row and column for alternating colors and prints "NO" if such a configuration is found, ensuring that the grid can be unified into a single color if no such configuration exists.
