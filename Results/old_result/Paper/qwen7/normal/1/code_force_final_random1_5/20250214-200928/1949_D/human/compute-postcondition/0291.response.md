Output State: **`nx` is 'SF', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating the string `'F'` to its current value. Given that `nx` was either `'S'` or `'F'`, after the operation, `nx` becomes `'SF'`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
