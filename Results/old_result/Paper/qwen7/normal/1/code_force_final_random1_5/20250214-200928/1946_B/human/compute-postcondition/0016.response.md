Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is equal to `t`, `smin` is a list starting with 0.**

Explanation: The given code snippet initializes `smin` as a list containing a single element, which is 0. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `n`, `i`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
