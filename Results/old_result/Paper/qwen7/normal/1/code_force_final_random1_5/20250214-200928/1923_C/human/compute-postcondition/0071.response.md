Output State: **`x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` must contain the value 1, `i` is increased by 1, `p` contains the value `i + 1`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was previously increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
