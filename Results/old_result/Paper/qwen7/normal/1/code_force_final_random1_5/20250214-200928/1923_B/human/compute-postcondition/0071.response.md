Output State: **`distance` is increased by 1, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `rest` is `k`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` to the variable `delta`. Here, `rest` is equal to `k`, and `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`. The value of `distance` is increased by 1, which means `distance` is now one more than its previous value. The values of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` and `k` determine the exact value of `delta`, but without specific values for these, we express `delta` in terms of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
