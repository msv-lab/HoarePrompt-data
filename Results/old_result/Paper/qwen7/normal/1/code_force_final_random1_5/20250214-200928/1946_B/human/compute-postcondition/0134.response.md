Output State: **`suf` is updated such that `suf[k+2] = suf[k+1] + l[k+1]`.**

Explanation: The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends a new element to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is now `k+1`, the new element is `suf[k+1] + l[k+1]`. Therefore, `suf` is updated to include this new element at position `k+2`. The initial condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
