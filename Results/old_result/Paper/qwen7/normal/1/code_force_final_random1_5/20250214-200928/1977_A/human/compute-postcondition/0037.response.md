Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer from the first split.
   - `m` is an input integer from the second split.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range of `t`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs based on the value of `i`, and `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run `t` times.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - Therefore, we need to update the state of `i` to reflect this change.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `t` remains unchanged because the loop does not affect it.
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged because the loop does not affect them directly (assuming no operations inside the loop change their values).

Given the above analysis, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split**.
