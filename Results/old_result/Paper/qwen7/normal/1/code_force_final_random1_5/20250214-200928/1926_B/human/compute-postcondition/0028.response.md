Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or remains 1, `k` is a list containing the integers 1 and the count of '1' in each of the input strings `b` for each iteration of the loop, and `b` is the last input string from the user, and the final state of `k[0]` is either equal to `k[1]` or not equal to `k[1]`.
