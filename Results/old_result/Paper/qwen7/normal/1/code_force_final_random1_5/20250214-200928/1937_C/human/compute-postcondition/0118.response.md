Based on the initial state provided, we know that `n` must be greater than 1. However, the values of `k`, `best`, `i`, and any other variables used in the `print` statement are not explicitly defined. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output a string with placeholders for these undefined variables.

Output: **'? [k] [best] [k] [i]**' (where `[k]`, `[best]`, and `[i]` represent the values of the respective variables, and `?` is a placeholder that might have a specific meaning within the context of the program but is not provided here)
