### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_4**: This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` is odd or the maximum possible value is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - **func_1**: This function attempts to construct a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value.
   - **func_2 & func_3**: These functions swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5**: Prints the permutation if found.
   - **func_6**: Main function that orchestrates the process.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The Manhattan value is always even because each term \( |p_i - i| \) is either even or odd, and their sum must be even.
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) if `n` is odd, and \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) if `n` is even.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - **func_4**: Correctly checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - **func_1**: This function is overly complex and does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically:
     - The loop in `func_1` iterates from `n` down to 1 in steps of 2, which means it only considers even values of `i`. This is problematic because the Manhattan value depends on the absolute differences between `p_i` and `i`, and not just the parity of `i`.
     - The function `func_1` does not ensure that the permutation constructed satisfies the required Manhattan value. Instead, it relies on `func_2` and `func_3` to adjust the value, but these functions do not guarantee that the final permutation will have the exact required Manhattan value.
   - **func_2 & func_3**: These functions swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value, which is a good approach but might not cover all scenarios. However, the way `func_1` uses these functions is flawed.
   - **func_5 & func_6**: Correctly handle the output format.

5. **Testing Specific Cases:**
   - For small values of `n` and `k`, the function should produce correct results.
   - For larger values, the function should still work as long as the logic handles edge cases properly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, the function correctly returns "NO".
   - When `k` is even and within the possible range, the function should return a valid permutation.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that the implementation is not entirely correct. While the functions handle some aspects of the problem correctly, the main function `func_1` does not ensure that the constructed permutation will have the exact required Manhattan value. The use of `func_2` and `func_3` to adjust the value is insufficient and may not always produce the correct result.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the main function `func_1` does not ensure that the constructed permutation will have the exact required Manhattan value, leading to potential incorrect outputs.
