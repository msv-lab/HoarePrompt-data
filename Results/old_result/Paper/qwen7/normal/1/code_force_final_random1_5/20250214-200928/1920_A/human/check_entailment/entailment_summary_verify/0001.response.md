### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints. There are three types of constraints:
     - \( k \geq x \)
     - \( k \leq x \)
     - \( k \neq x \)

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`), but these functions are not used in the main logic for solving the problem.
   - The main function is `func_7`.

3. **Main Function Analysis (`func_7`)**:
   - It reads the number of constraints \( n \).
   - Initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0.
   - Iterates through each constraint:
     - For type 1 constraints (\( k \geq x \)), updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and \( x \).
     - For type 2 constraints (\( k \leq x \)), updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and \( x \).
     - For type 3 constraints (\( k \neq x \)), adds \( x \) to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts how many elements in `num` lie between `start` and `end`.
   - Adjusts the count if `start` exceeds `end` and returns the result.

4. **Function Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary provided for `func_7` accurately describes its behavior. It correctly identifies the valid range for \( k \) using `start` and `end`, and correctly excludes values from `num` that fall within this range.
   - The final check ensures that the count is adjusted if the valid range is empty.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the valid range for \( k \) using `start` and `end`.
   - It correctly excludes values from `num` that fall within this range.
   - The final check ensures that the count is adjusted if the valid range is empty.

Given the analysis and the function summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
