Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variable `i` is the loop control variable.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This means that the input to `int(input())` will be the value of `t`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute for each value of `i` generated by `range(t)`.
   - Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.
   - We do not need to adjust the state of `i` because it will be initialized to 0 and incremented within the loop.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute properly.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
