Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the query point `d` falls exactly between two known points `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. Specifically, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position `s` where `d` would fit in the sorted list `a`, but it does not correctly calculate the time for points that fall exactly between `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`. This can lead to incorrect results because the speed between these points is not accounted for properly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
10 1 1
10
10
5
```
The program should output `5` because the car travels at a constant speed of 1 unit per minute. However, the current implementation might output `4` or another incorrect value because it does not correctly interpolate the time for points between known speeds.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the interpolation between known speeds more accurately.
