Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    score = 0
    for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
        score += l[i]
    print(score)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final value of `score` will be the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, which is `len(l)//2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `score` will hold the sum of all elements in `l` that are at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), assuming `n` is large enough to allow at least `len(l)//2` iterations. If `n` is less than `len(l)//2`, the loop will terminate before completing all possible iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The value of `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, up to the 2*n-1th index if `n` is within the bounds of the list length. The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers entered by the user, and `n` must be a positive integer such that 2*n does not exceed the length of the list `l`. The variable `i` will be equal to 2*n after the loop finishes.

In simpler terms, `score` will be the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*n-2) of the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The `score` variable will be the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from index 0 and going up to but not including `2 * n`. The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers, and the variable `i` is set to `2 * n` after the loop finishes. The variable `n` remains as the input integer it was initialized with.

In simpler terms, the `score` will be the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*n-2) from the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
