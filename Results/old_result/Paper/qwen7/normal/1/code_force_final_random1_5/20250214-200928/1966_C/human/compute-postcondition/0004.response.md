Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is set to True.**

The code initializes the variable `dp` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `tc`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
