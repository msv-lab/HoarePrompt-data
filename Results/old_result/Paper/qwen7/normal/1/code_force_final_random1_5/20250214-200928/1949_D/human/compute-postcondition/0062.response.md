Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n` inclusive.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be in the range from 2 to `n` inclusive (since it starts from 1).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `j` will be `j + 1`, so if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is between 2 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0**
