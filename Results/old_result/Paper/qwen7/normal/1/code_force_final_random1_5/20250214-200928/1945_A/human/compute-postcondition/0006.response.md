Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is the first part of the split string, `c` is the third part of the split string, `s` is the next line in the input, `b` is updated to `b + c`.**

Explanation: The code `b += c` increments the value of `b` by the value of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `b` is now the original value of `b` plus `c`.
