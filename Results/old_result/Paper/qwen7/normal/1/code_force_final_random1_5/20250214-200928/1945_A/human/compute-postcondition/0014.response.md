Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. It calculates the sum of b and c for each test case and updates b accordingly. After processing all test cases, it prints the result based on the updated values of a and b, specifically the count of possible ways to arrange the people satisfying certain conditions, or an error message if the total number of people exceeds the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
