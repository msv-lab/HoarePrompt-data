Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `l` is 1
- `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`

To determine the value of `m`, we need to know the values of `b`, `bd`, `a`, `ql`, and `ad` at the index `s - 1`. Since these values are not explicitly given, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can describe it in terms of these variables.

Given this, the print statement will output the integer value of `m`.

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]))**
