Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state changes at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 0 or increased by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is decreased by 1 at least once.
   - `l` is 0 if `l <= r` is true, otherwise `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` becomes 0, then `r` remains 0, otherwise `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either 0 or increased by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` if it was not 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - `r` is decreased by 1 at least once, so at the start of the next iteration, `r` will be `r - 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` if it was not 0.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `r` will be `r - 1`.

Given the conditions, let's summarize the updated states:

- If `i` was 0, it will become 1.
- If `i` was not 0, it will increase by 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `r` decreases by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1**.

To provide a concrete example, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 2, `n` was 5, and `r` was 4, then at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be 3.
- `n` remains 5.
- `r` will be 3.

So, the final state would be:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is 3**.
