Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and adds `m` to it, storing the result in `mn`. The values of `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
