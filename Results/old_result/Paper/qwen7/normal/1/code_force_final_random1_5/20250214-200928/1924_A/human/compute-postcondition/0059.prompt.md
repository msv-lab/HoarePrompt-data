Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the original string `s`, `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97, and `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the original string `s`, `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97, and `tmp` is 'a' or 'b', and the current value of `cur` and 1 shifted left by `i` is 0, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the original string `s`, `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97, and `tmp` is 'c'. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the original string `s` (which is 0), `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character (which is an empty string), `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97 (which is an empty list), and `tmp` is 'a', and if `cur & 1 << i == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
