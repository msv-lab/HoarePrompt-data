Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes n, f, a, b (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9), and a list m containing n integers sorted in ascending order (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function performs operations based on these inputs and returns the results accordingly.**

Note: Since the specific operations to be performed are not detailed in the given information, the description focuses on the structure and inputs of the function.
