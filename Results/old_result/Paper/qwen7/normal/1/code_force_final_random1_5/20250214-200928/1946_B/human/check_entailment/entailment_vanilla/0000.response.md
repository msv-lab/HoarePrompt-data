### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key insight is that we can always insert the sum of the entire array multiple times to increase the sum.
   - After `k` operations, we can effectively add the sum of the entire array `k` times to the original array.

3. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `l`.
   - The code calculates the suffix sums (`suf`) and a minimum suffix sum array (`smin`).
   - The variable `sm` is calculated using these arrays but seems to be incorrectly used.
   - The final result is computed and printed.

4. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The calculation of `sm` is incorrect. The code uses `suf[i] - smin[i]`, which does not correctly represent the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` is not relevant to the problem.
   - The logic to handle negative results and take modulo is also incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum, we should simply add the sum of the entire array `k` times.
   - The sum of the array can be calculated as `sum(l)`.
   - The final result is `sum(l) * (2 ** k - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    for _ in range(t):
        b = input().split()
        n = int(b[0])
        k = int(b[1])
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        array_sum = sum(l)
        max_sum = (array_sum * (2 ** k - 1)) % MOD
        print(max_sum)
```

### Conclusion:
The given code is incorrect because it does not follow the correct approach to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
