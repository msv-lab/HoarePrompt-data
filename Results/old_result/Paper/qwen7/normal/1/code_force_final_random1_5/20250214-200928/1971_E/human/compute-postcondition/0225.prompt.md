You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers such that k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, and a_k = n. b is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1. d is a list of q integers where 0 ≤ d ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
        
        v = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
        
        for l in range(q):
            m = 0
            i = 1
            ql = int(input())
            s = bisect_left(a, ql)
            if a[s] == ql:
                print(b[s], end=' ')
                continue
            ql -= a[s - 1]
            m += b[s - 1]
            m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the following conditions will be true:
    #
    #- The variable `l` will be set to `q - 1`.
    #- The variable `i` will remain 1 throughout the loop.
    #- The variable `m` will contain the final cumulative sum after processing all inputs. This sum starts with `b[s - 1]` and adds the scaled values from `bd[s]` for each iteration, calculated as `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
    #- The list `v` will be a list of length `len(a)` where the first element is `0` and the rest are the results of dividing corresponding elements of `ad` by `bd`.
    #- The variable `t` will be unchanged, representing the number of test cases.
    #- The lists `a` and `b` will retain their original values after processing all queries.
    #- The variable `ad` and `bd` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, respectively, up to the last valid index.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `l` will be `q-1`, `i` will stay as 1, `m` will hold the final calculated value after processing all inputs, `v` will contain the ratios of differences, and `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` will keep their processed values but will not change further within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters t, n, k, q, a, b, and d. t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. n, k, and q are integers with k ≤ n, 1 ≤ k and q ≤ 10^5, and the sum of k and q do not exceed 10^5. a is a sorted list of k integers between 1 and n. b is a sorted list of k integers where each element is less than or equal to 10^9. d is a list of q integers between 0 and n. The function returns a value based on the given parameters.
