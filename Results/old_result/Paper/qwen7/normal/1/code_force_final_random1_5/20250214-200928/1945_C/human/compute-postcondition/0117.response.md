Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `zero_perc` is either 0, 100, or 50, `one` is 2, and `one_perc` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 1
- `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2

We calculate `zero_perc` for each possible value of `zero`:
- If `zero` is 0, `zero_perc` is `0 * 100 // 2` which is 0.
- If `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is `1 * 100 // 2` which is 50.
- If `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is `2 * 100 // 2` which is 100.

All other variables (`n`, `one`, and `one_perc`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
