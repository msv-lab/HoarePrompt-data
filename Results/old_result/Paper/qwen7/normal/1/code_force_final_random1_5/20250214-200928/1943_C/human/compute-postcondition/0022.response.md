Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0, `_` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node 0. The BFS function returns two values: `d`, which contains the shortest path distances from the starting node (node 0) to all other nodes in the graph, and `_` (which is typically used to store parent pointers for path reconstruction), which is not used in this context and is discarded. The structure of `u2vs` remains unchanged, and the values of `n`, `u`, and `v` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the BFS operation.
