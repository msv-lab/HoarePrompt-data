You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the final input string split on spaces and converted to integers, and the number of iterations left is `0`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`
     - `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`
   - If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Conditions Explanation:**
   - The first condition `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` checks if the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2.
   - The second condition `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2` checks if the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic in the program is based on the observation that if the first or last element is odd and cannot be reduced to zero through the given operations, then it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - However, this logic is incomplete and incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements without considering the entire array.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
- The program checks:
  - `b[0] = 1` (odd) and `b[1] = 3` (not equal to `1 + 2`), so it prints 'NO'.
- This is incorrect because the array can indeed be made zero with the given operations.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
- The program checks:
  - `b[0] = 2` (even) and `b[1] = 4` (equal to `2 + 2`), and
  - `b[-1] = 1` (odd) and `b[-2] = 5` (not equal to `1 + 2`), so it prints 'NO'.
- This is incorrect because the array can indeed be made zero with the given operations.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements without considering the entire array. The logic needs to be revised to check if the sum of the array is even and if all elements can be reduced to zero through the given operations.

### Correctness: **False**
