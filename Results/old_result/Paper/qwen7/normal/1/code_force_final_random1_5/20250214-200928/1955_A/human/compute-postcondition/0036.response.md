Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, with `i` being equal to the total number of iterations (which is the same as the number of test cases entered), `A`, `B`, and `C` being the last integers entered by the user for the final test case. The variable `X` is either the integer value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division if `A` was odd in any of the iterations, or it is the integer value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division for the last iteration if `A` was even.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases, and the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will be those provided for the last test case. Additionally, `X` will hold the result of `A // 2` from the last iteration where `A` was odd, or it will be undefined if `A` was always even throughout the iterations.
