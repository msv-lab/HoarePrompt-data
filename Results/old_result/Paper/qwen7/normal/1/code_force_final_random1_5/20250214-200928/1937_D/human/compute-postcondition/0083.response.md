Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '>', and `l` is less than `r`; `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `i` remains 0, `n` must still be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is still '>', `l` is still less than `r`, and `x` is still greater than or equal to 0.
