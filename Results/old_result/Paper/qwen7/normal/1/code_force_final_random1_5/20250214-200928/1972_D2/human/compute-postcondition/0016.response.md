Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` (integer division) and `m // ((x + y) * y)` (floor division), `n` must be large enough to satisfy \((x + y + 1) * x \leq n\), `m` must be large enough to satisfy \((x + y + 1) * (y + 1) \leq m\)**.

This means that `cnt` has been updated by adding the smaller value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. The conditions on `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
