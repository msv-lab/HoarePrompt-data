Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, the problem requires maximizing the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). Sorting the array and finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not necessarily maximize this specific sum.

To correctly solve the problem, we should consider the following approach:
1. Sort the array.
2. Pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are maximized.

Here's how the correct solution should work:
- Sort the array.
- Pair the first element with the last, the second with the second last, and so on.
- Calculate the sum of these differences.

Let's analyze the given program:
- It sorts the array.
- It calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the correct approach for the required sum of differences.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
