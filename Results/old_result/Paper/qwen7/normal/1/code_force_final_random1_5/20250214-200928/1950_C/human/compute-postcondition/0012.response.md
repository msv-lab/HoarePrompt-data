Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440.
- `s` is the input string.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
- `h` is not equal to '00'.
- `int(h)` is greater than 12.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `h` is the first two characters of `s` and it is not '00'. This means `h` could be any two-digit number from '01' to '99' except '00'.
2. Since `int(h)` is greater than 12, `h` must be one of the following: '13', '14', '15', ..., '99'.
3. The expression `int(h) - 12` will then yield a number from 1 to 87.
4. The `format` method will convert this integer into a string and prepend it with '0', resulting in a string from '01' to '87'.

Therefore, the output will be a string consisting of '0' followed by the result of `int(h) - 12`.

Output: **'0' followed by the result of int(h) - 12 (where h is the first two characters of s and int(h) > 12)**
