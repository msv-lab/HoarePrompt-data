Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the value of `winner`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration through the loop. The `results` list will contain `t` (which is now 0) elements, but since `t` is 0, the list will be empty. However, each element in the `results` list is the value of `winner`, which is determined by the function `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of inputs `a` and `b`. Since the loop runs `t` times, there will be `t` such `winner` values stored in the `results` list. Given that `t` ends up being 0, the `results` list will be empty, but the description follows the pattern established by the previous states.
