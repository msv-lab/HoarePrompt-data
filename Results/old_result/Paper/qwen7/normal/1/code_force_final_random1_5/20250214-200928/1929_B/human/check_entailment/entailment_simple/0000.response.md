Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `k`.
3. The logic checks if `4 * n - 2` is equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`, which is the correct formula for the minimum number of cells to color when `k` equals the total number of diagonals.
4. If `4 * n - 2` is not equal to `k`, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`, which is the correct approach for other values of `k`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the solution appears to be correct. The program handles all edge cases and computes the minimum number of cells to color accurately based on the provided conditions.

Correctness: **True**
