Output State: All nodes in the tree have been visited, `current` is the `target` node, and `dist` represents the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `visited` set contains every node in the tree, and the `queue` is empty since all nodes have been processed.

This means that the loop has successfully traversed the entire tree, finding the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `visited` set ensures no node is processed more than once, and the `queue` is used to keep track of nodes to be processed, ensuring a breadth-first search approach. Once all nodes are visited and the `current` node becomes the `target`, the distance `dist` holds the shortest path length.
