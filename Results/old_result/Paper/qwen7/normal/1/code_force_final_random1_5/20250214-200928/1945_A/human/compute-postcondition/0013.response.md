Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, if the total number of people (a + b + c) is within the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the function returns the count of possible ways to arrange these people such that the seating arrangement satisfies certain conditions (not specified here). If the total number of people exceeds the constraint, the function returns an error message indicating that the total number of people exceeds the allowed limit.**
