Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, the length of list `l` is at least `n-1`, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` using the formula `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is `n-4`, so `d2[n-4]` is set to `l[n-4] - l[n-5] + d2[n-3]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
