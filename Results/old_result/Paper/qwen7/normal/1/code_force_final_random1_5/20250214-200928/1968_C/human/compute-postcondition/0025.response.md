Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `(1000 + x[0]) + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

In this final output state, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` after all iterations of the loop have completed. The list `a` will have been updated such that each element from the second to the last (`a[1]` to `a[n-1]`) is the cumulative sum of the initial value (1000) and the corresponding elements from the list `x` up to that point. The length of the list `a` remains `n`, and the first element of `a` stays as 1000.
