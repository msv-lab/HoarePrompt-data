Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `r` is now an integer from `data[idx + 1]`, results is 'NO' unless the conditions are met (it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l)**

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increases the value of `idx` by 2. Since `idx` was previously increased by 2, the new value of `idx` is increased by 4 in total. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
