Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is either B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r or B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r), `b` is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 if it was not 0, and `r` is decreased by 1. The expressions for `a` and `b` are preserved as they were before the code execution, with `b` updated according to the new value of `i`.
