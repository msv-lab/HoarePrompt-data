Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is at least 9.
   - `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `x` is 2.
   - `cnt` is calculated as `min(9 / ((2 + 2) * 2), 12 // ((2 + 2) * 2))` since `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is true.

3. **Calculate the Current Values**:
   - `x + y = 2 + 3 = 5`.
   - `(x + y) * x = 5 * 2 = 10`.
   - `(x + y) * y = 5 * 3 = 15`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - The condition `(x + y) * x <= n` becomes `10 <= n`.
   - The condition `(x + y) * y <= m` becomes `15 <= m`.

5. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied.
   - Since `n` is at least 9 and `m` is at least 12, and given that `10 <= n` and `15 <= m` are already true based on the current values, no adjustments are necessary for these variables.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are fixed and cannot be changed directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are none of the loop head variables since they are already in a state that satisfies the loop condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is at least 9, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12, `y` is 3, `x` is 2**
