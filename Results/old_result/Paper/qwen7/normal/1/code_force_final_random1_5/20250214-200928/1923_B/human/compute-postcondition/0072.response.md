Output State: **`rest` is `rest - delta`, `distance` is increased by 1, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The variable `rest` is decreased by the value of `delta`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `distance` is increased by 1, `pos` is still less than the length of `sorted_indices`, and `delta` is still defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.
