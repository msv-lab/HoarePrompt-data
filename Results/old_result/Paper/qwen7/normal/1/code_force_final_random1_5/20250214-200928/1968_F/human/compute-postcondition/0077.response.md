Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 4; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` contains 'YES' appended to it; otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect.bisect_left).
