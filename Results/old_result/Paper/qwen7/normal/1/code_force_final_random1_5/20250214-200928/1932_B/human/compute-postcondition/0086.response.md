Output State: **`results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases` after processing all elements in `a`. `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). `n` is the last element of `test_cases`; `a` is the last test case in `test_cases`; `ai` is undefined. `current_year` is the smallest multiple of the last test case's `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value plus all increments made during the loop's iterations.**

This means that after the loop has executed for all test cases, the `results` list will contain the final computed `current_year` for each test case, reflecting the maximum possible value of `current_year` for each set of inputs processed. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ai`, and `current_year`) will reflect the state of the last test case processed.
