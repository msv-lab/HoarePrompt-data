Output State: **`nx` is the original value of either 'FF', 'SF', 'FS', or 'SS' plus the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`, and `j` is in the range from `2` to `n/4`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `nx` was originally either 'FF', 'SF', 'FS', or 'SS', and `j` is in the specified range, the updated value of `nx` will be the original value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
