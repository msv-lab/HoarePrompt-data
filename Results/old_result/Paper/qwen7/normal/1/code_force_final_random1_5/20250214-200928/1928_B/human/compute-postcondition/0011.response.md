Output State: `i` is `-1`; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `tem` from each iteration of the loop in reverse order.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` now being `-1` (one index past the last valid index of `arr`). The variable `tem` holds the product of all elements in `arr`. The list `ans` contains all the intermediate values of `tem` calculated during each iteration, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards.
