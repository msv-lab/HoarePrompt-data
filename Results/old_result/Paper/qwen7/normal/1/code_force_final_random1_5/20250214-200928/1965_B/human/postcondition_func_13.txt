The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on values obtained from `func_7()`. It returns either the string '1\n2' or a string containing space-separated integers. If `k` is 1, it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing all powers of 2 from \(2^{l-2}\) to \(2^l\), along with additional elements based on `k` and the sum of `ans`. Finally, it returns a string of these integers separated by spaces.
