Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, n and q are not yet defined as integers, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, and each query consists of l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

The variable `idx` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
