Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 3 * opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` subtracts `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`. Given that `opNum` is `a[i]`, the updated value of `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 3 * opNum - 2 * opNum` (from the initial state) minus an additional `opNum`, resulting in `a[i + 2] - 3 * opNum`. All other variables remain unchanged.
