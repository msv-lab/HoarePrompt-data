Output State: `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is now the last element of the list obtained by repeatedly popping the last element from `lst[z]` until the list is empty, `x` is 0, and `one` is False.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `tmp` will be set to the final value obtained by successively popping the last element from the nested lists starting from `lst[z]` until the innermost list is empty. The variable `x` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop, and `one` becomes False after the last iteration of the loop.
