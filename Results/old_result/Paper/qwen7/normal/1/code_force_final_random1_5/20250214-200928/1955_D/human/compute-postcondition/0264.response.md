Postcondition: **`i` is `n - m + len(b) + m`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for each `i` from `n - m + len(b)` to `n - m + len(b) + m - 1`, and `curr` is increased by 1 for each valid `a[i]` (where `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative). Additionally, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
