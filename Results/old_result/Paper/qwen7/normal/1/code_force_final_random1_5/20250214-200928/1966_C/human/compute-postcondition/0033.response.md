Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `tc > 0`.
2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `tc` is equal to `tc` - 1.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 1.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `tc`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - From the current state, `tc` is equal to `tc` - 1, meaning `tc` has been decremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Therefore, for `tc` to be greater than 0 in the next iteration, `tc` must be at least 1 (i.e., `tc` must be greater than or equal to 1).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `tc`, which must be greater than or equal to 1.

Thus, the modified state for the next iteration is:

**State: `tc` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 1.**
