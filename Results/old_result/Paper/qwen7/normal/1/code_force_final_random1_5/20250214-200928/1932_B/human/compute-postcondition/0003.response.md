Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each of these strings to integers, and stores them in the list `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
