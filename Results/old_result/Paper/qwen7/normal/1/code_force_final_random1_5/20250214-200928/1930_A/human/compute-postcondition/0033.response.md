Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `score` is 0 + the value of `l[i]`.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`.
   - This means `i` starts from 0 and increments by 2 each time until it reaches `2 * n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` must be less than `2 * n`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was an even number (e.g., 0, 2, 4, etc.) and was less than `2 * n`.
   - `score` is updated by adding the value of `l[i]` to the current `score`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 2.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `k` (an even number) before, it will become `k + 2` in the next iteration.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `i + 2` must still be less than `2 * n`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `score` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `score` remains the same.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented by 2.
   - `i` must still be less than `2 * n`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- `score` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 2.
- `i` must still be less than `2 * n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`score` is 0 + the value of `l[i]`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 2` and must be less than `2 * n`, `n` is an input integer**
