Output State: **`ind` is equal to the length of line minus one, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, `allPlayers` is populated with keys for any player identifiers found in `line` set to `False`, `goal` contains tuples for any goal identifiers found in `line`, `line` is updated to a list of stripped and split strings from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `grid` now includes the updated `line`.**

Explanation: The code `grid.append(line)` appends the current `line` (which is already updated to a list of stripped and split strings) to the `grid` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
