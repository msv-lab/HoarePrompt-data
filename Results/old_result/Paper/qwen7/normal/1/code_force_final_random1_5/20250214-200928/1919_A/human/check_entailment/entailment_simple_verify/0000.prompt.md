You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

    Bob

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'

        return 'Alice'

    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
        #The program returns 'Bob'
    else :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))

        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the value of `winner`, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The `results` list will contain `t` (which is now 0) elements, but since `t` is 0, the list will be empty. However, each element in the `results` list is the `winner` from the last iteration of the loop, as the `results` list is updated with the `winner` in each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. According to the problem description, the game involves taking turns and removing one coin from the current wallet until a player cannot make a valid move. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not simulate these turns or the removal of coins. Instead, they simply determine the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. This approach does not account for the actual gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to swap wallets and the requirement to remove a coin from the current wallet. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for the given problem description.
