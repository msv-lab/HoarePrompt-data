Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `3`.

5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration of `dp`**:
   - The expression for `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
   - For `i = 3`, the expression becomes `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1 or not dp`.

6. **Formulate the new state**: We need to update the state with the new value of `i` and the updated condition for `dp`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `dp` is `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1 or not dp`**.
