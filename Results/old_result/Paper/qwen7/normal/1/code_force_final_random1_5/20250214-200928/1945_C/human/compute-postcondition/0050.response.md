Output State: **i is equal to n-2, n is an input integer greater than 4, zero is either 1, 2, or 3, one is either 2, 3, or 4, zero_perc is 100, one_perc is -100, and lst is [3, 4, ..., n-1].**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-2`. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-2`. Since the conditions for appending to `lst` (`zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`) were met in the last iteration (when `i` was 3), `lst` will contain every index from 3 to `n-1`. Given that `i` goes up to `n-2`, the loop would have checked up to the second-to-last character, meaning `lst` will include all indices starting from 3 up to `n-1`. The counts of '0' and '1' in `sl` will depend on the input string `s`, but the percentages will always be 100 for `zero_perc` and -100 for `one_perc` due to the way the percentages are calculated.
