Output State: **`n` must be less than 15, `m` must be less than 10, `cnt` is increased by the minimum value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, and `y` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the value of `cnt` is determined by the original formula involving `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y`.
