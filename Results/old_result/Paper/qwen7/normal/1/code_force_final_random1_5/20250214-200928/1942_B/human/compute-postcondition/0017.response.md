Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `i` starts from `len(ar) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `0`.
   - `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was `i - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will now be `i - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be greater than or equal to `0`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `i - 2` (since it was `i - 1` before and now it decreases by 1).
   - `mex` will be updated to `mex - ar[i]` where `i` is now `i - 2`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i - 2]` and `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`**.
