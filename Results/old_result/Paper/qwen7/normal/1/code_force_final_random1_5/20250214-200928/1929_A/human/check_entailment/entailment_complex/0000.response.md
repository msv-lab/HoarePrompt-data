Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`). 
3. **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
4. **Beauty Calculation**: The maximum beauty of the array is calculated as the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array.
5. **Output**: The result is printed for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the example provided, the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and finding the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. This approach ensures that the difference is maximized because the sorted array allows us to use the smallest and largest values directly.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
