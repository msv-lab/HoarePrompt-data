Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is initialized. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is further decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, no change is made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`.
