Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to its original value, but its exact value is not specified.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' (or 1 if `res` was never '<'). Since no specific value for `res` is given, we assume `k` is 1.
- `res` is the final input string received, but its exact content is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Given the values:
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

The output will be:
Output: **'? 1 0 1 1'**
