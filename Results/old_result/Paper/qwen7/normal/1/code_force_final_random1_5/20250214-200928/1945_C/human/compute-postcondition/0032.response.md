Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`, `one` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `one` is incremented by 1, so `one` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. The condition `i < n - 1` is still valid since `i` is 2 and `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
