### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. This process is repeated `n` times until all integers are used.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices (i.e., `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ...).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest available numbers to maximize the score.
   - Summing the elements at even indices effectively pairs the smallest numbers together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is maximized.
   - This approach guarantees that the score is maximized because the smallest numbers are paired together, which is optimal for this problem.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the general case correctly.
   - It works for any valid input within the constraints provided (e.g., `1 <= t <= 5000`, `1 <= n <= 50`, `1 <= a_i <= 10^7`).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always pairing the smallest available numbers.

### Correctness:
**True**
