Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is `tc`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `array2` contains elements based on the specified conditions, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`**.

The code assigns the last element of the `feat` list to the variable `b`. Since `feat` is a list, `feat[-1]` refers to the last element of the list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
