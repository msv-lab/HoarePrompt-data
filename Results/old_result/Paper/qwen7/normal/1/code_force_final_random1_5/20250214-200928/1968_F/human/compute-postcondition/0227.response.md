Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and its current value is 0, and the list `results` has appended 'YES', and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement, the values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, `x`, and the list `results` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
