Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `B` is a list containing 0 if `idx_B` was empty, otherwise `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Since `i` was previously `n - 3`, `idx_B` now contains `[i]` which is `[n - 3]`. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `i` also remains unchanged at `n - 3`. The value of `B` depends on whether `idx_B` was empty before appending `i`. If `idx_B` was empty, `B` remains a list containing 0. If `idx_B` was not empty, `B` is updated to `[x]` where `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Since `idx_B` now has one element, `len(idx_B)` is 1, and `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` is `i`, so the calculation simplifies to `0 + (i - i) * 1 = 0`. Therefore, `B` remains a list containing 0.
