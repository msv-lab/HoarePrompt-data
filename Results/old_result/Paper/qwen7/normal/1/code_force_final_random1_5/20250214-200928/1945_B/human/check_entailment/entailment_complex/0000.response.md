Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.
2. The given solution attempts to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` plus `m` to determine the time interval when both installations launch fireworks within the visibility period of `m` minutes.
3. The logic in the code is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that the LCM of `a` and `b` plus `m` gives the correct answer without considering the actual intervals at which fireworks are launched.
4. The correct approach should involve finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` to determine how often both installations launch fireworks at the same time, and then using this to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
5. The current implementation does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when `a` and `b` have a GCD greater than 1.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
