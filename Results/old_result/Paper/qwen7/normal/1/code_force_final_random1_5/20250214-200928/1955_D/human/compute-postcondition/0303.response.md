Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` in the range `range(n - m)`. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n - m`. Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1. We need to check if `1 < n - m` to determine if the loop can continue.

4. **Adjust the Other States**: The other states (`n`, `m`, `len(b)`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `a[i + m]` being in `b_values`, `curr`, and `ans`) will remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified within the loop body. However, since the problem specifies that these states are not modified outside the if-else block, they will remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
- The condition for the next iteration is `1 < n - m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr - 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
