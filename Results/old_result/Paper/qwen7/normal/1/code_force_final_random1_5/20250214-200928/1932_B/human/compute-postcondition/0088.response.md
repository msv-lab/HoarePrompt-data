Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function processes the list of integers and returns a list of the final values of `current_year` for each test case.**
