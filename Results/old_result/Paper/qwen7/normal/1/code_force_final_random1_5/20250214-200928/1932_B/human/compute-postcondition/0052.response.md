Postcondition: `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is calculated based on `ai_next`, `ai` is `ai_next`, and `test_cases` remains unchanged. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai` and `ai` is `ai_next`. Otherwise, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
