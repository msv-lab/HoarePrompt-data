The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `suf` has an updated element at index `i` which is equal to `suf[1] + l[1]`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2 (assuming `n` is at least 2). Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `suf` has an updated element at index `i` which is equal to `suf[1] + l[1]`**
