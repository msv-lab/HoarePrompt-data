Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a1` is an integer from the input, `a2` is an integer from the input, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`**.

Explanation: The code divides `b` by 2 to assign the value to both `b1` and `b2`. Since `b` is divided by 2, both `b1` and `b2` will have the same value, which is `b // 2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
