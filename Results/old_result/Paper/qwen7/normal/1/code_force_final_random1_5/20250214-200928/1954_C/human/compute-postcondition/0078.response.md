Output State: **`i` is `len(a)` + 1, `new[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, `new2[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(a) + 1`. The values of `new` and `new2` at index `i-1` (which was `i` before the increment) remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
