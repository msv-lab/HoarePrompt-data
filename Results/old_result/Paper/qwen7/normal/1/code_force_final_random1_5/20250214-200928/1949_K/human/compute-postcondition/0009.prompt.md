Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`, and `numbers` is sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists; `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are both 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers:
    distribute_number(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is removed from the `numbers` list and added to one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`), `numbers` is now a list of `n-1` positive integers sorted in descending order, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n-1`, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are updated with one additional element, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated by adding `num` to the respective group's sum.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `numbers` is a list of `n-2` positive integers sorted in descending order, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that \(1 \leq na, nb, nc \leq n-3\) and \(na + nb + nc = n-2\), `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are updated with one fewer element each, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated by removing the previously added `num` from the respective group's sum.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `numbers` is a list of `n-3` positive integers sorted in descending order, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that \(1 \leq na, nb, nc \leq n-3\) and \(na + nb + nc = n-3\), `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are updated with one fewer element each, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated by removing the previously added `num` from the respective group's sum, `distribute_number(num)` has been called.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
