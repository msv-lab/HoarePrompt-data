Output State: **`total` is either 0 + `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or 0 + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` depending on whether `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -3, and `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` since `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `v` is -3.
- The condition `v <= pos_final` is checked, and since `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1 (let's denote the input integer as `input_int`), `pos_final` could be any integer less than `input_int`. Given that `v` is -3, `v` will always be less than or equal to `pos_final` regardless of the value of `pos_final`.
- Therefore, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, which is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.
