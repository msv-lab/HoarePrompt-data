Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are 0 and the third element is `a[3] - a[2]`, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `i` is 3, `len(a)` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 3, the value appended is `a[3] - a[2]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
