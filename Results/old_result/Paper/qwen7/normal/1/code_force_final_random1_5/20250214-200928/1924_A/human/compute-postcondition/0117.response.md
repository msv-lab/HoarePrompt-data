Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is 'a' + `i` - `i_prev` - 1, and `k` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns to `tmp` the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as `i_prev + 1`, the character `tmp` will be `'a' + (i_prev + 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `'a' + i_prev`. However, since `i_prev + 1` is used directly, `tmp` is specifically `'a' + `i` - `i_prev` - 1`. The value of `cur` and `k` remain unchanged.
