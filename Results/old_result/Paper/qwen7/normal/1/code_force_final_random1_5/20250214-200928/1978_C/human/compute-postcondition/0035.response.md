Output State: `c` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 2 * (number_of_iterations - 1)`, `k` is reduced by the sum of all `i` values minus the number of iterations plus 1, and `l` is the result of repeatedly applying `func_3(c, l)` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `c` will be the total number of times the loop ran, which is equal to the number of even numbers less than or equal to `n`. The variable `i` will be `n` minus twice the number of iterations minus 2. The variable `k` will be reduced by the sum of all `i` values minus the number of iterations plus 1. Finally, `l` will be the result of repeatedly applying `func_3(c, l)` for each iteration.
