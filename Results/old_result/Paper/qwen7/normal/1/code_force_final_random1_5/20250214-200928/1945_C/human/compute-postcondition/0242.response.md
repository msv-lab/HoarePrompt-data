Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is an empty list and sorted, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50; `final` now contains the value `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `n`, `final` now contains the value `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
