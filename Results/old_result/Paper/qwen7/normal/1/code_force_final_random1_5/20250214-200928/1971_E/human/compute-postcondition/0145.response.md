To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `l` is within the range `[1, a[s - 1] - 1)`.
   - `m` is initially undefined but will be updated based on the formula `m + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `ql` is being updated as `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.
   - If `a[s] == ql`, then `m` remains `m + b[s - 1]`, `i` remains 1, and `ql` is set to `a[s]`.
   - If `a[s] != ql`, the conditions remain as initially described.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The value of `m` depends on the value of `bd[s]`, `ad[s]`, and `ql`.
   - The value of `ql` is being reduced by `a[s - 1]`.
   - The value of `s` determines the position where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`.

Given these points, let's analyze the print statement:

- The print statement is `print(int(m), end=' ')`.
- This means we need to determine the integer value of `m`.

Since the exact values of `bd[s]`, `ad[s]`, and `ql` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact value of `m`. However, we know that `m` is updated based on the formula `m + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of `m` after it has been updated according to the given formula.

Output: **int(m)**
