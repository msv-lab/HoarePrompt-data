Output State: **`m` must be at least 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]` updates the value of `i` to be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
