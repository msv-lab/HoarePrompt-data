Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is also unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `i` is still 0. The values of `a` and `b` are the integers input by the user.
