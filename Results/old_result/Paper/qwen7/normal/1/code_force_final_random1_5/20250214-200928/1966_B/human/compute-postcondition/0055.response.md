Postcondition: `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`.
