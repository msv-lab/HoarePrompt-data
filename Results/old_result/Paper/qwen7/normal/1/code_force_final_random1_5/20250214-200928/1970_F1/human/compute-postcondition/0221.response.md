Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `comand` is equal to the list of strings read from standard input and stripped.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `command`. The original values of `t` and `time` remain unchanged.
