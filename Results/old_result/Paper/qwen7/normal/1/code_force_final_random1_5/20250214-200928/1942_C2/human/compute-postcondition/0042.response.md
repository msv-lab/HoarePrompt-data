Output State: **`ans` is equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers where the sum of the first element (`a[0]`) and `n` minus the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) equals 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value which was 0 (since no specific initial value for `ans` was given, it is assumed to be 0). The condition about the list `a` remains unchanged.
