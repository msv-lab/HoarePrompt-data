Output State: **`i` is 2; `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`**

Explanation: The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 2. The variable `dp` is updated to the value of `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is 2, this translates to `dp` being `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`. This is the new value of `dp` after executing the code.
