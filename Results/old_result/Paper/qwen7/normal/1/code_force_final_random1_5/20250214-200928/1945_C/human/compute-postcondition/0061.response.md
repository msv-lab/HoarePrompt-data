Output State: **`pk` is an integer, `elem` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, and `final` is a list containing one element which is `elem`.**

Explanation: The line `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` was not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be an empty list. After appending `elem`, `final` contains `[elem]`. The values of `pk`, `elem`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
