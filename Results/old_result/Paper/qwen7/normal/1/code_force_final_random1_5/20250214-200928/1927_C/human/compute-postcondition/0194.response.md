Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then either `aOnes` is set to 1 or `bOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then either `aOnes` is incremented by 1 or the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If neither of these conditions is met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
