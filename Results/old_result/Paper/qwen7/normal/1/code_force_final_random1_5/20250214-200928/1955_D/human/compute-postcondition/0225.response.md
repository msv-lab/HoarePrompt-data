Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n - m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, and `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each integer to an element in the list `b`. The initial values of `a`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged except that `b` is updated to this new list of integers.
