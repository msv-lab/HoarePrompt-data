Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])**.

This means that the variable `nxt` is now a tuple representing the new position calculated by adding the movement vector `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
