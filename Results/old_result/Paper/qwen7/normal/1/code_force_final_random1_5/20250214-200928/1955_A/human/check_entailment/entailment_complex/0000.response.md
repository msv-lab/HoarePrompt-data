Reasoning:

1. The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts considering both the regular price (`a`) and the promotional price (`b`).
2. The given code iterates over `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` which represent `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.
3. The code checks different conditions to determine the minimum cost:
   - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying them individually at the regular price. In this case, it calculates the cost as `A * B`.
   - If `A` is even, it calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the cost of buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price.
   - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost as `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2` (integer division), representing the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

Given these conditions, the logic in the code correctly handles the different scenarios to find the minimum cost for each test case. The code also properly processes all test cases without any logical errors.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
