Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `suf` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suf[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of the list `l`, `smin` is updated such that its first element is now `suf[i + 1]`, `sm` remains as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, and `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n` retain their values from the initial state or after the first 3 iterations, and `smin` has an additional element which is `suf[i + 1]`.**

This means that the list `smin` has been extended by appending `suf[i + 1]` as its new first element, while all other variables and the list `suf` remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
