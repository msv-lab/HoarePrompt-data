Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, `b` is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
