Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input, within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. All other variables retain their initial conditions.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input for the number of test cases, which is stored in the variable `test_cases`. The initial conditions for `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m` remain unchanged as they have not been assigned any values yet. Therefore, only `test_cases` is updated with the input value, and the other variables still follow their initial conditions.
