You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers representing Cowdeforce ratings and an integer `k`. It searches for the first two elements in `a` that are greater than the `k`-th element. If found, it returns a specific value based on the positions of these elements relative to `k`. If no such elements are found, it returns -1. The function can return one of the following values:
1. -1 if no conditions are met.
2. `k - 1` if `k` is not 14 and the list `ind` contains exactly one element, which is 0.
3. `ind[0] - 1` if `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements greater than `x` and `ind[0]` is greater than `k`.
4. The maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` if `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`.
5. The minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `13` if `ind[0]` is 0.
6. The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` if `ind[0]` is not 0.
7. The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of matches the cow at position `k` can win. We can swap the cow at position `k` with another cow to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of cows `n` and the cow's index `k`, then converts `k` to a zero-based index.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - It retrieves the rating of the cow at position `k`.
   - It initializes a list `ind` to store indices of cows with ratings greater than the cow at `k` and a counter `c` to count such indices.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to find up to two cows with ratings greater than the cow at `k`. This logic seems flawed because it should consider all cows with higher ratings.
   - If `k` is 14, it prints the indices found, which is unnecessary for solving the problem but indicates a potential debugging print statement.
   - It handles different scenarios based on the indices found:
     - If no cows have a higher rating, the cow can potentially win all remaining matches (`n - 1`).
     - If only one cow has a higher rating, it calculates the number of wins based on the position of this cow relative to `k`.
     - If two cows have higher ratings, it calculates the number of wins based on the positions of these two cows relative to `k`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function should consider all cows with higher ratings, not just up to two.
   - The logic for calculating the number of wins needs to be more robust to handle all possible positions of cows with higher ratings.

Given the analysis, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as intended. Specifically, it only considers up to two cows with higher ratings, which is insufficient.
