Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `a`, a list of integers `x`, and a non-negative integer `k`. The length of `a` and `x` is `n`, and the values in `x` are sorted in strictly increasing order with no zeros. The function returns `False` in all cases except one, where it returns `True`.**
