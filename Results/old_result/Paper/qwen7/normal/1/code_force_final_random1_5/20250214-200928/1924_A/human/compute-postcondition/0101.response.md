Output State: **`cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `cnt` is 1**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` simply reassigns the variable `cur` to 0. All other variables (`ans`, `s`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
