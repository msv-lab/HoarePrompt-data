Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop condition. Here, the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the State**: Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. Additionally, since `n` must be greater than 1, it remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. The value of `i` changes from 1 to 2, and `n` remains greater than 1. The value of `a[1]` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
