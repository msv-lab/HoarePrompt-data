Output State: **`current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `current`, `neighbor` is not in `visited`, and `visited` now includes `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code adds the `neighbor` node to the set `visited`. Since `neighbor` was not previously in `visited`, the set `visited` now contains `neighbor` in addition to any nodes that were already present. The other conditions remain unchanged.
