Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `best` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is 5
   - `res` is an input string, and its current value is '<'

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `best` remains 1.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 6.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `k` remains 5.
   - `res` remains an input string with its current value being '<'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`best` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `i` is 2, `k` is 5, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'**
