State: **`impossible` is True, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be a positive integer, meaning `n` must be greater than 1.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` must be initialized to 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.
4. The initial values of `impossible` and `ans` do not affect the loop's execution, so they remain as given.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` must be 0.
