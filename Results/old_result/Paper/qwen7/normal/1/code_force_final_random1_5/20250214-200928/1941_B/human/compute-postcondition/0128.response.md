Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the given code snippet, all the original conditions and values remain the same, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional structure.
