Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values of These Variables**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - `n` is given as `len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Check the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, n]`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments, the loop will execute as long as `i <= n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is 1 initially (since the loop starts with `i = 1`).
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is such that the loop can execute, i.e., `n >= 1`.

5. **Consider the Given State**:
   - `tc` is an input integer (not relevant for the loop execution).
   - `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, so we don't need to change this.
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order followed by 0 (not relevant for the loop execution).
   - `dp` is set to `True` (not relevant for the loop execution).

Given these points, the only states that need adjustment are `i` and `n`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` should be at least 1.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
