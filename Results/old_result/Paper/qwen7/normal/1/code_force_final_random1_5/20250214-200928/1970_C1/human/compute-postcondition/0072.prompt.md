Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their respective distances from the `start` node. The `current` variable holds the node currently being processed from the `queue`, and `dist` holds the distance from the `start` node to `current`. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, starting from the `start` node and including all its neighbors and their neighbors, up to the point where the `queue` is fully processed. The `target` node, which is one of the two leaves of the tree, has also been included in the `visited` set if it has been reached or encountered during the traversal. The `neighbor` variable represents the next node to be processed, which is added to the `queue` with an incremented distance (`dist + 1`) if it hasn't been visited yet.

In summary, the `queue` will contain all nodes that can still be traversed along with their distances from the start node, `current` will be the next node to process from the `queue`, `dist` will be the distance to `current`, `visited` will include all nodes that have been explored, and `neighbor` will represent the next unvisited node to be added to the `queue`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: All nodes in the tree have been visited, `current` is the `target` node, and `dist` represents the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `visited` set contains every node in the tree, and the `queue` is empty since all nodes have been processed.

This means that the loop has successfully traversed the entire tree, finding the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `visited` set ensures no node is processed more than once, and the `queue` is used to keep track of nodes to be processed, ensuring a breadth-first search approach. Once all nodes are visited and the `current` node becomes the `target`, the distance `dist` holds the shortest path length.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: All nodes in the tree have been visited, and for each node, the variable `dist` holds the shortest distance from the start node to that node. The variable `queue` is empty, and `visited` contains all nodes in the tree. The variable `current` is set to `None` or a node that has no unvisited neighbors, indicating that the algorithm has finished traversing the entire tree.

This means that the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm has completed its traversal of the tree, with `dist` holding the shortest distances from the start node to all other nodes, and `queue` being empty since no more nodes need to be processed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
