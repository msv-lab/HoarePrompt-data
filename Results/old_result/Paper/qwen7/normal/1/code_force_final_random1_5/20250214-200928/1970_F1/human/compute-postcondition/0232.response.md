Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `comand` is equal to the list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `com` is the second element of `command`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `elements[obj]` to the variable `pos`. Here, `obj` is the first element of the list `command`, which was read from standard input and stripped. The values of `t`, `time`, `command`, `comand`, and `com` remain unchanged.
