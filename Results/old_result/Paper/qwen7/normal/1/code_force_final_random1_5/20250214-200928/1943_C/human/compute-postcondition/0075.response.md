Postcondition: **`ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci` if `len(path_ba)` is odd. Otherwise, `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `ops` is a list containing twelve tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4), (c1, 6), (c2, 6), (c1, 8), (c2, 8), (c1, 10), (c2, 10), (c1, 12), (c2, 12))`, and `i` is 12.**

This means that if the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` for each integer `i` from `0` to `ci`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` will contain twelve specific tuples as described, and `i` will be 12.
