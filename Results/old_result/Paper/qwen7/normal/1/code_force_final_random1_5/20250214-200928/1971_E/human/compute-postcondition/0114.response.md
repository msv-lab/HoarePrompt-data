Postcondition: `l` is a value within the range [0, `ql`), `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, we continue the loop or iteration. If `a[s]` is not equal to `ql`, no change occurs in the variables.
