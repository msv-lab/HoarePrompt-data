Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes integers t, n, and k. It returns information based on the conditions given for these integers.**

- For each test case, the function processes integers t, n, and k where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- If t is within the specified range, the function evaluates n and k and returns information based on their values.
- If t is out of the specified range, the function would return an error or handle it according to the problem's requirements.
