Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `newk` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `newk = k // 2` calculates `newk` as half of `k` (integer division), but it does not affect any other variables. The values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `t`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
