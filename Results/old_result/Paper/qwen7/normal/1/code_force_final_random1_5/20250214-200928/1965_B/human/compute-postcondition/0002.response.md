Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The variables involved here are `func_10()` and `_`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`). At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed one time, meaning `func_10()` returned a value of at least 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1 again. Since `_` is an underscore, it is typically used as a throwaway variable and does not affect the state directly. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`, which must be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `sys.stdout.write` outputs the result of `func_14()` followed by a newline at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sys.stdout.write` outputs the result of `func_14()` followed by a newline, and `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1**.
