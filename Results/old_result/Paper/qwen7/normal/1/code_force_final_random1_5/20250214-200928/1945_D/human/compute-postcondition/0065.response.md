Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for c in range(cases)`. The variables involved here are `c`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` contains the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `na_frente` is 0.
   - `pos_final` is 0.
   - `v` is -1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `c` is less than `cases`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `c` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `c` will be 1.
   - The values of `total`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `v` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` contains the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is 0, and `v` is -1**.
