Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; `n` and `k` are the results of `func_4()` call.**

The code `n, k = func_4()` calls the function `func_4()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since the exact behavior of `func_4()` is not provided, we can only state that `n` and `k` are the results of this function call, maintaining their respective constraints.
