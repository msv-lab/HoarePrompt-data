Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is `v - 2`, `c` is 2, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`**.

The code updates the `total` variable by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The values of `na_frente`, `v`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
