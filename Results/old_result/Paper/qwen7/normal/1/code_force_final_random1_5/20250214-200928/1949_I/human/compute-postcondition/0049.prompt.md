You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n, where for each 0 ≤ i < n, x[i], y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. visited is a list of boolean values of length n initialized to False. coef is a list of length n initialized to None.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, which will be `n-1`. For each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` will be integers from the input. The values of `visited`, `coef`, and the initial conditions for `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain as they were initialized.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: All nodes from 0 to n-1 have been processed, meaning `visited[i]` is True for every `i` in the range of `n`. The value of `coef[i]` is 1 for every `i` where `visited[i]` is True. The value of `tot` is the sum of all non-zero contributions made during the DFS calls for each component. `bipartite` is True for each component where the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not zero. `ok` is True if any component is bipartite and `tot` is not zero.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: All nodes from 0 to n-1 have been processed, meaning `visited[i]` is True for every `i` in the range of `n`. The value of `coef[i]` is 1 for every `i` where `visited[i]` is True. The value of `tot` is the sum of all non-zero contributions made during the DFS calls for each component. `bipartite` is True for each component where the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not zero. `ok` is True if any component is bipartite and `tot` is not zero. If the condition `ok` is True, then `ok` remains True. If `ok` is False, then `ok` remains False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined lists n, x, y, r, visited, and coef. It processes these lists based on certain conditions and does not return any value explicitly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
