Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `rev[z].pop()`, `x` is 0, `one` is False, `two` is True**

Explanation: The code `two = not two` simply toggles the value of `two`. Since `two` was initially `False`, after executing this line, `two` becomes `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
