Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is -100, `lst` is [3]**.

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `lst` now contains the value 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
