Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c**

Explanation: The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True, which means the distribution of the elements into `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` satisfies the condition specified by `func_1`. Additionally, the function returns a tuple containing the string `'YES'` and the three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, which contain the elements from the original `numbers` list divided as described.
