Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of times two fireworks, with launch frequencies `a` and `b`, need to be launched so that both fireworks are visible simultaneously for at least `m` units of time. If `a` and `b` are not both equal to 1 and `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, it adds one to the result. Otherwise, it simply sums the divisions.**
