The code appends 'YES' to the list `results`. This means that the value of `results` changes from its initial state to include the string 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 7, `l` is int(data[idx]), `r` is int(data[idx + 1]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `results` is ['YES'], and `it2` is bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1.**
