Output State: **`i` is 0; `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0; `curr` is `curr - 1`; `ans` is initialized.**

The value of `curr` is decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `i`, `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, and `ans` stay the same as the initial state.
