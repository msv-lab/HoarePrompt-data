Output State: `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, `y` remains 0, and `c` is the last element in the `custos` list after all iterations have completed.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `custos` will contain the cumulative sum of `custo` values from all iterations, `y` will still be 0 as it was not modified within the loop, and `c` will be the last element that was printed, which is the last value processed in the `custos` list.
