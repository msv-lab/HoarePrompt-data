Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations. This value is not explicitly named in the loop, but it is derived from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
   - `a` is an integer greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `k` is a list containing the integer 1
   - `b` is a string containing the character '1'

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` provides a valid non-negative integer. Since `i` is 0 at the start of the loop, the first input will determine how many times the loop runs.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the input must provide a positive integer (since `a` is already greater than 0 and `i` is 0, the loop will run once for each positive integer input).

Given that the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the state needs to be adjusted based on the next input value. Let's denote this new input value as `new_input`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not directly involved in the loop control.
   - `a` remains unchanged since it is not directly involved in the loop control.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 if the loop runs again.
   - `k` remains unchanged since it is not directly involved in the loop control.
   - `b` remains unchanged since it is not directly involved in the loop control.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the new input value `new_input` for the loop condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is a list containing the integer 1, `b` is a string containing the character '1', and the input value for the next iteration is a positive integer**.
