You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list where each element `dp[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for all `i` from 3 to `n`. After executing all iterations of the loop, the value of `i` will be `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the maximum index in the `dp` array, which is `n`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` array will contain values calculated according to the given formula for each index from 3 to `n`, with all other variables remaining in their initial or updated states as described.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and returns nothing.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
