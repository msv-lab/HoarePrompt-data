Based on the initial state provided:

- `nx` is a string consisting of 'S' and 'F' based on the conditions met during each iteration.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `j` is 3 after the loop completes.

However, the value of `nx` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, and no loop or condition that would generate `nx` is provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact content of the string `nx`.

Given the information, the only variable whose value is explicitly stated and can be used in the output is `j`, which is 3.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string consisting of 'S' and 'F' based on the conditions met during each iteration, and j is 3)**
