Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is `curr + 1` and equals the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 2, `ans` is 2 if `curr >= k`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**
