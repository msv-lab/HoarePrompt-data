Output State: **`i` is `n + n`, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
