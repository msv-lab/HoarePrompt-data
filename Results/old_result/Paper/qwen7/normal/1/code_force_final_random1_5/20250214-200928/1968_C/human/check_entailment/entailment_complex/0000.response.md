Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \( a \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).
2. The provided solution initializes \( a[0] \) to 1000 and sets each subsequent element \( a[i] \) to \( a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).
3. This approach ensures that \( a_i > a_{i-1} \) for all \( i \), which is necessary for the modulo operation to yield \( x_i \) as specified.
4. However, the key issue is whether this approach guarantees that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

Let's analyze the correctness:
- For \( i = 2 \): \( a_2 = a_1 + x_1 \). Given \( a_1 = 1000 \) and \( x_1 \leq 500 \), \( a_2 \) will be at least 1500.
- For \( i = 3 \): \( a_3 = a_2 + x_2 \). Since \( a_2 \geq 1500 \) and \( x_2 \leq 500 \), \( a_3 \) will be at least 2000.
- This pattern continues, ensuring that \( a_i \) grows sufficiently large compared to \( a_{i-1} \) and \( x_{i-1} \).

Given the constraints \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) and the initial value \( a_0 = 1000 \), the proposed solution will satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) because \( a_i \) will always be large enough relative to \( a_{i-1} \) to ensure the modulo operation yields \( x_i \).

Therefore, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
