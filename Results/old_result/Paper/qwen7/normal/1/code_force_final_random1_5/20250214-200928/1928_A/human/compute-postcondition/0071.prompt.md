Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
            if a1 != b:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        if b % 2 == 0:
            b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
            if b1 != a:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        print('No')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input. If `a` is even or `b` is even, `b` is divided by 2 resulting in `b1` and `b2` both being `b // 2`, and either `b1` is not equal to `a` or `b1` equals `a`, in which case no changes are made to `t`. If both `a` and `b` are odd, no changes are made to `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input. If `a` or `b` is even, `a1` is an integer from the input, `a2` is an integer from the input, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`. If `b1` is equal to `a`, the loop does not continue. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, we continue the loop or process. If `a` or `b` is not even, `t` remains greater than 0 - 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, `a1` equals `a2` which are both `a/2`, `b1` equals `b2` which are both `b//2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, then `t` is greater than 0, `a` is `a/2`, and `b` is `b//2`; otherwise, `t` is greater than 0 - 1, `a` and `b` remain their original input values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
