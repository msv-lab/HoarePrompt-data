Output State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `dp` will be updated based on the final condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`. All other variables (`tc` and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
