Output State: **`gr` is now a list with its last element being the input value, `i` is `n+2`, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` and `impossible` remain the same.**

Explanation: The code appends the input value to the list `gr`. The value of `i` is defined as `n+2`, which means it is `n+2` regardless of the input. The values of `n`, `ans`, and `impossible` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
