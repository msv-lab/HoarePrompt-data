Postcondition: `ind` is now equal to the index of the last character in `line`, and the following changes occur:
- If `line[ind]` is not equal to `'..'`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`.
- If `line[ind]` is a player (i.e., `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true), then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `True`.
- If `line[ind]` is a player and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, then `tmp` is set to `0` and `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`.
- No additional changes occur if `line[ind][1]` is not `'G'`.
