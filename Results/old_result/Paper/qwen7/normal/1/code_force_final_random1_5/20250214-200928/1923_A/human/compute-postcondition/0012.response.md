Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `_` is 0, `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `y` to be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `y` now reflects the position of the first '1' from the end of the original string `arr`.
