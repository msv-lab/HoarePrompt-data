Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a sorted string of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the string `s` and assigns the sorted string to `b`. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `b` is created and holds the sorted version of the input string `s`.
