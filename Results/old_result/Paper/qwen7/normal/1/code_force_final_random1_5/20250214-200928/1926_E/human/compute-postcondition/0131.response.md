Postcondition: **`i` is either 4 or 0, `n` is the first input number, `k` is the second input number, `s` is 3 if `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is 4, `f` is `k - 3` if `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `f` is `k - g`, `y` is 15 if `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `y` is 2, `g` is 3 if `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `g` is 0.**
