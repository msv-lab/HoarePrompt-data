Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index in the range of the length of `line`. Therefore, `ind` will be incremented by 1 with each iteration.

3. **Determine the state changes**: Based on the postcondition given, the following changes occur at the end of each iteration:
   - `ind` is 1 more than the previous value.
   - `elements[line[ind]]` is updated based on certain conditions.
   - `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged.
   - If `line[ind]` is not `..`, `elements[line[ind]]` is updated.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
   - Otherwise, `tmp` is determined based on the first character of `line[ind]`, and `goal[tmp]` appends `(i, ind)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ind` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `ind` will be `ind + 1`.
   - `line` remains unchanged.
   - `elements`, `tmp`, `goal`, and `allPlayers` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `ind`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`line` is a string, `ind` is 1 more than the previous value, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`, `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` remains unchanged if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, otherwise `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`**.

However, since the only variable that changes is `ind`, we can simplify the answer to focus on that change:

**State: **`ind` is 1 more than the previous value, `line` is a string, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`, `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` remains unchanged if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, otherwise `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`**.
