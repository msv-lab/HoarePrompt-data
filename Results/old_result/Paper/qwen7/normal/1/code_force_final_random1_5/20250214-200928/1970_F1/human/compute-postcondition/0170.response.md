Output State: **`team` is the value of `goalIn(pos)`, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, `points[team]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `points[team] += 1` increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
