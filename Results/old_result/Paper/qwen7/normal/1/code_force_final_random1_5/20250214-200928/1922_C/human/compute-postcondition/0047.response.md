Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 0, and `d2[0]` is the final value calculated based on the conditions within the loop.**

The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `m`. The values of `i` and `d2[0]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
