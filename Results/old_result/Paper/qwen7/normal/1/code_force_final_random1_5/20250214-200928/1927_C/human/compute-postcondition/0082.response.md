Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
