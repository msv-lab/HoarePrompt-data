Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `nx` is either equal to `xx[1][1]` if `xx[1][1]` is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if `xx[1][1]` is '?'
   - `j` is 2
   - `nx` is either 'FF' if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4]` and `j` is in `sa[:n // 4]`, or 'S' otherwise
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1

3. **Determine the Next Values for `j` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `j` set to 1 and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 3.

4. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `j` is currently 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can continue if `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `j` will be updated to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nx` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is updated to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `nx` is either equal to `xx[1][1]` if `xx[1][1]` is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if `xx[1][1]` is '?', and `j` is 3**
