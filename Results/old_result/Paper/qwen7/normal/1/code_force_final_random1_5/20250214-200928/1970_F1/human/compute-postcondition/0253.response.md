Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `comand` is equal to the list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is either the first element of the `command` list or the value of `nxt`, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is either the third element of the `command` list or `None`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `team` is either 1 if the first element of the `command` list starts with 'B' or 0, `points[team]` is incremented by 10 if `el` is equal to '.Q' or if the player is identified and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, otherwise `points[team]` remains unchanged.
