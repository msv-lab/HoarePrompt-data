Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each element `ai` in the list `a`. Therefore, the relevant objects in the loop head are `ai`, `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.
   - `ai` is the current element being processed in the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Once `a` is empty, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers, we need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `ai` will take on the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty before the loop starts. Additionally, since `ai` will be the first element of the list during the first iteration, we need to set `ai` to the first element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- Ensure that the list `a` is not empty.
- Set `ai` to the first element of the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `year` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces that must not be empty, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`**
