Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1, and `ans` is 3.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 2, after this operation, `ans` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `curr`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
