Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. The game rules dictate that the player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- The solution uses a function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Specifically, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, `func_1` returns 'Bob', otherwise it returns 'Alice'.
- The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)` and printing the result.
- Given the problem description and the execution summary, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the game rules.
- According to the game rules, the key factor in determining the winner is whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. This is because the game alternates turns, and the player who faces an even sum of coins will eventually be forced into a situation where they cannot make a valid move (i.e., when the sum becomes zero).
- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This aligns with the game rules since the player who faces an even sum will eventually lose.
- Therefore, the implementation in `func_1` and `func_2` accurately reflects the game rules and logic.

Correctness: **True**
