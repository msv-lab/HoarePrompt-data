Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`**.

This output state indicates that `i` has been incremented by 1, while the relationships and conditions involving `new2[i]`, `new[i]`, and `a[1]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
