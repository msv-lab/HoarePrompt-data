Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to `array2`. The new element is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 4, the expression becomes `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the state of `array2` before the operation are preserved, but `array2` now contains one more element as specified.
