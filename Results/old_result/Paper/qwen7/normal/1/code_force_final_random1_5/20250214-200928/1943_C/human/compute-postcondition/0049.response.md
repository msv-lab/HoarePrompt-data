Postcondition: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0 with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`. The length of `path_ba` is odd. `ops` is an empty list.**
