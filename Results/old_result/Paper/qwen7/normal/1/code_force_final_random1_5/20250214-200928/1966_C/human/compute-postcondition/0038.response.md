Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is True.**

Explanation: The code sets `n` to the length of `arr` minus one. Since `arr` is a list of integers in descending order followed by 0, its length remains unchanged. The other variables (`tc`, `arr`, and `dp`) are not affected by this operation.
