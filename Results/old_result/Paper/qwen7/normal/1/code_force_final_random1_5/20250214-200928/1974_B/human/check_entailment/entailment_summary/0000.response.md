Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose**: The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `s`. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not actually decode the string. Instead, it creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and then replaces each character in `b` with the corresponding character from this list. This approach does not reverse the encoding process as required.

2. **Decoding Logic**: To decode, we need to map each character in the encoded string back to its original character based on the reverse mapping of the unique characters. The provided function does not establish this reverse mapping correctly.

3. **Correct Implementation**: We need to create a mapping from the unique characters in the encoded string to their positions in the original alphabetically sorted list of unique characters. Then, for each character in the encoded string, we should replace it with the character at the position determined by the reverse mapping.

Given these points, the provided program does not perform the necessary steps to decode the string correctly.

Correctness: **False**
