Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is '?'. If either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, then `nx` is 'S'.
