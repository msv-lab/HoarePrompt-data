### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Each player alternates turns.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep them.
   - After each move, one coin is removed from the player's current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, the first player (Alice) will lose if both players play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) will win if both players play optimally.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
   - The logic here is correct. If the sum is even, Alice will eventually be left with zero coins and thus lose. If the sum is odd, Alice will always have a move after Bob, ensuring she can force a win.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to determine the winner.
   - It prints the results for each test case.
   - The implementation here is also correct. It processes each test case correctly and prints the results.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations provided in the code align with the actual behavior of the functions.
   - The state transitions and outputs match the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement. The annotations support the correctness of the functions.
