Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. Since `a[i]` was previously set to `a[i] - 2 * opNum`, substituting `opNum` with `a[i]` gives us `a[i]` is now `a[i] - 2 * a[i]`, which simplifies to `-a[i]`. Similarly, `a[i + 1]` is now `a[i + 1] - 3 * a[i]`, and `a[i + 2]` is now `a[i + 2] - 2 * a[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `_` remains unchanged as it was initialized to 0. The value of `stop` remains `True` as no condition to change it was provided in the code snippet.
