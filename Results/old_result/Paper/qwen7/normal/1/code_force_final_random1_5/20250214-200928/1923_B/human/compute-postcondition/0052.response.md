Output State: **`rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` remains unchanged, `pos` is `pos + 1`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: 
- The initial state shows that `rest` is now equal to `rest - delta - delta`, which simplifies to `rest - 2*delta`.
- `delta` remains unchanged.
- `pos` is incremented by 1.
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.

Therefore, after executing `pos += 1`, the updated values are as described above.
