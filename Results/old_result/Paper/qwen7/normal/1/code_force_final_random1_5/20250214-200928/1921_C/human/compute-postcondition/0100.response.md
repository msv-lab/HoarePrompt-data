Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is `tc`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `array2` contains elements based on the specified conditions**

Explanation: The code `feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `feat`. As a result, `i` (which was previously `n`) and `n` both now hold the value of the first element of `feat`. The `test_cases` (`tc`) and `array2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
