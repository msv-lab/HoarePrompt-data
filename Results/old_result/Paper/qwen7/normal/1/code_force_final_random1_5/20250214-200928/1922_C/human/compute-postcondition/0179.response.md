Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `d2[n-1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` based on the formula `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is initially `n-4`, and `d2[n-1]` is 1. The other variables (`l`, `i`, and `d2`) are updated according to the given formula, but their exact values are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the new value of `d2[i]` is expressed in terms of the known values and the formula.
