Based on the initial state provided:

- `pk` remains unchanged.
- `mini` remains unchanged.
- `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order.
- If the current value of `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `final` contains an additional element `n` appended to it.

We need to determine what `final[0]` will be when the print statement executes.

Let's break it down:

1. `final` is initially a sorted version of `lst`.
2. Depending on the value of `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`), `final` will either have an additional `0` or `n` appended to it.

However, the value of `final[0]` is determined solely by the sorted version of `lst`, regardless of the appended element. Therefore, `final[0]` will be the smallest element in the sorted list `lst`.

Output: **the smallest element in the sorted list lst**
