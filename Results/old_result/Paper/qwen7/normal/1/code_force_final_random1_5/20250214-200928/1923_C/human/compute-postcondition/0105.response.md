Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `s = p[b] - p[a - 1]` does not change the value of `i` or `m`. It updates the value of `s` to be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, which is already its initial value. Therefore, the values of `i`, `s`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
