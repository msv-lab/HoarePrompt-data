Output State: **`j` must be between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F'; `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. The conditions for `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the value of `x[j - 1]` remains 'F'.
