Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `one` is 3, and `one_perc` is -200; `zero_perc` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to be `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Given the initial state where `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `i` is 3, we can calculate `zero_perc` as follows:

- If `zero` is 0, then `zero_perc` is `0 * 100 // (3 + 1) = 0`.
- If `zero` is 1, then `zero_perc` is `1 * 100 // (3 + 1) = 25`.
- If `zero` is 2, then `zero_perc` is `2 * 100 // (3 + 1) = 50`.

However, since `zero_perc` is initially either 0, 100, or 50, the only value that fits the calculation and the initial condition is 0. Therefore, `zero_perc` is updated to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
