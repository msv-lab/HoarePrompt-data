The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration where `j` is 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 2. Therefore, `m` can remain the same as it was before because the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`.

State: **`j` is 2, `m` is a positive integer**
