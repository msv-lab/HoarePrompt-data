Postcondition: **`final` is sorted, if `final` has a length of 0, it remains unchanged, if `final` has a length of 1, it contains either 0 or the value of `n`, `c1` is less than 50, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`**.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `n % 2 == 0` is true or false, the conditions specified in both the if and else parts remain unchanged. Therefore, the overall postcondition retains all the conditions mentioned in both parts.
