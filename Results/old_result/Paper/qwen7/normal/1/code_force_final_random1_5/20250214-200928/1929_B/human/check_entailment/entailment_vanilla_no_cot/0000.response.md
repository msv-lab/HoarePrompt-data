Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided solution correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored based on the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - For an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
   - Sasha wants at least \( k \) diagonals to have at least one colored cell.
   - He wants to minimize the number of cells colored.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each cell can belong to up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
   - To cover \( k \) diagonals, we need to color enough cells such that each diagonal is covered at least once.

3. **Solution Logic**:
   - If \( 4n - 2 = k \), then every diagonal must be covered, and the minimum number of cells needed is \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) because each cell covers 2 diagonals.
   - Otherwise, the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

4. **Implementation**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( 4n - 2 = k \) and prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) if true.
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

This logic ensures that the solution is correct for all given test cases. The provided examples and the output match the expected results, confirming the correctness of the program.
