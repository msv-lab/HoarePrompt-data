Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted into `v2` to keep the list sorted.**

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` using `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. This means `it2` is the position where `r - 1` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain the sorted order of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
