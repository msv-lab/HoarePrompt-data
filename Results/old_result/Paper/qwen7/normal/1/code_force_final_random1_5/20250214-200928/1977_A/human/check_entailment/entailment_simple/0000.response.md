Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. The program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:
   - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes". This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - If `m > n`, it prints "No". This is correct because Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves he makes.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes". This is correct because Nikita can add one cube per move except for the last move where he removes one cube.
   - If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes". This is correct because Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs, ending up with `m` cubes.
   - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes". This is correct because Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs, and the last move can be adding a cube, ending up with `m` cubes.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No". This covers all other cases where it's not possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given these observations, the program logic matches the problem description and handles all possible scenarios correctly.
