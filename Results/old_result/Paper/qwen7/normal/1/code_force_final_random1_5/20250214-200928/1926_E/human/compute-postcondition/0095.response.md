Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 32, `m` is 1, `n` must be non-zero, `m` is calculated as (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` must be non-zero, `m` will be the integer division of `(n + 1)` by 2. However, without a specific value for `n`, we can only express `m` in terms of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
