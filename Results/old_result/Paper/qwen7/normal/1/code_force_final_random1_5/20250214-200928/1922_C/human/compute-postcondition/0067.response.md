Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` in the range specified by `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop runs for each integer input provided by the user. The variable `i` takes on values starting from 0 up to `m-1`, where `m` is the number of iterations.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are integers from the input for each iteration. Additionally, if `y` is greater than `x` during any iteration, the difference `d1[y] - d1[x]` is printed; otherwise, the difference `d2[y] - d2[x]` is printed. The values of `m` and `j` do not change regardless of the conditions inside the loop.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `m` and `j` do not change, they remain the same as in the previous iteration.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `m` remains the same (greater than 0).
- `j` remains the same (`m-1`).
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `i` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers from the input for each iteration, and the conditions for printing differences based on `x` and `y` are the same as before.**
