Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is a list with the value `[.B]`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, and `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`**.

This postcondition describes that after the execution of the if-else block, `t` remains an integer greater than 0, `time` remains 0, `command` remains a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is a list with the value `[.B]`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, and `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
