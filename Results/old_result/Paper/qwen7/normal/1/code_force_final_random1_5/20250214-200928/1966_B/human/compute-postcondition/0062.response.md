Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `tc` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `gr` is a list containing one element (an input string)
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and 'YES' otherwise
   - `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]' holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`
   - `n` must be a positive integer

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `n-1` and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently `n-1`

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - After the current iteration, `i` will become `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `n`.
   - Since `n` is a constant, it remains unchanged.
   - The conditions for `ans` and `impossible` depend on the values within the list `gr` and the relationship between elements at specific indices.

7. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be `n` (since `i` is incremented by 1).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The conditions for `ans` and `impossible` remain the same as they depend on the values in `gr` and the relationship between elements at specific indices.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing one element (an input string), `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]' holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, `n` must be a positive integer**
