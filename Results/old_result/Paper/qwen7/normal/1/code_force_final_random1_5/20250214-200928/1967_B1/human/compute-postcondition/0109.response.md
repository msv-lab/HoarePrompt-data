Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values through variables t, n, and m, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6. The function returns a result based on these values, ensuring the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
