Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `len(set_)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `A` is True
   - `arr[0]` is 1
   - `set_` is [1]
   - `i` is 1
   - `not_c` is False

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(set_)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(set_)`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `len(set_)` is 1 (since `set_` is [1]).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `len(set_)` must remain 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `A` remains True.
   - `arr[0]` remains 1.
   - `set_` remains [1].
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `not_c` remains False.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False**
