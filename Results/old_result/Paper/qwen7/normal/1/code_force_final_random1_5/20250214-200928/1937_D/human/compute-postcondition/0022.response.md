Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 4, 2]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 2], `i` is 2**.

Explanation: Initially, `idx_A` contains `[0, 2]`. The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `idx_A`. Therefore, `idx_A` becomes `[0, 2, 2]`. The values of `s`, `A`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
