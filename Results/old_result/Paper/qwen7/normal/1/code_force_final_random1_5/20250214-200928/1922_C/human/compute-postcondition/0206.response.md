Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` will be equal to the total number of iterations (`m`), `x` and `y` are integers from the input for each iteration, and both `d1` and `d2` dictionaries will contain values calculated based on the input list `l`. If `y` is greater than `x` during any iteration, the difference `d1[y] - d1[x]` is printed; otherwise, the difference `d2[y] - d2[x]` is printed. The values of `m` and `j` do not change regardless of the conditions inside the loop. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` will store the cumulative differences as described in the loop body, and these values will be used to compute the outputs for each query provided in the input.
