Output State: `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 3`. The condition `if a[i] < 0:` causes `stop` to become `True` and breaks out of the loop as soon as any element in the array `a` becomes negative or when `i` reaches `n - 2`. The variable `opNum` will be the value of `a[i]` at the last iteration, and the subsequent elements `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` will be updated according to the operations performed within the loop.
