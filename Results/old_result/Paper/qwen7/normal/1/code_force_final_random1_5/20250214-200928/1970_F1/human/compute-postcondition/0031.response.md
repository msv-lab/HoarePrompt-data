Output State: **`ind` is 1 or 2, `tmp` is 0, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `len(line)` remains the same, `line[ind]` is not `'..', `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, `goal[tmp]` now contains `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `tmp` is 0, the tuple `(i, ind)` is added to `goal[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
