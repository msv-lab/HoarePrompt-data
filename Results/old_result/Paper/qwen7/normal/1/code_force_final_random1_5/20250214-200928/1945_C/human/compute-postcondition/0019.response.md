Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`, and `zero` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `zero += 1` increments the value of `zero` by 1. Initially, `zero` is assumed to be 0 (since no prior value is given), so after executing the code, `zero` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
