The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it checks the relationship between \(n\) and \(m\) and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
