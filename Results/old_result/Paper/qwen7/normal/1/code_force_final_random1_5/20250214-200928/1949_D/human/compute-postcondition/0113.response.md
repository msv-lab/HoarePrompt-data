Postcondition: `i` is 1, `xx` contains `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are lists where `a[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'F' at the `j-th` position across all inputs and `b[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'S' at the `j-th` position across all inputs, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is an empty list, and for the current value of `i`, `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0.
