Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order followed by 0.**

Explanation:
- The code takes a string input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, removes duplicates using `set()`, sorts the resulting list in descending order using `sorted()` with `reverse=True`, and appends `0` to the end of the list.
- The initial values of `tc` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `arr` is created and its value depends on the input string. However, without a specific input, we can only describe `arr` in general terms as a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by `0`.
