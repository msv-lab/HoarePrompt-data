Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is the count of '1's in the original string `b` plus the count of '1's in the new input string `b`, `b` is the new input string from the user, `num` is the new positive integer provided by the user, and if the new input string `b` contains the character '1', then `k` is updated to include the count of '1's in the new input string `b`.**
