Postcondition: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order, the first element in the list `gap` is the second odd number in the list, `ans` is increased by either twice the value of `y` (if `y < gap / 2` is true) or the value of the second odd number (if `y < gap / 2` is false), `y` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
