Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the relevant variables**: The only variable involved in the loop head is `i`. The other variables (`tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, `tmp`) are not directly involved in the loop condition.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(a)`. This means `i` should start from 1 and go up to the length of the list `a` minus 1.

4. **Initial state of `i`**: According to the given state before the loop, `i` is initially 0.

5. **Adjust the initial state**: To ensure the loop starts correctly, `i` needs to be set to 1 (the starting value of the loop).

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1**
