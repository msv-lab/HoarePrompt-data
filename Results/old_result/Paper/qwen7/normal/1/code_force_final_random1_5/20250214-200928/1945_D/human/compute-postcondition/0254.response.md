Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in custos:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the `custos` list, assigning the current element to the variable `c`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, excluding the previously processed value.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `c` is the next element in the `custos` list.

3. **Understand what happens during the loop iteration**:
   - The loop assigns the next element from the `custos` list to `c`.
   - Since `c` is the next element in the `custos` list, it means that `c` will be the next value in the sequence of `custos`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `custos` remains the same as it is a list and does not change within the loop.
   - `y` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `c` will now be the next element in the `custos` list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, excluding the previously processed value, `y` is 0, `c` is the next element in the `custos` list**. 

However, since `c` is the next element in the `custos` list, we can simplify the description of `c` to reflect its new value.

Final State:
State: **`custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, excluding the previously processed value, `y` is 0, `c` is the next element in the `custos` list (which is the next value in the sequence)**.
