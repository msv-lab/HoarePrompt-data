You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the top-left cell is the same as the bottom-right cell. If they differ, it further checks if the first row or the last column can be uniform without changing the top-left and bottom-right cells. Based on these checks, it determines whether it's possible to make the top-left and bottom-right cells the same by flipping rows or columns, and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It reads the grid itself row by row.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program assumes that if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is a critical assumption.

3. **Checking Corners:**
   - The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) have the same color.
   - If they don't, it sets `ans` to 'NO' and proceeds no further.

4. **Horizontal and Vertical Checks:**
   - The program then checks if all horizontal and vertical segments from the top-left to the bottom-right have the same color.
   - If any segment has different colors at the edges, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' if it passes all checks, otherwise 'NO'.

### Reasoning:

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly identifies the edge case where the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, making it impossible to unify the entire grid.
  - However, the program incorrectly assumes that if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, the entire grid can always be made uniform. This is not necessarily true.

- **Counterexample:**
  - Consider a 2x2 grid:
    ```
    BB
    WB
    ```
  - Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same ('B'), but it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform using the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the grid can still be unified even if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
