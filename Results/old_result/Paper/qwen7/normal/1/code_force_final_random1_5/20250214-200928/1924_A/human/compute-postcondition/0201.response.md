Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes inputs through variables where t is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. For each test case, n and k are integers between 1 and 26 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
