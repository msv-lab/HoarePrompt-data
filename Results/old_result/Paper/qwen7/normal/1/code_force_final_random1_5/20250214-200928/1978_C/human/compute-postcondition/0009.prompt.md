You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5} and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}.
def func_6():
    n, k = func_4()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.
    #State: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; `n` and `k` are the results of `func_4()` call, and `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program returns the value of `l` which is the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It first calls `func_1(n, k)` with parameters `n` and `k`, where both are integers and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5} and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. Then it calls `func_5` with the result of `func_1(n, k)` as its argument. Finally, it returns the value of `l`, which is the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `l` which is the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
