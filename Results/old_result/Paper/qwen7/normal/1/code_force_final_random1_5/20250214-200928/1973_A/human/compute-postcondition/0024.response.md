The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1` appended to the original list, and `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple from `cas_de_test`.**
