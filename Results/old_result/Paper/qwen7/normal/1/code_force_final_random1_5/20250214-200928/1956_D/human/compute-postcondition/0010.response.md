Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over tuples in the list `ops`. The loop head variables are `l` and `r`, which are the first and second elements of these tuples, respectively.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, and `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`.
   - `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`.
   - `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more tuples in `ops` to process.
   - After processing the current tuple `(l, r)`, the next tuple in `ops` will be used.
   - Therefore, `l` will become the first element of the next tuple in `ops`, and `r` will become the second element of the next tuple in `ops`.

4. **Determine the new values**:
   - Since `ops` contains at least one tuple, and we are currently processing the second tuple, the next tuple will be the third tuple in `ops`.
   - Let the third tuple in `ops` be `(l', r')`.
   - Thus, `l` will be updated to `l'`, and `r` will be updated to `r'`.

5. **Final state**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` remain unchanged.
   - `l` becomes the first element of the third tuple in `ops`.
   - `r` becomes the second element of the third tuple in `ops`.

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\), `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, and `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r). l` is the first element of the third tuple in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the third tuple in `ops.`**
