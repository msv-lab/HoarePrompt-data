Output State: **`total` is 0 plus the value at index `-2` of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -2.**

Explanation: The code updates `total` by adding the value at index `-2` of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `v` is `-2`, `total` is updated to `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`. The values of `na_frente`, `c`, `pos_final`, and `v` remain as they were initially.
