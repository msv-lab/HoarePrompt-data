Output State: **`c` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 5`, `k` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by 1, making `c` equal to 3. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `n` is still an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is still `n - 5`, `k` is still updated based on the new value of `i`, and `l` is still the result of `func_3(c, l)`.
