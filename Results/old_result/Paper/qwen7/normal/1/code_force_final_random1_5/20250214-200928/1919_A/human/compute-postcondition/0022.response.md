Output State: **`t` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have been executed, `t` will have been decremented to 0. Since `t` starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration, once `t` reaches 0, no more iterations will occur. Consequently, the `results` list will be empty because it was filled with `t` elements, one in each iteration, and `t` is now 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `winner` will remain as they were set in the last iteration of the loop, with `winner` being the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`.
