Output State: **`i` is 1; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[1]` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `idx` remains unspecified. The value of `a[1]` is still an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, reflecting its previous state before the increment. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
