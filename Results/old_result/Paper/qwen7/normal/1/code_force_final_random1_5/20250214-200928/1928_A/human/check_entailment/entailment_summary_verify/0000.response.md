### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob needs to determine if he can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90Â° rotation.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\).
- It checks the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\) and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on specific conditions.
- After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results directly.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Case 1: Both dimensions are even (`a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`)**:
   - The program correctly prints 'yes' because both dimensions can be halved.
   - Correct.

2. **Case 2: One dimension is 1**:
   - The program incorrectly prints 'no' because it does not check if the other dimension can be split into two equal parts.
   - For example, a 2x1 rectangle can be split into two 1x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x2 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original but rotated.
   - Incorrect.

3. **Case 3: One dimension is greater than the other and their difference is odd**:
   - The program incorrectly prints 'yes' because it does not properly handle the condition where the difference between the dimensions is odd.
   - For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be split into two 3x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.
   - Incorrect.

4. **Other Cases**:
   - The program uses a series of conditions to determine if a rectangle can be split and rearranged into a different rectangle. However, the logic is flawed in handling certain edge cases.
   - For example, the condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant and incorrect.

#### Example where the program fails:
- Input: `1 2`
- Expected Output: `Yes`
- Actual Output: `No`

The program fails to recognize that a 1x2 rectangle can be split into two 1x1 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original but rotated.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where one dimension is 1 and incorrectly handles the condition where the difference between the dimensions is odd.

**Final: False**
