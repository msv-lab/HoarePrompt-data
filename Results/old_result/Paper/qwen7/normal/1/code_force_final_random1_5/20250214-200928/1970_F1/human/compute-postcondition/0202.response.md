Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is set to 2.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped.
   - `com` is a string from the `command` list.
   - `obj` is a string from the `command` list.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, which means `pos` is a tuple representing the position of `obj` in the `elements` list.
   - `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. This means `nxt` represents the new position after moving according to the direction specified by `com`.
   - `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`.
   - `%d` is used to format `time` as an integer.
   - `%s` is used to format `player` as a string.

Given the above, let's determine the values:

- `time` is explicitly given as 2.
- `player` depends on the result of `isPlayer(obj)`. Since the exact value of `obj` and the contents of `isPlayer(obj)` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `player`. However, we know it will be either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `isPlayer(obj)` is False.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is either obj if isPlayer(obj) is True, or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] if isPlayer(obj) is False)**
