Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr + 1`, and `ans` is now equal to `ans + 1`.**

This means that `ans` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous conditions and values.
