Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly processes each test case as described in the problem statement.
2. It initializes variables and counts the number of '0's and '1's in the input string.
3. It iterates through the string to calculate the percentage of '0's and '1's up to each position and checks if both percentages meet the criteria of being at least 50%.
4. If such a position is found, it appends it to a list.
5. After processing all positions, it finds the position closest to the middle of the string (`pk`).
6. If no such position exists, it returns either the start or end of the string based on the majority count of '0's or '1's.
7. The final result is printed, which is the position closest to the middle satisfying the conditions.

Given the detailed analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
