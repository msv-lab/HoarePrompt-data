Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` and `b` retain their original values. If `l == 0`, then `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
