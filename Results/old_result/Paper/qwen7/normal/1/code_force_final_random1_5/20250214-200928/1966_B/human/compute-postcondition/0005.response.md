Output State: **`tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the input value to the list `gr`. Since the input is taken as a string, `gr` now contains one element, which is the input string. The other variables (`tc`, `n`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
