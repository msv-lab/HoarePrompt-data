Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer from the first split.
- `m` is an input integer from the second split.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`, but `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Either `m` is odd or `n` is odd.
- `(m % 2 == 0 or n % 2 == 0)`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
