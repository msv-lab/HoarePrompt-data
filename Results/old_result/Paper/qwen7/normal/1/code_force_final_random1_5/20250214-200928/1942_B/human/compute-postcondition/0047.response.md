Based on the initial state provided:

- After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-len(ar)`.
- `mex` will be the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)`.
- `res` will be a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`.

Let's break down the print statement:

```python
print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
```

This statement joins the elements of the list `res` into a single string with spaces between each element. Each element `x` in `res` is converted to a string using `str(x)`.

Given that `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`, the print statement will output a space-separated string of these values.

To summarize, the output will be a string consisting of the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

Output: **[mex - ar[0]] [mex - ar[1]] ... [mex - ar[n-1]]**
