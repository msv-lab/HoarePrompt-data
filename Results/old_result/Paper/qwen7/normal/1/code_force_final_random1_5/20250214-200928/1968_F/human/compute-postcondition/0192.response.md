Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and runs until `i < n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be at least 1, and `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - The state before the loop starts is given as follows:
     - `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
     - `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`.
     - `idx` is `4 * (n + 2)`.
     - `l` and `r` are the last integers from `data[idx]` and `data[idx + 1]` respectively.
     - `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
     - `v1` and `v2` are lists obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])` and `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` respectively.
     - `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to keep it sorted.
     - `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to keep it sorted minus one.
     - `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)`, with the last element being an empty string.
     - `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.
     - `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
     - `mp` is updated to `{(0): [0], (0): [0]}`.
     - No other changes.

4. **Adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 1.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to start.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
