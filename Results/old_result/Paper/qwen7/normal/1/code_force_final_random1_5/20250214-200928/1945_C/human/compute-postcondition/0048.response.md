Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1` (so `n > 4`), `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [3, 4]. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` becomes [3, 4]. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged as [3].
