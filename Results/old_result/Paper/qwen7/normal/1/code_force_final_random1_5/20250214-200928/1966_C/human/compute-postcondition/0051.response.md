Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a specific result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a number of piles represented by integers, and for each test case, it processes the data according to the specified constraints and returns a result related to those inputs.
