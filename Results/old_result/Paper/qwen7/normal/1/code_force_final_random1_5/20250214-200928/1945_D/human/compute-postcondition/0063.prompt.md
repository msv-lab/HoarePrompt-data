Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is 10000000000
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total`, `c`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` are integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`:
- If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `c` is reset to 0, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are each decremented by 1, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` initially. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.
- If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `c` is reset to 0, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are each decremented by 1, and `best` remains unchanged if `best` was not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
Otherwise (`v` is greater than `pos_final`):
- `total` is either `total` plus the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total` plus the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is 10000000000, and the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is compared to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to decide which cost to add to `total`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `total` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which cost is smaller. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `v` are integers. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and the values of `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `v` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and the values of `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `v` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
