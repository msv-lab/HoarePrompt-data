Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `l` is `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` has 'YES' appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
