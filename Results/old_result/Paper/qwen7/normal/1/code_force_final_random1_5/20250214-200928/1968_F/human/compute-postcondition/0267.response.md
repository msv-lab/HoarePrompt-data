Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 11`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is reassigned to `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted (previously calculated), `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is `['YES', 'YES']`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially `['YES']`, after appending `'YES'`, it becomes `['YES', 'YES']`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
