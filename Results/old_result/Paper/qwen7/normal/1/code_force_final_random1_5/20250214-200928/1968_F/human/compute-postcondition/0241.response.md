Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `l` is `data[idx]`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` converted to an integer to the variable `r`. The values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, and the value of `r` are updated accordingly. The initial state of `idx` being `idx + 2` and `l` being `data[idx]` remains unchanged except that now `r` holds the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.
