### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the input and initializes the grid, elements dictionary, players dictionary, goals, and points.
   - The `elements` dictionary maps each entity to its coordinates.
   - The `allPlayers` dictionary keeps track of whether a player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The `goal` list stores the coordinates of the goals for each team.
   - The `points` list keeps track of the scores for each team.

2. **Reading Input:**
   - The dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`) are read.
   - The grid is populated with entities.
   - The number of steps (`t`) is read.

3. **Processing Steps:**
   - For each step, the command is read and processed.
     - If the command involves catching or throwing the Quaffle, the appropriate actions are taken.
     - If the command involves moving, the player's new position is updated.
     - The function checks if the player has scored a goal and updates the score accordingly.

4. **Checking Validity:**
   - The function ensures that movements and actions are valid (e.g., a player cannot move out of bounds).
   - The function correctly handles the scoring logic and updates the points accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the events as they occur.
   - Finally, it prints the final score.

### Analysis:

- **Function Definitions and Initial Setup:**
  - The functions `goalIn` and `isPlayer` are defined correctly and are used appropriately within `func_1`.

- **Reading Input:**
  - The input reading process is correct and initializes the necessary data structures.

- **Processing Steps:**
  - The handling of player movements and actions (catching, throwing, and moving) is mostly correct. However, there are a few issues:
    - **Movement Validation:** The movement validation logic is incomplete. Specifically, the check `if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` should be `if isPlayer(obj) and grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] == '.B'` to ensure that a player cannot move onto a blue player.
    - **Quaffle Handling:** The handling of the Quaffle is incorrect. The Quaffle should only be moved when a player is carrying it and throws it. The current implementation allows the Quaffle to be moved without a player carrying it, which is invalid.
    - **Goal Scoring:** The goal scoring logic is correct, but the elimination logic is flawed. A player should be eliminated only if they move onto a player of the opposite team, not if they move onto a goal.

- **Output:**
  - The output format is correct, but the events should be printed in ascending order of time, which is not enforced in the current implementation.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but upon closer inspection, several issues exist in the movement and action handling logic. These issues could lead to incorrect behavior in certain scenarios. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
