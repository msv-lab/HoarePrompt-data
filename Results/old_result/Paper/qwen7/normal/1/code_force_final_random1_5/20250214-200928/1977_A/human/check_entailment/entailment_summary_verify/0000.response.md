### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary against the problem description and the provided test cases.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube.
   - The key point is that the number of cubes `m` must have the same parity (odd/even) as `n`.

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks specific conditions to determine if `m` can be achieved from `n` moves and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
   - The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

3. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It then checks several conditions:
     - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
     - If `m > n`, it prints "No".
     - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
     - If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
     - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The conditions provided in the program do not fully cover all scenarios, particularly the parity check.
   - The program incorrectly prints "Yes" when `m` and `n` have different parities, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

5. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program fails to check the parity condition.
   - For the test case:
     - Input:
       ```
       2
       4 3
       5 2
       ```
     - Expected Output:
       ```
       No
       No
       ```
     - Program Output:
       ```
       Yes
       Yes
       ```
   - The program incorrectly prints "Yes" for both cases because it does not check the parity condition.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the parity condition, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
