Postcondition: `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and if `i + 1 < n` and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is less than a certain character (either '<'), or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is less than a certain character (either '<'), then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
