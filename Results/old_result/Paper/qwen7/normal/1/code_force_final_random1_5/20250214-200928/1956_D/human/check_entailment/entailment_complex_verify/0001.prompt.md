You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

        #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one more than the final value of `r` (i.e., `r + 1`), since `i` starts at `l` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it exceeds `r`. The variable `l` remains unchanged at its initial value, and `r` also remains unchanged. All elements in the list `a` from index `l` to index `r` will be set to the value `r - l + 1`, as the loop updates these elements in each iteration.

If `a[l]` equals `r - l + 1`, no changes are made to `a`, `l`, `r`, or `ops`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of non-negative integers `a` by performing operations on its sublists defined by indices `l` and `r`. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation. Otherwise, it recursively ensures that all elements from `l` to `r` are set to `r - l + 1`, records the operation, and continues processing the sublist starting from `l + 1` to `r`.

Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is decremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters, `l` and `r`, which define a sublist within the list `a`. It aims to maximize the sum of the elements in this sublist by performing certain operations. If the sum of the elements in the sublist from index `l` to `r` is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements in this sublist to \(r - l + 1\). Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the sublist, updates the sublist to ensure the sum is maximized by recursively calling itself on the left and right parts of the sublist excluding the position of the maximum element, until the condition is met. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the list `a` in place and updates the `ops` list with the operations performed.

    #State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\), `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, and `ops` contains exactly three tuples `(l, r)`. The first tuple has `l` as the first element and `r` as the second element of the first tuple, the second tuple has `l` as the first element and `r` as the second element of the second tuple, and the third tuple has `l` as the first element and `r` as the second element of the third tuple.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `ops` will contain exactly three operations, each specified by a tuple `(l, r)`, and these tuples will be printed out by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a` and receives the sum `s` of all elements in `a`, the maximum value `m` in `a`, and a list of operations `ops`. It prints the sum `s` and the maximum value `m`. After that, it prints three specific operations specified by the tuples `(l, r)` contained in `ops`. The function does not return any value but modifies the output by printing the required information.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray `a[l...r]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - To maximize the sum, we should aim to make the subarray values as large as possible while ensuring the MEX is minimized.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function recursively sets the subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`.
   - It ensures that the subarray is filled with the smallest possible values that do not conflict with the rest of the array.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function to maximize the sum.
   - It returns the sum of the array and the number of operations performed.

5. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - This function attempts to maximize the sum by considering the current subarray.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\), it calls `func_1` to fill the subarray.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right parts of the subarray.

6. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly sets the subarray to the smallest possible values without conflicts.
  - However, it might not handle edge cases where the subarray already contains the required MEX value.

- **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
  - The logic to decide whether to fill the entire subarray or process parts of it seems correct.
  - However, the condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` might not always be optimal. For example, if the subarray has a mix of small and large values, this condition might not capture the best strategy.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function appears to call the recursive function and return the results correctly.

- **Function `func_3`**:
  - This function reads input and outputs the results correctly.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the functions, the primary concern is the correctness of the logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`. The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` might not always yield the optimal solution. However, the overall approach seems to be on the right track.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution is likely to work within the given limits but may not always produce the absolute optimal solution.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The program is likely to produce a good solution but may not always find the absolute maximum sum due to the heuristic used in `recursive_maximize_sum`.
