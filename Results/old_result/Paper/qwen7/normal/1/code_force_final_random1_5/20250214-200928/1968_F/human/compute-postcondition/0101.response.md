Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is increased by 4 * (n + 1), `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, `a` is fully populated with integers from `data[idx - 2]` up to `data[idx - 2 + n]`, `pf` is fully populated such that each element `pf[i]` is the result of the prefix XOR operation up to index `i` in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and the last element appended to `results` is an empty string; `q` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increases the value of `idx` by 2. Since `idx` was previously increased by `2 * (n + 1)`, the new increase is by 2, making the total increase `2 + 2 * (n + 1) = 4 * (n + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
