Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 7, `l` is int(data[idx]), `r` is int(data[idx + 1]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `results` remains unchanged, and `it2` is bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` using the `bisect.bisect_left` function on `v2` with the value `r` and then subtracts 1 from the result. This does not affect any of the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `it2` is now determined based on the position of `r` in the sorted list `v2`.
