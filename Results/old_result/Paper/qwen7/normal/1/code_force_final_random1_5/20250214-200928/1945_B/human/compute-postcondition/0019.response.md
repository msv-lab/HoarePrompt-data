Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(a, b) + m` to the variable `mn`. Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are obtained from the input split, their specific values are not known, but `mn` is calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. The other variables (`i` and `t`) remain unchanged.
