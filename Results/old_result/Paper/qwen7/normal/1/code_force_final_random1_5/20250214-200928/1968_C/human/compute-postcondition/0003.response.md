Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer using map and int functions, `a` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `x` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `a` and retains the initial states of `n` and `x`.
