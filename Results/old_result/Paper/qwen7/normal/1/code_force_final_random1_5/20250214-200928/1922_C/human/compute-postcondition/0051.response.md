Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer, and the current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`.

We need to determine what will be printed for the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]`.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the dictionary `d1`. Since no specific values for `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are given, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `d1[y] - d1[x]`.

Therefore, the output will be a reference to the expression itself, as we do not have the actual values of the dictionary entries.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
