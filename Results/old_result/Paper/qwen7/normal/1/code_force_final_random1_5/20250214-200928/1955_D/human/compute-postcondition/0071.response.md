Output State: **`i` is 1; `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is now decreased by 1; `ans` remains unchanged.**

The value of `curr` is decreased by 1, so the updated state of `curr` is now decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
