Output State: **`x` is now greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` is the list `[a], lst[a]` is now `[b]`**.

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `lst[a]`. Initially, `rev[b]` is the list `[a]`, which means `lst[a]` contains the element `b`. After executing the code, `lst[a]` will contain both elements, making it `[b]`. The values of `x`, `a`, `b`, and `rev[b]` remain unchanged except that `lst[a]` now includes `b`.
