Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing only one element which is 0.**

The code initializes `ad` as a list containing a single element, which is 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
