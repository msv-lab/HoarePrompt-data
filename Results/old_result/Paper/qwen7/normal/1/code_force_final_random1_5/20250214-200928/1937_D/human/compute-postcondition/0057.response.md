Postcondition: `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 3`, and `idx_B` is `[i]`. If `s[i] == '<'`, then `B` is a list containing 0 if `idx_B` was empty, otherwise `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Since there is no else part, the value of `B` remains unchanged if the condition `s[i] == '<'` is not met.
