Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is decremented by 1, `g` is `int(n / (count + 1))`, and if `g < countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
