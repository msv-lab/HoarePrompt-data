Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, i)` where `k` is updated based on the value of `i` (which is `n - 5`), and `i` is `n - 5` with `n` being an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)**.

This means that the program returns the result of the function `func_2` called with arguments `3`, `k`, and `i`. The value of `i` is determined by subtracting 5 from `n`, and `k` is updated based on the new value of `i`. The exact value of `k` depends on how it is updated, but the final result of `func_2(3, k, i)` is returned.
