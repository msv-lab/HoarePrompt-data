Postcondition: **`aOnes` is 1 if `i` is in both `a` and `b` and the number of ones in `a` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `aOnes` is 0. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 0 or 1, and either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`.**
