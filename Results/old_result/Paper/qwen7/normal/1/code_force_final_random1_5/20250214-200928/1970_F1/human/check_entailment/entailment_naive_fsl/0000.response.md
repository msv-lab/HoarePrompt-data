Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, which results in the opposing team scoring a point. According to the problem description, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the other team wins the point. However, the `func_1` function does not account for this case. Specifically, the function checks if the Quaffle is thrown into a goal using the `goalIn` function, but it does not update the points or print the appropriate message when the Quaffle is thrown into the player's own goal. Here is an example to demonstrate this issue:

### Example Input:
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

### Expected Output:
```
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

### Actual Output:
```
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

In this example, the red player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, but the program does not print the correct message or update the score accordingly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
