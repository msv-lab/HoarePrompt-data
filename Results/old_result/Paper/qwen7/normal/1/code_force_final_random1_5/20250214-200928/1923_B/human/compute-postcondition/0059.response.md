Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest` - `delta`, `delta` remains unchanged, `pos` is equal to `pos` + 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`.**

Explanation: The code `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `rest` is still equal to `rest` - `delta`, `delta` remains unchanged, `pos` is now one more than its original value, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`.
