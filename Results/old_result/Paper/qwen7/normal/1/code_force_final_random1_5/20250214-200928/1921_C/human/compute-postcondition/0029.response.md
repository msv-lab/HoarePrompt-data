Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `test_cases`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n` and `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = n + 1`.
   - `test_cases` remains unchanged because the number of test cases does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - The other variables (`feat`, `arr`, `array2`, `f`, `a`, `b`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition alone. Therefore, they remain the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `test_cases` remains the same (greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is `n + 1`, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) for every `i` in the range from 2 to `n`, and the condition \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a\) holds true for each of these elements, and the sum of `array2` plus \((n - len(array2)) * b\) is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f` depending on the condition inside the if else block.**
