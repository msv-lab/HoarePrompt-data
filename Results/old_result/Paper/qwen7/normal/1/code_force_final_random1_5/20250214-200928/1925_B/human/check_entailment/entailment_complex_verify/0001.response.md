### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.
   - The GCD of the difficulties should be maximized.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The given solution iterates over possible divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if splitting `x` into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `i` results in a valid configuration.
   - It also checks the complementary divisor `x // i` to ensure all conditions are met.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The solution correctly identifies potential divisors of `x` and checks if they can form valid sub-problems.
   - It ensures that the remaining difficulty after forming `n-1` sub-problems with the current divisor `i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the case where `x` is not perfectly divisible by `n` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.
   - It ensures the maximum GCD is found by comparing against the current best (`ans`).

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum GCD is sound.
   - The iteration up to `sqrt(x)` is efficient.
   - The checks for valid configurations are correctly implemented.

Upon closer inspection, the provided solution indeed appears to be correct. Here's a detailed breakdown of the verification:

- **Initialization:** The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
- **Iteration over Divisors:** The loop iterates over all divisors `i` of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`. This ensures that we consider all possible divisors efficiently.
- **Condition Checks:**
  - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
  - Similarly, it checks if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
- **Output:** The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the maximum GCD found for the given `x` and `n`.

The solution correctly handles edge cases and ensures that the maximum GCD is found. The logic is sound, and the implementation is efficient.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution is correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
