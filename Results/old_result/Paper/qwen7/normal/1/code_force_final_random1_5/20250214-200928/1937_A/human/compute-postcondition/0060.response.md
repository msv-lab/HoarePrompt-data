Given the initial state:
- `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `power` is equal to `n`.
- The if condition `power == n` is satisfied.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(2 ** power)`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. From the initial state, we know that `power` is equal to `n`.
2. The if condition `power == n` is satisfied, confirming that `power` indeed equals `n`.
3. Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** n`.

Since `n` is a variable, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `2 ** n`. However, we can describe it precisely as `2` raised to the power of `n`.

Output: **2 ** n**
