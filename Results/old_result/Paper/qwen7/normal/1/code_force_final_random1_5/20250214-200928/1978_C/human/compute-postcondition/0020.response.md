Output State: **The program returns the result of the function call `func_2(2, k, l)` where `k` is adjusted from its initial value as `k - (n - 1) + 1` and `l` is not defined, hence the function's postcondition remains unchanged.**

This means the program will return whatever `func_2(2, k, l)` evaluates to, with `k` being adjusted according to the given formula and `l` remaining undefined.
