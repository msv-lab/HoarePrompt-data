Output State: **`i` is `n + n`, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`, `impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment by 1 for each iteration, starting from `n+1`. Since the loop runs `n` times, `i` will become `n + n`. The list `gr` will contain `n` elements, each representing an input from the user because the loop appends one input per iteration. All other variables (`ans`, `impossible`, `j`, `m`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
