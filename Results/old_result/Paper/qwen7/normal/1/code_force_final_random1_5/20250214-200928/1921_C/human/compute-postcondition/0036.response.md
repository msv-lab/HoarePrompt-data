Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is now `feat[0]`, `f` is now `feat[1]`, `a` is now `feat[2]`, `b` is now `feat[-1]`, `arr` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `array2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The provided code initializes an empty list `array2`. This operation does not change the values of the existing variables (`feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except that `array2` is now an empty list.
