### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The problem involves determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- The program should output "Yes" if it's possible and "No" otherwise.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`.
- It checks specific conditions and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

#### Original Assessment Recap
- The original assessment correctly identified the key conditions needed to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- However, the assessment incorrectly included unnecessary conditions (4 and 5), which do not add any new valid scenarios.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Condition 1: `n == m`**
   - If `n == m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves by simply adding one cube per move.
   - **Correct**: Print "Yes".

2. **Condition 2: `m > n`**
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.
   - **Correct**: Print "No".

3. **Condition 3: `m == n - 1`**
   - If `m == n - 1`, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves by adding one cube per move except for the last move, where one cube is removed.
   - **Correct**: Print "Yes".

4. **Condition 4: `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`**
   - This condition is unnecessary because if both `m` and `n` are even, they can always match (e.g., adding and removing pairs of cubes).
   - **Redundant**: This condition does not add any new valid scenarios.

5. **Condition 5: `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`**
   - This condition is also unnecessary because if both `m` and `n` are odd, they can always match (e.g., adding and removing pairs of cubes, plus one extra move).
   - **Redundant**: This condition does not add any new valid scenarios.

6. **Default Condition:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".
   - **Correct**: Print "No".

#### Simplified Correct Conditions
- **Condition 1:** `n == m` → Yes
- **Condition 2:** `m > n` → No
- **Condition 3:** `m == n - 1` → Yes

These conditions cover all necessary scenarios without redundancy.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles all the necessary conditions without including redundant conditions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
