Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` aims to decode the string `s` by reversing the encoding process.
2. It first creates a list of unique characters from the input string `s` and sorts them alphabetically.
3. Then it iterates through each character in the input string `s` and replaces it with the corresponding character from the sorted list of unique characters.
4. However, there are a few issues with the logic in the function:
   - The function incorrectly modifies the input string `s` in place using `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])`. This operation can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results because it changes the string while iterating over it.
   - The function attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars` when an unknown character is encountered, but it does not handle the case where the character should be mapped to the first or last element of `unique_chars`.
   - The function returns a string composed of all unique characters from the final state of `s` in the order they appeared, which is not what is intended for decoding.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
