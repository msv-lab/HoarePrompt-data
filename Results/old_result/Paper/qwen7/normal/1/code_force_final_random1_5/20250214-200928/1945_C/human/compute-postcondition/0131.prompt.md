Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pk` remains unchanged, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, if the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end, otherwise `final` contains an additional element `n` appended to it, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing all characters of the input string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and if `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`, then `lst` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `zero_perc` is either 0, 100, or 50, `one` is 2, and `one_perc` is -200 * (o - 2) // (n - 1). If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `i` is set to 2. In all cases, the values of `n`, `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged as specified in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `one` is 3, `one_perc` is -200, `zero_perc` is 0, and `lst` is [4]. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then the list `lst` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
