Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list a of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and a series of pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. For each pair, the function checks if the elements at positions x_i and y_i in list a are equal and returns a boolean value indicating the result.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list. It then checks specified pairs within the list and returns whether the elements at those positions are equal.
