Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is an empty list, and final is sorted; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.**

Explanation: The code `c1 = o * 100 // n` calculates the value of `c1` based on the values of `o` and `n`. However, since the initial state does not specify the values of `o` and `n`, `c1` is simply the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`. The other variables (`lst`, `mini`, and `final`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
