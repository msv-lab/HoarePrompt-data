Output State: **`nx` is the string 'xx[i][j - 1]', `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after appending `xx[i][j - 1]`, `nx` becomes the string `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
