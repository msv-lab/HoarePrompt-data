Postcondition: `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 1. If either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, no change to the value of `impossible`.
