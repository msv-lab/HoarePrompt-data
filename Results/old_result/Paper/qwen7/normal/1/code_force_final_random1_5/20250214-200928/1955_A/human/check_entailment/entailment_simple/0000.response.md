Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks whether it is cheaper to buy yogurts at the regular price (`a`) or the promotion price (`b`):
   - If the promotion price for two yogurts (`b * 2`) is less than the regular price for two yogurts (`a * 2`), it means it's cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price.
   - If `n` is even, it calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b` because you can buy `n / 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
   - If `n` is odd, it buys `(n // 2)` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price, resulting in `(n // 2) * b + a`.

4. The program handles all possible scenarios correctly:
   - If the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than the regular price for two, it always uses the promotion.
   - If `n` is even, it divides `n` by 2 and multiplies by `b`.
   - If `n` is odd, it divides `n` by 2 and rounds down, then adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the logic required to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
