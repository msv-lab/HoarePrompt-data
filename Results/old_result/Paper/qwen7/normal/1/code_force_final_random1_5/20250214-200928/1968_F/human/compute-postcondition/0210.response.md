Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `idx` is increased by 2 (this is not directly relevant to the loop)
   - `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`
   - `pf[2]` is either not in `mp` or `mp[pf[2]]` is an empty list
   - `mp[pf[3]].append(3)`
   - `a[4]` is an integer from `data[idx]`
   - `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`
   - `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` is executed for `i` being 3 (this is not directly relevant to the loop)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 5, `n` must be greater than 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 5
- `n` must be greater than 5

The final answer is:
State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5**
