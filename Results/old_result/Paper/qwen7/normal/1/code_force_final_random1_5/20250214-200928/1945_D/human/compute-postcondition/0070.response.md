Output State: **`na_frente` is the input integer minus 2, `total` contains the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. Since `pos_final` was initially an input integer, after decrementing, it becomes an input integer minus 1. All other variables (`na_frente`, `total`, `c`, `v`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
