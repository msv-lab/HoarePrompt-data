Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `idx` is increased by 2 as per the initial state condition.
