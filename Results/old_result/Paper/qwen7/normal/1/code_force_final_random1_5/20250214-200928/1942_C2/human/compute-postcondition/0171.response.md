Output State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is `i` // 2, `y` is `-1 - (i // 2)`, `sx` is `-2 + i**.

Explanation: The code updates `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Given that `y` is `-1 - (i // 2)`, `y * 2` becomes `-2 - (i // 1)`, which simplifies to `-2 - i`. Therefore, `sx` becomes `-4 + i + (-2 - i)`, which simplifies to `-2 + i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
