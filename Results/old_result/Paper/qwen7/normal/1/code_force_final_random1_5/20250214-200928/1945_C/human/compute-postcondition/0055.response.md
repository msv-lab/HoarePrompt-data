Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `lst`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `lst`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - `i` is equal to `n-2`.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 4.
   - `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3.
   - `one` is either 2, 3, or 4.
   - `zero_perc` is 100.
   - `one_perc` is -100.
   - `lst` must contain at least two elements.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `ele` in `lst`, the next element `ele` will be the next item in the list `lst`.
   - The list `lst` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `lst` must have at least one more element, and `ele` will be the next element in the list.

**State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, zero is either 1, 2, or 3, one is either 2, 3, or 4, zero_perc is 100, one_perc is -100, and `lst` must contain at least one more element**.
