Output State: **nx is a string of length n-1, i is n+1, n is at least 4, and j is n+1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `nx` will be a string of length `n-1` constructed based on the conditions within the loop. The variable `i` remains `n + 1` because it is incremented inside the loop but never changed outside. The variable `n` remains at least 4 as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `j` starts at 3 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`, so after the loop completes, `j` will be `n + 1`.
