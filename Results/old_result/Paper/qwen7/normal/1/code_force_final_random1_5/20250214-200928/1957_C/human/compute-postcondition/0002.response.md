Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 3 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to 3. This means that before the loop begins, `i` must be 3.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `i` starts at 3, the loop will execute as long as `3 ≤ n + 1`, which simplifies to `n ≥ 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `i` is 3 and that `n` is at least 2. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as given.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 3.
- `n` should be at least 2.

So, the final state is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `i` is 3**
