Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2 * (n + 1), `n` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is filled with the integer value from `data[idx - 2 + i]` for `i` in range(0, n + 1), `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in range(1, n + 1), `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[0]` is `[0]` and for each `pf[i]` in the range of 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing all the indices `i` for which `pf[i]` was calculated.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will be increased by twice the value of `n + 1` (since `idx` is incremented by 2 in each iteration and there are `n + 1` iterations), the lists `a` and `pf` will be fully populated based on the data provided, and the dictionary `mp` will map each unique prefix XOR value (`pf[i]`) to a list of indices where that value was encountered.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted into `v2` to keep the list sorted; `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 4; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` contains 'YES' appended to it; otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect.bisect_left).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is updated to the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, then `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
