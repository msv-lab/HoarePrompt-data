Output State: **`cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is the entire string `s` concatenated in some order based on the conditions provided, and `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution, with the additional condition that `cnt` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `tmp` as an empty string. None of the other variables (`cur`, `ans`, `cnt`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
