Output State: **`line` is a string, `ind` is an index within the string `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is not `i, ind`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, and the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0**.

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B'. Since the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G', the condition `line[ind][0] == 'B'` is false. Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
