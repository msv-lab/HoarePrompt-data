Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `comand` is equal to the list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `team` is 1 if the first element of the `command` list starts with 'B', else `team` is 0; points[team] is 10 more than its previous value.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Since `team` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition given, `points[team]` will be increased by 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
