Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` is the string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the string input by the user to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
