Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value found during the loop execution.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the maximum value among the following conditions:
1. The initial value of `ans`, which is 1.
2. The value of `x // i` when both `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` are true.
3. The integer part of the square root of `x` + 1 if the conditions in the second if statement are met.

The loop iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` from 1 up to and including the integer part of the square root of `x`. For each divisor, it checks if certain conditions are satisfied and updates `ans` accordingly. After completing all iterations, `ans` will contain the highest value that satisfies any of these conditions.
