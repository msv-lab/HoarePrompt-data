Postcondition: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and the difference between `s` and `(b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is not greater than 1 or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.**
