Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple inputs: a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case includes two positive integers `n` and `m` (with 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n` containing positive integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific parameters and lists, and for each test case, it performs some operation based on the provided inputs without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
