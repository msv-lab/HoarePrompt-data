The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, two integers n and k, and an array of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `sm` based on the array and the given parameters. If `sm` is less than 0, it sets `sm` to 9999999995; otherwise, it takes `sm` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Finally, it prints the resulting value of `sm` for each test case.
