Output State: **`i` is 3; `dp` is `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1 or not (arr[3] - arr[4] > 1)`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3 and `dp` is `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1 or not dp`. After executing the code snippet `dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, the value of `dp` is updated to `arr[3] - arr[5] > 1 or not (arr[3] - arr[4] > 1)`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
