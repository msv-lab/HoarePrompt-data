Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `p` is [0], `c` is [0], `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code initializes `i` and `j` to 0. This resets the values of `i` (which was previously the total sum of all elements in `l`) and `j` (which was previously the count of 1's in `l`). The values of `p`, `c`, `l`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
