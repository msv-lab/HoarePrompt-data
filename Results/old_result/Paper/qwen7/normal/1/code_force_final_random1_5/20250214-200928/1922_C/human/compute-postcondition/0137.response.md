Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, `j` is `m + 1`, `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged from their initial states, `n` is an integer greater than `m + 1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The initial values of `m`, `x`, `y`, `j`, `d1`, `d2`, and `n` remain unchanged.
