Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

2. **Check each variable involved in the loop condition**:
   - `rest`: The loop will continue as long as `rest` is not equal to 0.
   - `pos`: The loop will continue as long as `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `rest` must not be 0.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `pos` must not be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.

4. **Consider the given state**:
   - `distance` is increased by 1 (this does not affect the loop condition).
   - `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` (this means `pos` is within the bounds of `sorted_indices`).
   - `rest` is `k` (this means `rest` is some non-zero value).

Given these points, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `rest` is not 0. Since `rest` is initially `k` (a non-zero value), no adjustment is needed for `rest`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains the same, and no additional adjustments are required.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`distance` is increased by 1, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `rest` is `k`**
