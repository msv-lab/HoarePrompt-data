Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 2 (if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `curr` remains as it was), `ans` is 2 depending on whether the condition `curr >= k` is met, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was either 1 or 2 before this operation, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
