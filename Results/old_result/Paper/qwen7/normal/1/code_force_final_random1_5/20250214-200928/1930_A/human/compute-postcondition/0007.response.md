Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 2 each time (due to `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`), at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been an even number less than `2 * n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 (from the previous even number to the next even number).
   - Therefore, `i` will become the next even number, which is `i + 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `score` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified in the loop head.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` is the next even number (i.e., `i + 2`), `n` must be greater than 0**.
