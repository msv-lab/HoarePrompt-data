Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `results` is a list containing `t-1` elements, and each of these elements is the value of `winner`.
- `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer.
- `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer.
- `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list.

Given this information, since `results` contains `t-1` elements, the next element in the list after these `t-1` elements would be the `t`th element. However, the problem does not specify the value of the `t`th element in the `results` list. Therefore, we can only describe it in terms of its position.

Output: **the t-th element in the results list**
