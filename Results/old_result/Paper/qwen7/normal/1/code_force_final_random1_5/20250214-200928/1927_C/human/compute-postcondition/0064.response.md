Based on the initial state provided:

- `aOnes` is the number of elements in list `a` that are also in list `b` and do not exceed `newk` in count.
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces.
- `i` is equal to `k + 1`.

The condition `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk` is also satisfied.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
