Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `A[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `a = A[l]` assigns the value at index `l` of the list `A` to the variable `a`. The other variables `i`, `r`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
