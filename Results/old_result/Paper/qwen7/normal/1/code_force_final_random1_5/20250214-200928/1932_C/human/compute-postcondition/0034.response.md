Output State: **`p` is `p * v % m`, `ans` contains the value of `p`, `b` must contain at least one element**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. Since `p` is initially defined as `p * v % m`, its value remains unchanged within the context of this single operation. The list `ans` now includes the current value of `p`, and the condition that `b` must contain at least one element is preserved.
