Output State: **`i` is 0, `mex` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`, each element in `res` is set to `mex - ar[0]`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is initialized to `None`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `res` of length `n` with `None` values. This does not change the values of `i`, `mex`, `n`, or `ar`. The values of `i` and `mex` remain as they were in the initial state, `n` remains an input integer, and `ar` remains a list of integers entered by the user. The list `res` is now created and initialized to `None` for each index from 0 to `n-1`.
