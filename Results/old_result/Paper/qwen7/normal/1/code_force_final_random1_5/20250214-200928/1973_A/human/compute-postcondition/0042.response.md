The code appends `-1` to the list `resultats`. Since `resultats` was initially a list containing `-1`, after appending another `-1`, the list will contain two `-1`s. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1`.

Output State: **`p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1`.**
