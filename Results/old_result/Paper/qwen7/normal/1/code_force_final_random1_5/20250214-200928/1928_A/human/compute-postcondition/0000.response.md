Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is the loop variable initialized to 0 when the loop starts (since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to \(t-1\)).
   - The expression `int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which should be equal to `t`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute, the value read from `input()` must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, the value of `t` must be read correctly as an integer.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- The value of `t` must be read correctly as an integer.
- The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `i` is 0**.
