Postcondition: **`processing[di - 1]` is set to 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `di` is updated to the next element in `d[da]`.**

This means that regardless of whether the condition `processing[di - 1] == 0` is true or false, the final state of the program will have `processing[di - 1]` set to 0, `tmp` updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `di` updated to the next element in `d[da]`.
