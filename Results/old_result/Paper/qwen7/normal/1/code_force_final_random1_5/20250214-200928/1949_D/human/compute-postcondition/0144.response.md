Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `sa` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) to the list `sa`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, appending this value to `sa` means `sa` now contains this specific value. The value of `i` remains unchanged from its initial state of `i + 1`.
