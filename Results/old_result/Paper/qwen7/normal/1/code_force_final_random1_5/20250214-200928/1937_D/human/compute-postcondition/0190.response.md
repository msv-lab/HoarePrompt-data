Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`, and these conditions hold true whether the condition `l - r - 1 > 0` is satisfied or not.
