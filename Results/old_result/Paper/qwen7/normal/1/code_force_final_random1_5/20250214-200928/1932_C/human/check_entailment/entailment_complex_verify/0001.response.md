### Reasoning

The original assessment identified a logical error in the product calculation and order of results. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly appends the product to the list `ans` after processing all commands instead of calculating the product for each command and appending it to `ans` in the correct order.

Let's re-evaluate the annotated code and the corrected implementation step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results.
   - Uses two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the left and right ends of the array `a`.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the corresponding element from `a` to `b` and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
   - After processing all commands, it initializes `p` to 1 and iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` and appends the result to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed `ans`.

The key issue is that the function should calculate the product of the remaining elements before appending the result to `ans` for each command, not after processing all commands. This means the function should not reverse `b` and should directly append the results in the correct order.

### Corrected Implementation

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in b:
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

### Verification

1. **Command Processing:**
   - The function correctly processes the commands 'L' and 'R' by appending the appropriate elements to `b` and adjusting the pointers `l` and `r`.

2. **Product Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` for each command and appends the result to `ans` in the correct order.

3. **Reversing the Order:**
   - The function does not need to reverse the order of `b` because it directly appends the results in the correct order.

### Conclusion

The corrected implementation ensures that the product is calculated correctly and the results are appended in the correct order, matching the problem description.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
