Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 3 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to 3. This means that before the loop starts, `i` must be 3.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` (which is 3) must satisfy this condition. This implies that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `k`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or the initialization of `i`. Hence, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be 3.
- `n` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
