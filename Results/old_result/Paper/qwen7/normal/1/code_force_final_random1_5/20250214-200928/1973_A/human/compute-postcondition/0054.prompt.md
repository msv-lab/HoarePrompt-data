You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and cas_de_test is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The `resultats` list will contain the final results for all the tuples in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`, the loop will compute `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs = total_points // 2`, and `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Depending on the conditions, `resultats` will append either `-1` or `egalites // 2` to itself. After all iterations, `resultats` will be a list containing the results for each tuple in `cas_de_test`, with `-1` appended if any condition fails, otherwise `egalites // 2`.
    #
    #The `total_matchs` and `egalites` variables will be recalculated for each tuple, but their specific values are not preserved outside the loop as they are used only within the loop body. The `total_points` variable will also be recalculated for each tuple but similarly does not persist outside the loop.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list named `resultats` which contains the results for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, the program calculates `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs = total_points // 2`, and `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Depending on certain conditions, the list `resultats` appends either `-1` or `egalites // 2` to itself. If any condition fails during the iteration, `-1` is appended; otherwise, `egalites // 2` is appended.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p1, p2, and p3 such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30. The function returns a list named `resultats` which, for each tuple (p1, p2, p3) in `cas_de_test`, calculates `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs = total_points // 2`, and `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Depending on certain conditions, the list `resultats` appends either `-1` or `egalites // 2` to itself. If any condition fails during the iteration, `-1` is appended; otherwise, `egalites // 2` is appended.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named `resultats` which contains the results for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, the program calculates `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs = total_points // 2`, and `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Depending on certain conditions, the list `resultats` appends either `-1` or `egalites // 2` to itself. If any condition fails during the iteration, `-1` is appended; otherwise, `egalites // 2` is appended.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
