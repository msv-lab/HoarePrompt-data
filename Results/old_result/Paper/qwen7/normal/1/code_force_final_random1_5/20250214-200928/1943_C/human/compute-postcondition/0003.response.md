Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is an integer from the input, `v` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is not affected by this code. Therefore, `n` remains unchanged, and the new variables `u` and `v` are assigned the integer values from the input.
