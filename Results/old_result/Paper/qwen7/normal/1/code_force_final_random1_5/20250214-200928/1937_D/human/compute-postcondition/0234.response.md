Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`
- `r` is `r - 1`
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `l` remains the same
- `a` and `b` retain their original values

We need to evaluate the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

However, there are a few key pieces missing:
- The value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not specified.
- The value of `i` after it is incremented is not explicitly given.

Let's assume `i` was originally `i0` before the increment. After the increment, `i` becomes `i0 + 1`.

So the expression becomes:
\[ n - (i0 + 1) + ((i0 + 1) - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 \]

Simplifying this:
\[ n - i0 - 1 + i0 + 1 - 2 \cdot idx_A[l - 1] \]
\[ n - 2 \cdot idx_A[l - 1] \]

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]**
