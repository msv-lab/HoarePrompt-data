Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program hardcodes the number of test cases (`t = 7`) and the test cases themselves (`cas_de_test`). However, the problem statement specifies that `t` should be read from input, not hardcoded.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Draws**: The logic used to calculate the number of draws is flawed. Specifically, the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` does not accurately represent the number of draws. The correct approach involves checking if the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the results directly without reading the test cases from input as required by the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    cas_de_test = []
    for _ in range(t):
        p1 = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p2 = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p3 = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        cas_de_test.append((p1, p2, p3))

    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matches = total_points // 2
        if total_matches > 3 or p3 > total_matches:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        max_draws = (total_points - 2 * p3 + 2) // 2
        if max_draws < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)

    for res in resultats:
        print(res)

func_1()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases and the scores from standard input, processes each test case according to the problem's requirements, and outputs the results accordingly.
