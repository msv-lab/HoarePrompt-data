Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the elements of the list `lst`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `ele` (the element being iterated) and `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `lst` is given as `[3, 4, ..., n-1]`. This means `lst` is a list starting from 3 up to `n-1`.
   - `ele` will take on each value from this list during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. Since `lst` starts from 3 and goes up to `n-1`, and `n` is an integer greater than 4, `lst` will always contain at least one element (which is 3).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `lst` will always contain at least one element, no adjustment is needed for `lst`.
   - The variable `ele` will take on the values from `lst` during each iteration, but its initial state is not specified. We only need to ensure that `lst` contains at least one element.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `lst` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is equal to n-2, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, zero is either 1, 2, or 3, one is either 2, 3, or 4, zero_perc is 100, one_perc is -100, and lst must contain at least one element**.
