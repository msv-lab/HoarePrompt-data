### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of different final configurations of an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves.
   - The moves are mirrored by the computer, and no two rooks can attack each other (same row or column).
   - The final configurations should consider the positions of rooks and their colors.

2. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to store intermediate results.
   - The `dp` array is initialized to -1.
   - The `func_1` function populates the `dp` array using a specific recurrence relation.
   - The main loop reads the input and calculates the number of valid configurations based on the size of the board and the number of moves already made.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - The `dp` array is initialized with -1, indicating uncomputed values.
   - The `func_1` function sets base cases for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.
   - For larger values of `i`, the recurrence relation is used:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]

4. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program reads \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It then reads \(k\) pairs of coordinates, adding them to a set `invalid` to keep track of occupied rows and columns.
   - The final number of configurations is calculated as `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`.

5. **Recurrence Relation Explanation:**
   - The recurrence relation seems to count the number of ways to place rooks on an \(i \times i\) board without attacking each other.
   - The term `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` accounts for placing a rook in a new row or column while ensuring no attacks.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The base cases handle small boards (1x1 and 2x2).
   - The `max(1, ...)` ensures that even if no valid configurations remain, the result is at least 1.

### Verification:

- **Base Cases:**
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct. For a 1x1 board, there is only 1 way to place a rook (no rook). For a 2x2 board, there are 3 ways to place 2 non-attacking rooks (one on each diagonal).

- **Recurrence Relation:**
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is designed to count the number of ways to place rooks on an \(i \times i\) board. This relation correctly accounts for placing a rook in a new row or column while ensuring no attacks.

- **Main Logic:**
  - The main logic correctly initializes the `dp` array, populates it using the recurrence relation, and then calculates the number of valid configurations based on the size of the board and the number of moves already made.

- **Handling Invalid Moves:**
  - The set `invalid` keeps track of the rows and columns that are already occupied. The final number of configurations is calculated as `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`, which correctly accounts for the remaining valid positions.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The dynamic programming approach and the recurrence relation are sound, and the main logic handles the input and output correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
