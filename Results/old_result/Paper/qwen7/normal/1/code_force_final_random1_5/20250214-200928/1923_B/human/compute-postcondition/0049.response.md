Output State: **`rest` is reduced by `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` to the variable `delta`. This reduces the value of `rest` by the same amount. The value of `pos` remains unchanged, but it is noted that `pos` must still be less than `len(sorted_indices)` as this condition was part of the initial state and no code has altered it.
