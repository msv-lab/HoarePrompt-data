Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ss`, and if `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` is equal to `cur`, then `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` and then 1 is added, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one less character, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either `ss` or `ss` + `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97, and the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is either satisfied or not satisfied depending on the execution path taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least two less characters, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97, and `cur_ss` is updated to be `ord(ss) - ord('a')




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
