t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of multiple lines as described in the problem statement. Each line within a test case contains two integers separated by space, where the first integer a represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and the second integer x represents the value associated with the constraint (1 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 10^9).
