The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is an integer, and `b`, which is a list of integers. The length of `b` is either equal to the number of prefix maximums (`m_1`) or the number of suffix maximums (`m_2`), and each element in `b` is an index within the range [1, n]. After executing the function body, the function returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` modulo 1000000007.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. It returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` modulo 1000000007.**
