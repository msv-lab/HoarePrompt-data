Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `power` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `power` and `n`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `power` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `power` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `power` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.
   - Other variables (`n_cases` and `i`) do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `power` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
