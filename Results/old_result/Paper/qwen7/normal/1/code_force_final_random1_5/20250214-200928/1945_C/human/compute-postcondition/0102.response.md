Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'. After executing `zero += 1`, the value of `zero` becomes 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
