Output State: **`total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, and the value of `total_points` is odd; `resultats` contains `-1`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `total_points` and `resultats` remain unchanged.
