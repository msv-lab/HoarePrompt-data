You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the integer returned from `func_7()` and equals 1, `l` is the length of `b`, and `n` is not equal to 2
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `l`; `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 3; `ans` is [4, 8, 16, ..., 2 ** l]
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = l-1`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `i` reached 4, meaning `l` must be at least 5 (since the loop starts at 2 and increments by 1 each time). Therefore, `i` will eventually equal `l`, and `ans` will contain all values from `2^2` to `2^l` in steps of 2.
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `lk` must be greater than 3; `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`.
        #
        #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `lk - 2`, meaning the loop has completed `lk - 2` iterations. The variable `lk` must be greater than 3 for the loop to run at least three times. The list `ans` will contain a sequence of powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\).
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is `lk - 1`, `ans` contains `[2, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk]`.
        #
        #To understand this, let's break it down:
        #
        #1. **Initial State**: 
        #   - `i` starts as `lk - 2`.
        #   - `lk` is greater than 3.
        #   - `ans` is initially `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, (k - 1 - sum(ans))]`.
        #
        #2. **Loop Execution**:
        #   - The loop runs from `i = lk - 2` to `i = lk - 1` (inclusive).
        #   - In each iteration, `ans.append(2 ** i)` is executed.
        #
        #3. **After First Iteration**:
        #   - `i` becomes `lk - 1`.
        #   - `ans` becomes `[2]`.
        #
        #4. **After Second Iteration**:
        #   - `i` becomes `lk`.
        #   - `ans` becomes `[2, 2]`.
        #
        #5. **After Third Iteration**:
        #   - `i` becomes `lk + 1` (but since the loop condition stops at `i < l`, it effectively stops at `i = lk`).
        #   - `ans` becomes `[2, 2, 4]`.
        #
        #6. **Final State After All Iterations**:
        #   - `i` will be `lk - 1` because the loop condition `i < l` will stop the loop just before `i` reaches `l`.
        #   - `ans` will contain all the powers of 2 from `2^(lk-2)` to `2^lk` plus the initial elements `[k + 1, 2 * k + 1, (k - 1 - sum(ans))]`.
        #
        #So, the final state of `ans` will include all the powers of 2 from `2^(lk-2)` to `2^lk` followed by the initial elements `[k + 1, 2 * k + 1, (k - 1 - sum(ans))]` and then `2^lk`.
    #State: `i` is `l` if `k` is 1, otherwise `i` is `lk - 1`. `ans` contains all the powers of 2 from `2^(l-2)` to `2^l` followed by the initial elements `[k + 1, 2 * k + 1, (k - 1 - sum(ans))]` and then `2^l` if `k` is not 1.
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string containing space-separated integers. These integers include all the powers of 2 from \(2^{l-2}\) to \(2^l\), followed by the initial elements \([k + 1, 2 * k + 1, (k - 1 - \text{sum}(ans))]\), and then \(2^l\) if \(k\) is not 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either '1\n2' or a string containing space-separated integers. The returned string includes all the powers of 2 from \(2^{l-2}\) to \(2^l\), followed by the initial elements \([k + 1, 2 * k + 1, (k - 1 - \text{sum}(ans))]\), and then \(2^l\) if \(k\) is not 1. If the conditions do not match, it returns '1\n2'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns a string containing space-separated integers. These integers include all the powers of 2 from \(2^{l-2}\) to \(2^l\), followed by the initial elements \([k + 1, 2 * k + 1, (k - 1 - \text{sum}(ans))]\), and then \(2^l\) if \(k\) is not 1.
