Reasoning:
The annotated program does not accurately reflect the logic needed to solve the problem correctly. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Word:**
   - The logic in the program attempts to construct words based on the value of `n` relative to 52, 26, and 3. However, this approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for every possible `n` in the range [3, 78].
   - For example, if `n` is 24, the current logic constructs "aav", which is correct. But if `n` is 25, the logic constructs "aba", which is not the lexicographically smallest word ("aab" should be constructed instead).

2. **Improper Handling of Different Ranges:**
   - The ranges used to construct the word are not correctly aligned with the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the ranges should be:
     - If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word should start with "aa".
     - If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), the word should start with "ab".
     - If `n` is between 53 and 78 (inclusive), the word should start with "ac".

3. **Constructing the Word Correctly:**
   - To ensure the lexicographically smallest word, we need to calculate how many full "aa"s, "ab"s, or "ac"s fit into `n` and then handle the remainder appropriately.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
