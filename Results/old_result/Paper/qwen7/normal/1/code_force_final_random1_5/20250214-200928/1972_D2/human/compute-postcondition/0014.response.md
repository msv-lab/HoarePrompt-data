Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 6; `y` is increased by 1; `cnt` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. The conditions related to `math.gcd(x, y)`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these variables or their relationships. Therefore, `cnt` remains unchanged as per the initial postcondition.
