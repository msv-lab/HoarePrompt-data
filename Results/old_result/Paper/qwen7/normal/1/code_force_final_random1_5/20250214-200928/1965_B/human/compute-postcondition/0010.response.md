Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `l` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `l-1`.

3. **Initial values of the variables**:
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k` is the integer returned from `func_7()` and equals 1.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.
   - `ans` is `[2, 3]`.
   - `n` is not equal to 2.

4. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 2`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 2.

5. **Determine the value of `l`**: The variable `l` is the length of `b`, which is the binary representation of `n`. Since `n` is not equal to 2, `b` will have at least one bit set to 1 (as `n` is a positive integer other than 2).

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start executing. Specifically, `i` should be set to 2, and `l` should be the length of the binary representation of `n`.

State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3], and `n` is not equal to 2.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `l`:

State: **`i` is 2, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 2**.
