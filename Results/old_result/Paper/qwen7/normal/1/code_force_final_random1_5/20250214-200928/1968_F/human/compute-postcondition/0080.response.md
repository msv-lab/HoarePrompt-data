Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search, `l` is updated to the integer value from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to the integer value from `data[idx]`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions. The value of `idx` is increased by 4, and the logic for appending 'YES' or 'NO' to `results` and updating `v1` and `v2` remains unchanged.
