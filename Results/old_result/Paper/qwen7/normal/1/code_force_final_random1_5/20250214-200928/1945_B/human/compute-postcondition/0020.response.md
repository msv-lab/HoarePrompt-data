Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`.

We need to determine the value of `mn // a + mn // b + 1` and print it.

Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. `mn = min(a, b) + m`
   - Here, `mn` is the sum of the minimum of `a` and `b` with `m`.

2. `mn // a + mn // b + 1`
   - This expression involves integer division (`//`), which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
   - We need to evaluate `mn // a` and `mn // b` separately.

To proceed further, we need the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `m`. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only express the final output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b + 1**
