Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is \(n - 9\), `k` is \(n - 10\), the first element of list `l` is equal to the second last element of list `l`, the second last element of list `l` is the same as the first element, the last element of list `l` is removed.**

Explanation: The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`) remain unchanged. The first and second last elements of the list `l` are still equal, as no other elements were modified.
