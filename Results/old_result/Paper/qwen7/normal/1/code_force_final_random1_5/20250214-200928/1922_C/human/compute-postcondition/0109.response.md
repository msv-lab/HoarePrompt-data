Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n-3`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- The length of list `l` is at least `n-1`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates from `n-2` down to `1` (exclusive).
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-3`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
- Therefore, `i` will be `n-4` in the next iteration.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0.
- Since `i` is currently `n-3`, the next value of `i` will be `n-4`, which is still greater than 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`i`**: It will be `n-4`.
- **`n`**: No change needed since it is a condition for the loop but not a variable being modified in the loop itself.
- **List `l`**: No change needed since its length is a condition but not a variable being modified in the loop itself.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n-4`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, the length of list `l` is at least `n-1`**
