The only variable in the loop head is `lst[tmp]`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst[tmp]`. If `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst[tmp]` is now an empty list. For the loop to be executed one more time, `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list.

State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is now the last element of `lst[lst[tmp].pop()]`, `x` is 0, `one` is True, and `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list**
