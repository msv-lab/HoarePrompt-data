Output State: **`x` is an array, `j` is `j + 1`, `a[i]` is incremented by 1, `a[j]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. The initial state mentions that `a[i]` is incremented by 1, which means `a[i]` was already incremented before this line of code. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` remains an array, `j` is `j + 1`, `a[i]` is incremented by 1 (as mentioned in the initial state), and now `a[j]` is also incremented by 1.
