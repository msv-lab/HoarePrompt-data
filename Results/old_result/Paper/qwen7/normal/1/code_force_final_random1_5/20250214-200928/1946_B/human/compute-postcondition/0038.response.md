Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - `n` is given as `t`, which is initially greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments, it will always be valid as long as `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - The value of `n` should be set to the initial value of `t`, which is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 0, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is -111**
