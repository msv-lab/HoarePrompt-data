Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - r - 3] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` from the current value of `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.
