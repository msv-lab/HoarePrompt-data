Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `array2` contains elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is satisfied.
- The sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'No'. Since there are no variables or objects whose values need to be substituted, the output is straightforward.

Output: **No**
