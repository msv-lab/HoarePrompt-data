Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`. This matches the problem description.

2. **Suffix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the suffix sums (`suf`) and the minimum prefix sums (`smin`). These calculations are crucial for determining the maximum possible sum after performing the operations. The suffix sum array `suf` is built correctly, and the `smin` array is also constructed properly to store the minimum prefix sum up to each index.

3. **Maximum Possible Sum Calculation**: The program computes the maximum possible sum after `k` operations using the formula `2 ** k * (suf[i] - smin[i]) - (suf[i] - smin[i]) + suf[n]`. This formula is derived from the problem's constraints and logic, which involves maximizing the sum by strategically inserting the sum of subarrays.

4. **Adjustment for Negative Values**: The program correctly handles negative values of `sm` by adjusting them to 9999999995. This ensures that the result is always non-negative and within the required modulo range.

5. **Modulo Operation**: Finally, the program takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the output is within the specified range.

Given the annotations and the code logic, the program appears to follow the problem requirements accurately and produces the expected results based on the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
