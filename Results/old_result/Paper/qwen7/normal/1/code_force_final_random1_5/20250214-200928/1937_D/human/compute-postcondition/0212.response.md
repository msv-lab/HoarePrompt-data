Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` from its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
