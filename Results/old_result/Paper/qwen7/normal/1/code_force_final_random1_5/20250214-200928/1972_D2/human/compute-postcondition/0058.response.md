Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\).

2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - \(n\) must be less than 15.
   - \(m\) must be less than 10.
   - \(cnt\) has been incremented by the minimum value between \(\frac{n}{((x + y) * x)}\) and \(\frac{m}{((x + y) * y)}\).
   - \(y\) has been increased by 1.

3. **Check the loop condition after the previous iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) must hold true.
   - Since \(y\) has been increased by 1, the new value of \(y\) is \(y + 1\).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The loop can continue if \((x + (y + 1)) * (y + 1) \leq n\) and \((x + (y + 1)) * (y + 1) \leq m\).
   - To ensure these conditions hold, we need to adjust \(n\) and \(m\) such that they are still valid for the next iteration.

Given that \(n\) and \(m\) were already less than their respective thresholds before the increment of \(y\), we need to ensure that the new values of \(n\) and \(m\) still satisfy the conditions when \(y\) is incremented.

Since the exact values of \(x\) and \(y\) are not provided, we cannot determine specific numerical adjustments. However, we can ensure that the conditions are met by keeping \(n\) and \(m\) within their bounds.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are \(n\) and \(m\) to ensure they remain valid for the next iteration.

**State:**
- \(n\) must be less than 15.
- \(m\) must be less than 10.
- \(y\) must be increased by 1.

So, the final state is:
State: **`n` must be less than 15, `m` must be less than 10, `y` must be increased by 1**
