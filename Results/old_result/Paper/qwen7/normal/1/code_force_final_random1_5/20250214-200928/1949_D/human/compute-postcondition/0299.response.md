Output State: **`nx` is 'SF', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating 'F' to its current value. Since `nx` was either 'S' or 'F', after adding 'F', it becomes 'SF'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged as the code only modifies `nx`.
