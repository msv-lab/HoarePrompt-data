The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t indicating the number of books, followed by an integer n and a list of n integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the sum of the maximum page count of the first n-1 books and the page count of the last book. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
