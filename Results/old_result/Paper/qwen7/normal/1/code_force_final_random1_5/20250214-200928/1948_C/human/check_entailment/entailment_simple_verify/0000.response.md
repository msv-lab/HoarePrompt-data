### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to understand why the original assessment might be incorrect.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `half_n = n // 2`: This splits the grid into two halves.
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `half_n - 2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - For each `i` in the loop, it checks if `row1[2 * i + 1]` is `<` and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is `<`.
   - If this condition is met, it immediately returns `'No'`.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it checks if `row1[n - 1]` is `<` and `row2[n - 2]` is `<`.
   - If both conditions are true, it returns `'No'`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the input:
```
4
<>><
><>>
```

- **Step-by-Step Execution:**
  1. `half_n = 2` (since `n = 4`).
  2. Loop iterates from `0` to `1`:
     - For `i = 0`:
       - `row1[1] = '<'` and `row2[0] = '<'` or `row2[2] = '>'`. Since `row2[0] = '<'`, the condition is met, and the function returns `'No'`.

The function indeed returns `'No'` for this case, which seems correct based on the logic provided. However, let's consider another example to ensure the function works correctly in all scenarios.

#### Another Example:
Consider the input:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```

- **Step-by-Step Execution:**
  1. `half_n = 2` (since `n = 4`).
  2. Loop iterates from `0` to `1`:
     - For `i = 0`:
       - `row1[1] = '>'` and `row2[0] = '>'` or `row2[2] = '>'`. Neither condition is met.
     - For `i = 1`:
       - `row1[3] = '<'` and `row2[2] = '>'` or `row2[4] = '>'`. Neither condition is met.
  3. After the loop, it checks:
     - `row1[3] = '<'` and `row2[2] = '>'`. Neither condition is met.
  4. The function returns `'Yes'`.

This example shows that the function correctly handles the scenario where the robot can reach `(2, n)`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` does not have a logical flaw. It correctly simulates the conditions under which the robot cannot reach `(2, n)` and returns `'No'` accordingly. In the remaining cases, it returns `'Yes'`, which is also correct.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the given examples.
