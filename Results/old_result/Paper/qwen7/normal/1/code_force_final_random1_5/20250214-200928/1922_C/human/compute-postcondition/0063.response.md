Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `x` and `y` are integers entered by the user and they are assigned these values.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

Here, `d1` is a dictionary whose keys and values are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since the values of `x` and `y` are determined by user input, we cannot determine the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`. However, we know that `x` and `y` are integers entered by the user.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the value of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
