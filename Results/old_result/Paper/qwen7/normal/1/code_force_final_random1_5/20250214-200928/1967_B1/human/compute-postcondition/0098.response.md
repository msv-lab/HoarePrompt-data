Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is `count + 1`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (count + 1))`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to be the integer division of `n` by `count + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `g` is used in the calculation of `ans`, which remains as `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
