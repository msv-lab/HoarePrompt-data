To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\)

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- \(n\) is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- \(m\) is an integer greater than or equal to 6.
- \(y\) has been increased by 1.
- \(cnt\) remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must still be true after the next iteration. Let's consider each condition separately:

### Condition 1: \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
- Since \(y\) has been increased by 1, \(x + y\) will increase by 1.
- Therefore, \((x + y + 1) * x \leq n\) must hold true for the loop to continue.
- This means \(n\) must be large enough to accommodate this new value.

### Condition 2: \((x + y) * y \leq m\)
- Similarly, since \(y\) has been increased by 1, \(x + y\) will increase by 1.
- Therefore, \((x + y + 1) * (y + 1) \leq m\) must hold true for the loop to continue.
- This means \(m\) must be large enough to accommodate this new value.

Given these requirements, the states that need to be adjusted are \(n\) and \(m\). Specifically, \(n\) must be large enough to satisfy \((x + y + 1) * x \leq n\), and \(m\) must be large enough to satisfy \((x + y + 1) * (y + 1) \leq m\).

Since the exact values of \(x\) and \(y\) are not specified, we cannot provide specific numerical adjustments, but we can state the general requirement.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be large enough to satisfy \((x + y + 1) * x \leq n\), `m` must be large enough to satisfy \((x + y + 1) * (y + 1) \leq m\)**
