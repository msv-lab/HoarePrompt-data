Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1 or 2, `n` is the same as the initial value, `x` is an input string, the values of `a[j]` and `b[j]` are updated based on the string `x`, and the list `xx` contains the string `x`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` must be between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1 and `b[i]` is increased by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then no changes are made to `a[j]`, `b[j]`, and `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is between 2 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `x[j - 1]` equals 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` equals 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
