The function accepts two non-negative integers, `a` and `b`, where `b` is not zero. It returns three values: `x`, `y`, and `g`. If `b` is zero, it returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` as the original value. Otherwise, it recursively calculates `x`, `y`, and `g` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, returning `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g` respectively.
