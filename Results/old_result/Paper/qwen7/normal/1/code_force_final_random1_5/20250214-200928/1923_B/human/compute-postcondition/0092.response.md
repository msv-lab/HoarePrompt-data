Output State: All elements in `a` that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` that were non-zero have been reduced to zero, `rest` is equal to zero, `distance` has been incremented by twice the number of iterations the loop executed, and `pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all elements in `a` corresponding to `sorted_indices` were processed, otherwise `pos` is one less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `rest` will be zero because all possible reductions have been made. The `distance` variable will have been incremented by twice the number of iterations, as it increases by 2 with each iteration. The `pos` variable will be at the end of `sorted_indices` if every element in `a` corresponding to `sorted_indices` was successfully reduced to zero, or just before the end if the last element could not be fully reduced due to insufficient `rest`. All elements in `a` that had non-zero values at the start and corresponded to indices in `sorted_indices` will now be zero.
