Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. According to the problem description, the game involves taking turns and removing one coin from the current wallet until a player cannot make a valid move. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not simulate these turns or the removal of coins. Instead, they simply determine the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. This approach does not account for the actual gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to swap wallets and the requirement to remove a coin from the current wallet. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for the given problem description.
