### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of her resulting array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The key is to understand how the game progresses and how the MEX is calculated.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not correctly implement the logic for the game described. Specifically, it uses a function `func_1` which does not follow the rules of the game.
   - The function `func_1` seems to be attempting to find a sequence of numbers that are not visited, but it does not correctly simulate the game's turns and the construction of the array `c`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a`.
   - Alice always picks an element and appends it to `c` and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element and removes it from `a`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice can ensure that the MEX is maximized by always picking the smallest available number that hasn't been picked yet.
   - Bob can ensure that the MEX is minimized by picking the smallest available number that hasn't been picked yet.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Use a set to keep track of the numbers picked by Alice and Bob.
   - Simulate the game by alternating turns and updating the set.
   - Determine the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

6. **Given Code Issues**:
   - The provided code does not simulate the game correctly. It does not handle the turns alternately and does not construct the array `c` properly.
   - The function `func_1` does not reflect the game's rules and logic.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic and does not produce the correct output. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
