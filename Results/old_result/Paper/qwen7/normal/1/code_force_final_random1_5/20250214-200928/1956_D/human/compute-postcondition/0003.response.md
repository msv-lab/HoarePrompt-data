To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the function `func_2(a)`.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`.

The function `func_2(a)` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, so we need to infer its behavior from typical naming conventions and common operations on lists. Typically, such functions might return:
- `s`: the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `m`: the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `ops`: the number of operations performed (though this is not explicitly stated, it could be inferred as the length of the list `a` since each element is processed once).

Based on these inferences:
- `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `ops` is likely the length of the list `a`, which is `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the sum of all elements in the list `a` and the maximum value in the list `a`.

Output: **the sum of all elements in the list `a` and the maximum value in the list `a`**
