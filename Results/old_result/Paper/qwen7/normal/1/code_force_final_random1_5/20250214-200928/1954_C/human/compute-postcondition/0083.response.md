Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is equal to `len(a)`, meaning `i` is the length of the list `a`.
   - For every index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new[j]` contains the minimum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`.
   - Similarly, `new2[j]` contains the maximum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
   ```

Given this information, let's determine what will be printed:

- The `new` list is constructed such that each element `new[j]` is the minimum of `a[j]` and `b[j]`.
- The `print` statement joins all elements of the `new` list into a single string, with each element converted to a string and concatenated together.

Since the exact contents of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values that will be printed. However, we can describe the process and the format of the output.

Output: **a string where each character is the string representation of the minimum value between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`**
