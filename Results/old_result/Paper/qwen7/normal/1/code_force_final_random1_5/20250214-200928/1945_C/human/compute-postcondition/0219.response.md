Output State: `lst` will contain all positions `i + 1` where both `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` are greater than or equal to 50; `mini` will be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst` after all iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `lst` will include all positions `i + 1` where the conditions related to the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s` are met. The variable `mini` will hold the smallest value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst` after processing all elements in `lst`.
