Output State: **`c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, and `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `c1 = c2 - 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `c2`. The other variables (`d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `ops`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `c2` is updated to its original value minus 1, while the rest of the variables retain their initial states.
