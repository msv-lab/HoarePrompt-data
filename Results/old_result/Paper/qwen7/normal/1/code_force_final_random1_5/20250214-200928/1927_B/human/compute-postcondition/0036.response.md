Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `j` and `l`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to `j + 1`. This means `j` is already incremented by 1 before the loop starts.
   - `l` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `l`.
   - Since `j` is already 1 (because `j` is `j + 1`), the loop will start with `j = 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `l`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` is already 1, so no adjustment is needed for `j`.
   - `l` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `ans` is an empty list, which is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `array` is a reversed version of the original list of integers, which is also not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `alp` is a list of characters from 'a' to 'z', which is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution.

Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `l` (it must be greater than 1).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `l` must be greater than 1**
