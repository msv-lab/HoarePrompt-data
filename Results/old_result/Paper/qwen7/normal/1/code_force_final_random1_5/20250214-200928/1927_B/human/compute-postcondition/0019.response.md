Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, which is an input integer; `array` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` and then accessing the corresponding index in the list `alp`; `i` is `i + 1`; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` creates a new list `rev_array` which is the reverse of the original `array`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
