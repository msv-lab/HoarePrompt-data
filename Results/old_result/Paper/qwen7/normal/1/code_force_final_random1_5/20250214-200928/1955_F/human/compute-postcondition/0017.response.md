Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and each of these elements is an odd integer.
   - `cnt` is the sum of 1 and the floor division of each element in `a` (from the first to the last) by 2.

2. **Loop Statement**: The loop statement is:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. Each iteration of the loop does not change the values of `a` or `cnt` directly but rather processes the input and updates the state based on the input.

4. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop does not explicitly change the values of `a` or `cnt` within the loop body (as indicated by "the loop body is omitted"), the only thing that changes is the number of iterations of the loop.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be at least 1 more than the current number of iterations.

Given that the loop has already run for some number of iterations, let's denote the number of iterations that have already occurred as `k`. The next iteration would require the input to be `k + 1`.

Since the loop head does not involve `a` or `cnt`, the state of `a` and `cnt` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and each of these elements is an odd integer, `cnt` is the sum of 1 and the floor division of each element in `a` (from the first to the last) by 2.**
