Output State: **`ans` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` must be an integer or a float that allows the range to include integers from 1 up to and including the integer part of the square root of `x` + 1, and `x % i == 0`. Additionally, `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `(x - n * i) % i` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value (`1`) and the value of `i` (`2`). Since `2` is greater than `1`, `ans` is updated to `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
