Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `word` is a string based on the value of the new `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `int(input())` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` replaces the initial value of `n` with a new integer input from the user. The other variables (`word`, `i`, and `int(input())`) remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
