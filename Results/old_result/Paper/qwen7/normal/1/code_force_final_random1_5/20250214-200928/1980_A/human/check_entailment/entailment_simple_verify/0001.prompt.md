You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Each test case consists of `n`, `m`, and a string `a`, and `missing` is computed based on these inputs as described in the loop body.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the number of test cases (`t`) and the test cases themselves (`test_cases`).
2. The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is appropriate for the problem statement.
3. For each test case, the function calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using a list `freq`.
4. It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
5. The function sums up the missing problems across all difficulty levels and appends this value to the `results` list.
6. Finally, it returns the list of results for each test case.

Given that the code follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles the examples provided correctly, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
