Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [4, 1, 2, 1], `tot` is 0, `pow` is 8, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `tot = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `tot`. This changes the value of `tot` from 1 to 0. All other variables (`a`, `L`, `pow`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
