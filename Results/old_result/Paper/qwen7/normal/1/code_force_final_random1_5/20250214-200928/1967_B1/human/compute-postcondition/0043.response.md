Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m`**.

The code updates the value of `countmins` to be `int(count - 1)`, which means `countmins` is now `int(2 - 1)` or simply `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
