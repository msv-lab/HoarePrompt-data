Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and the difference `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.
