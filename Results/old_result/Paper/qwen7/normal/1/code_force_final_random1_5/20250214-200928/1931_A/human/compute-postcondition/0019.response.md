Output State: **`word` is 'zz', `n` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, and `int(input())` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code appends `'zz'` to the `word` string. Since `word` was initially an empty string, after appending `'zz'`, `word` becomes `'zz'`. The value of `n` remains an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, and `int(input())` remains unchanged.
