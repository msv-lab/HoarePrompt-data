Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, `ops` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ops`. This does not affect the values of `d`, `previous`, `b`, or `path_ba`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values. The only change is that `ops` is now an empty list.
