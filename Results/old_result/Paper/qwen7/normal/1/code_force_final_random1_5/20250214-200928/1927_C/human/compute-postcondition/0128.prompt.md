Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `newk` is `k // 2`.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is not present in both lists `a` and `b`, and if `i` is in list `a`, `aOnes` does not exceed `newk` or `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`. If `i` is in list `b`, `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`; `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is `i + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is `k + 1`. If `i` is in both lists `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` remains unchanged; otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in both lists, and `i` is in list `a` and `aOnes` does not exceed `newk`, then `aOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is in list `b` and `bOnes` does not exceed `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
