Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and an array a consisting of n integers (where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each a_j). It returns information based on the input values for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of values for `t`, `n`, and an array `a`. The function processes these inputs and produces an output for each test case without requiring any additional parameters beyond those described.
