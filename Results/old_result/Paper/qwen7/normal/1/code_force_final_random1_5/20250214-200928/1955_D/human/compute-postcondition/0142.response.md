Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**: The postcondition describes the behavior of the loop body but does not affect the loop's continuation condition directly. It only describes what happens inside the loop.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop head variables**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

5. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Ensure `i` is still within the range**: For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `m`.

Given that `i` was within the range at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of the list `a` (i.e., `i + 1 < m`), and `b_values` is a set of integers.**
