Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

3. **Current state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is one more than the length of `a` and equals the previous value of `i` plus 1. This implies that `i` is already set to `len(a) + 1`.

4. **Determine the adjustment needed**: Since `i` is currently `len(a) + 1`, it is not less than `len(a)`. Therefore, to make the loop execute the first time, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `len(a)`.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to change the state such that `i` is less than `len(a)`.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`**, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop iterations; `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution; the condition `i != len(a)` is now false.
