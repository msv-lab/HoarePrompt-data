Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by 3, `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by 2, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing `u` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Initially, `v` was the second integer from the input decreased by 1, so now it is the second integer from the input decreased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
