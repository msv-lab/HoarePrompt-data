Output State: `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string), `i` is `n+1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]' holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `gr` will contain `n` strings, each read from user input. The variable `i` will be set to `n+1` because it starts from `n-1` and increments by 1 in each iteration. The values of `ans` and `impossible` will be determined based on the final state of the list `gr`.
