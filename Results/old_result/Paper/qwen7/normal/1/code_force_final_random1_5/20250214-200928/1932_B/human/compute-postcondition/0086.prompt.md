Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for test in test_cases:
    n, a = test
    current_year = 0
    for ai in a:
        if current_year % ai == 0:
            next_year = current_year + ai
        else:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
        current_year = next_year
    results.append(current_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing the last computed `next_year`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first element of `test_cases`, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is undefined, `current_year` is equal to the last computed `next_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `current_year` is the last computed `next_year` after processing all elements in `a`; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the second element of `test_cases`; `a` is a list with one element which is `test`; `ai` is undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list with one element `test`, `ai` is `test`, `current_year` is the smallest multiple of `test` that is greater than or equal to the initial value plus all increments made during the loop's iterations, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
