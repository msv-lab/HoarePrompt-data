Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `power` is less than `n` - 1, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The value of `power` is decremented by 1. Since `power` was originally less than `n`, after decrementing by 1, `power` is now less than `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
