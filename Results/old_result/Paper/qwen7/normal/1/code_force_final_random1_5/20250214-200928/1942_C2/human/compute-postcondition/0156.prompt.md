Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not yet defined, and the list of x distinct integers is also not yet defined.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is equal to 1 if the sum of the first element (`a[0]`) and `n` minus the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) equals 2. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even and `y` is greater than the half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 2; `ans` is incremented by `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is the sum of 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that differ by exactly 2, plus 1, plus the sum of `(a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy the condition `(a[j+1] - a[j]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1`, without the total decrement of `y` which is the sum of `((a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1)` for each such pair, and the current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and greater than `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1`, and `ans` is incremented by `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is incremented by `y`, `tmp` contains elements that are half of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` where those differences are even and greater than 2, and `ans` includes the count of times the difference between consecutive elements was exactly 2. If the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` holds, then `tmp` will be appended with the value \((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2\) and `y` will be decreased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1\), and `ans` will be increased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2\). Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`, `y`, and `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
