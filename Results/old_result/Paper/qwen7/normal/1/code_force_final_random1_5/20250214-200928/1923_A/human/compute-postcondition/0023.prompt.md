Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and we read an input for `t`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = ''.join(input('').split())
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string created by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `_` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t < 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `_` is 0, `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces; `n` is the integer input by the user; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`; `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`; `_` is 1; `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
