Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for itest in range(0, ntest, 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `itest` and `ntest`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ntest` is an input integer.
   - `itest` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer from the user.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `itest` is less than `ntest`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `itest` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `itest` must be incremented by 1 (since the increment step in the range function is 1).
   - Therefore, `itest` should be 2.
   - The value of `ntest` remains unchanged as it is determined by the input and does not change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ntest` remains the same as it was before.
   - `itest` is now 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it was before.
   - `a` remains the same as it was before.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is 2, `n` is an input integer from the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces.**
