t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 \cdot \min(n, m). Each test case consists of two arrays a and b, where a contains n integers and b contains m integers, and each integer in both arrays is in the range 1 to 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5.
