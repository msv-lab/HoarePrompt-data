Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, and `new2[i]` is reassigned to `min(a[i], b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables (`new2[i]`, `new[i]`, `a[i]`, and `new2[i]`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition that `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1` is still valid, and `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]` remains true since no operations affect these values.
