Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the `if` statement is flawed and does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. We then need to determine how many fireworks can be launched within that interval and still be visible at the same time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously
        # Each installation can launch one additional firework just before the LCM interval
        max_fireworks = lcm_ab // a + lcm_ab // b - 1
        
        print(max_fireworks)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program calculates the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determines the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula derived from the properties of LCM.
