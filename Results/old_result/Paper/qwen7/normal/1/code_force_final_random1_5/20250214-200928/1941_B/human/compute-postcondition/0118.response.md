Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is the value of `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the loop or if statement to exit, while the values of the variables `stop`, `opNum`, `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, `a[i + 2]`, and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement, and `_` remains `0`.
