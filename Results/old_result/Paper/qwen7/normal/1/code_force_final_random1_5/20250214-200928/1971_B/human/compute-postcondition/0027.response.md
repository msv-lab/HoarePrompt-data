Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a sorted string of `s`, `c` is the sorted string of `s` in descending order. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
