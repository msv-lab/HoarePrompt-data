Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`
   - `q` is the length of the list `a`
   - `i` is 1
   - `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`
   - `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`
   - `l` is 1

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `m`: This is a formula that involves elements from lists `b`, `bd`, `ad`, and `a`, as well as the value of `ql`.
   - `q`: This is the length of the list `a`.
   - `i`: This is explicitly given as 1.
   - `s`: This is the position in the list `a` where `ql` is inserted to maintain sorted order.
   - `ql`: This is an input integer minus the element at index `s - 1` in the list `a`.
   - `l`: This is explicitly given as 1.

3. **Calculating `m`:**
   - To find the exact value of `m`, we need to know the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ad[s]`, and `ql`.
   - Since these values are not explicitly given, we can only describe `m` in terms of these components.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(int(m), end=' ')`.

Given the initial state, the print statement will output the integer value of `m`.

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s]))**
