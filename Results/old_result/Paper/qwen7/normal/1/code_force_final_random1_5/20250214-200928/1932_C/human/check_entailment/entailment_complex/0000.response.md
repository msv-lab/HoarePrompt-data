Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1`.
2. The function `func_1` first constructs a list `b` by iterating through the string `s` and appending elements from `a` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
3. After constructing `b`, the function calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` and appends each intermediate result to the list `ans`.
4. The function then returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which matches the expected output format.
5. The main loop in the program correctly calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function `func_1` and the main loop appear to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
