Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is the value of `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, and `i` must be in the range `[0, n-2]`, `_` is `0**.

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` subtracts `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`. Since `opNum` is the value of `a[i]`, the new value of `a[i + 1]` becomes `a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
