Output State: **`i` is `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` reflects the net effect of all the increments and decrements performed over the iterations, and `ans` is incremented by 1; `b` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `b`. The values of `i`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states.
