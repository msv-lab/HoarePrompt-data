Output State: **`x` is a list where the element at index `j - 1` is 'S' + 1, and all other elements in the list retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `b` by 1. Since `b` is the same list as `x` in the initial state, the element at index `j - 1` (which was previously 'S') is now 'S' + 1. All other elements in the list `x` remain unchanged.
