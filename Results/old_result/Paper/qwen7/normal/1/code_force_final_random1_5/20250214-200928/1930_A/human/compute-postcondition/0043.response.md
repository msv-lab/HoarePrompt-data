Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and \( 2n \) integers. It then sorts these integers and calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element. The function prints this sum for each test case and leaves the sorted list and the value of \( n \) unchanged after processing.**
