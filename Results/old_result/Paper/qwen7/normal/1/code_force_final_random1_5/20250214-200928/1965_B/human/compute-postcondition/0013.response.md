Output State: **`i` is 3, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is [4, 8]**.

Explanation: The initial state has `i` as 3, `l` as the length of `b` (which is greater than or equal to 3), and `ans` containing the value 4. The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 3, `2 ** i` equals 8. Therefore, `ans` changes from `[4]` to `[4, 8]`. The values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged.
