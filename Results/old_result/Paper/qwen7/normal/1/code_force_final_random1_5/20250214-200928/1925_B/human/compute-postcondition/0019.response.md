Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Since `i` is defined as `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, this value does not change. The value of `x` also remains unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`.
