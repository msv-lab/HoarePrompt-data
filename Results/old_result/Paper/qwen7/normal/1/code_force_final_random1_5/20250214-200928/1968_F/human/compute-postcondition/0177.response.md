Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 7, `l` is int(data[idx]), `r` is int(data[idx + 1]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `results` remains unchanged, and `v2` is reassigned to `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.**

Explanation: The code reassigns `v2` to the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, which does not change the value of `v2` since it was already assigned to the same value before. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
