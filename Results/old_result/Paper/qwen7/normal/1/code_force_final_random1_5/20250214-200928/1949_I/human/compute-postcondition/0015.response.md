Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `tot` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, which will be `n-1`, `ok` is False, and the values of `visited`, `coef`, and the initial conditions for `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain as they were initialized.**

The variable `ok` is set to `False` in the given code snippet, but no other changes are made to the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `bipartite`, `tot`, `n`, `visited`, `coef`, `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged.
