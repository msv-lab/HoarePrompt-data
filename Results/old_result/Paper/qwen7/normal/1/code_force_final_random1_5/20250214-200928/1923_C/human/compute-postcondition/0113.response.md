Output State: **`i` is the total sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1's in `l`, `p` is now `[0]`, `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l` for each prefix sum, `l` is updated with a new list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `p` with the single element `[0]`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `c`, `l`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
