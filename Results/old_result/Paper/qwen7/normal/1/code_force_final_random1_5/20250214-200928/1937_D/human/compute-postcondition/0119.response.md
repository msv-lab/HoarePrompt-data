Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l]`, and `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[r - l]` subtracts the value of `B[r - l]` from `b`. Since `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, the subtraction is valid. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
