Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers updated from input, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in `a`, and the remaining number of iterations is the input value minus 1. If the first three elements of `a` are equal and each is an odd number, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.
