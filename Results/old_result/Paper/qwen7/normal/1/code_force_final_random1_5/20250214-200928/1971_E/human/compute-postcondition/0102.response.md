Output State: **`i` is within the range `[3, len(a))`, `bd` contains the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, starting from the second element of `b`, `v` is a list containing four elements: `0`, `ad[i-1] / bd[i-1]`, `ad[i] / bd[i]`, and `ad[i] / bd[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Initially, `v` contained three elements: `0`, `ad[i-1] / bd[i-1]`, and `ad[i] / bd[i]`. After appending, `v` now contains four elements: `0`, `ad[i-1] / bd[i-1]`, `ad[i] / bd[i]`, and `ad[i] / bd[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
