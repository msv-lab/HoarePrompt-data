Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero (i.e., `n` is not equal to 0).

2. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first input number.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the second input number.
   - `L` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero (i.e., `n` must not be equal to 0).
   - The values of `k` and `L` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is an empty list**
