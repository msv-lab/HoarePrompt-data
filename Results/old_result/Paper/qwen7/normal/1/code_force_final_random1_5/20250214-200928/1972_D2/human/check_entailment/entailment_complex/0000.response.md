Reasoning:
- **Function 1**: This function correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \leq \sqrt{n}\) and checks if the pair \((x, y)\) meets the criteria. If \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\), it adds the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\) to the count `cnt`. The logic for checking the conditions and updating `cnt` is correct.
- **Function 2**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. The function ensures that `func_1()` is called exactly \(t\) times, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the provided states, both functions correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
