Output State: `i` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `j` is the length of the list `l`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, as each element is added to `i` during each iteration. The variable `j` will be equal to the length of the list `l`, as it is incremented once for each element in the list. The lists `p` and `c` will contain the cumulative sums of `l` and the count of 1s in `l`, respectively, as described in the loop body.
