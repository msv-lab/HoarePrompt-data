Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / 2) - (m - 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is `m - 1`. Since `g` was previously set to `int(n / 2)`, the new value of `g` is `int(n / 2) - (m - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
