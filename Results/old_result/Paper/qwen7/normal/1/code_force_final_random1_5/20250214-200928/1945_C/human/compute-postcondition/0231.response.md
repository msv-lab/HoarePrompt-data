Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `lst` must contain at least one element.
- `elem` is now the second element of `lst`.
- `mini` remains unchanged.
- `final` contains the first two elements of `lst`.

### Loop Head:
```
for elem in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst` using the variable `elem`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, `lst` must contain at least one element, and `elem` should be the third element of `lst` (since it was the second element in the previous iteration).

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `mini` remains unchanged, its value does not change.
   - `final` will now contain the first three elements of `lst` because `elem` is now the third element.
   - `lst` must still contain at least one element, but since `elem` is now the third element, `lst` must have at least three elements.

### Updated State:
- `lst` must contain at least three elements.
- `elem` is now the third element of `lst`.
- `mini` remains unchanged.
- `final` contains the first three elements of `lst`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`lst` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is now the third element of `lst`, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` contains the first three elements of `lst`.**
