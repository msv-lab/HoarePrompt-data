Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 2, `b` is updated to the list of strings obtained from the new input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is now `[0]`, `n` is equal to the first element of `b` converted to an integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, and `l` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0; `suf` is updated such that suf[0] is equal to suf[0] + l[0]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1; `suf` has an updated element at index `i` which is equal to `suf[1] + l[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2; `suf` is a list with an additional element at the end, which is equal to `suf[2] + l[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
