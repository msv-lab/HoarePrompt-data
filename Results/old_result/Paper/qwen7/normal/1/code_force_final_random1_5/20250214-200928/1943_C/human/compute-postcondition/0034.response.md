The `while True` loop does not have any conditions based on variables in its head, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Given that the loop can certainly execute one more time, we do not need to adjust any states based on the loop condition.

However, since we need to provide an answer following the given format, we will state that no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[n]` (which is `-1`), and the current value of `n` is `-1`**
