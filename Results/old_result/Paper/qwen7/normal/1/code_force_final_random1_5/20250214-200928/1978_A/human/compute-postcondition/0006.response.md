Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` as an input integer and retains the condition that `t` must be greater than 0.
