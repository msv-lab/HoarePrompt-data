Based on the initial state provided, after the loop completes all its iterations:

- `i` will be `n - m - 1`
- `cnt_b[a[i]]` will be either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remain the same
- `a[i + m]` will be either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` will be decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` will be not in `b_values` and the other conditions will remain unchanged
- `curr` will hold the final count as per the loop's logic
- `ans` will contain the total count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the total count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of times curr was greater than or equal to k)**
