Output State: **`power` is equal to its original value plus 1, `n_cases` is greater than 0, and `n` is greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1. Since `power` was originally less than `n`, after the increment, `power` is now equal to its original value plus 1. The conditions for `n_cases` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
