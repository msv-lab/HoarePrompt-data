Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 and now equals `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1`, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b`. Since `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, it means `a[i + m]` exists in the list `b`. The count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is already greater than 0 and has been increased by 1 before this operation, so it remains greater than 0 but is now reduced by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
