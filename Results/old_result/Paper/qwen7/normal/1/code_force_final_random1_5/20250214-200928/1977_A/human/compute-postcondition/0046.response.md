Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split, `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer from the split, `m` is assigned the value of the second input integer from the split.** 

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. The only difference is the condition under which the if part is executed, but since the else part covers all other cases, the overall postcondition does not change.
