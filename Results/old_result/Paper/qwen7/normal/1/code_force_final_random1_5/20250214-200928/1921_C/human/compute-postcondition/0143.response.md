Based on the initial state provided:

- The sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.
- `array2` contains elements based on the conditions met during the loop execution.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement will print the string `'No'` regardless of the conditions or values of other variables like `array2`, `n`, `b`, or `f`.

Output: **No**
