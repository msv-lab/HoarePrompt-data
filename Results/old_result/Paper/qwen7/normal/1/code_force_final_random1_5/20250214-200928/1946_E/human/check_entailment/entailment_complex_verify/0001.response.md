### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions do not address the core combinatorial counting required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are related to modular arithmetic and do not contribute to the combinatorial logic needed to count the valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

However, the annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of how the program actually works, and it appears to implement a valid combinatorial approach to solve the problem. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `facts` to store factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\) up to \(200002\).
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It also reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Validation of Indices:**
   - It checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0 because no valid permutation exists.

4. **Counting Permutations:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 1 and `kol` to `n`.
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates combinations to place the remaining elements in the valid positions.
   - It then iterates over the prefix maximums in reverse order and performs similar calculations.
   - Finally, it multiplies the results of these calculations and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The annotated code shows that the program correctly implements the combinatorial logic to count the valid permutations based on the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment was incorrect in stating that the provided program is incorrect.
