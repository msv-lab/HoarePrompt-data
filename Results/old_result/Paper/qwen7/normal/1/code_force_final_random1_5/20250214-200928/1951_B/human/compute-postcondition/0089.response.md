Output State: **`i` is now the second element of the list `s`, `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, but the value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to the second element of the list `s`. The precondition that `s` must have at least 2 elements is still valid.
