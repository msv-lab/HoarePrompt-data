You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Annotated Code:

cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and cas_de_test is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3

        else:

    #State: Output State: The `resultats` list will contain the final results for all the tuples in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`, the loop will compute `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs = total_points // 2`, and `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Depending on the conditions, `resultats` will append either `-1` or `egalites // 2` to itself. After all iterations, `resultats` will be a list containing the results for each tuple in `cas_de_test`, with `-1` appended if any condition fails, otherwise `egalites // 2`.
    #
    #The `total_matchs` and `egalites` variables will be recalculated for each tuple, but their specific values are not preserved outside the loop as they are used only within the loop body. The `total_points` variable will also be recalculated for each tuple but similarly does not persist outside the loop.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list named `resultats` which contains the results for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, the program calculates `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs = total_points // 2`, and `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Depending on certain conditions, the list `resultats` appends either `-1` or `egalites // 2` to itself. If any condition fails during the iteration, `-1` is appended; otherwise, `egalites // 2` is appended.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`. It returns a list named `resultats` containing the results for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, it calculates `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs = total_points // 2`, and `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If certain conditions are met, it appends `egalites // 2` to `resultats`; otherwise, it appends `-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and `cas_de_test` with predefined test cases. This part is correct and serves as input for the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case and calculates the total points and total matches.
   - It checks if the total points are even, which is necessary because each match contributes either 2 points (to the winners) or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - It then calculates the total number of matches from the total points.
   - It checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 (since there are only 3 players) or if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total number of matches, which would be impossible.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula derived from the points distribution.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating an invalid configuration.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the list of results, which are then printed.

### Analysis:

- **Total Points Check**: The check for `total_points % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points are even, which is necessary for the points distribution to be valid.
- **Total Matches Calculation**: The calculation of `total_matchs = total_points // 2` correctly determines the total number of matches.
- **Match Constraints**: The checks `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` ensure that the number of matches and the highest score are feasible.
- **Draw Calculation**: The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and the subsequent division by 2 correctly calculates the number of draws.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all test cases and outputs the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
