The `while True` loop does not have any condition based on the variables in the loop head. This means that the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Since there are no conditions to check within the loop head itself, no adjustments are needed to the given states to ensure the loop executes one more time.

However, we can still provide a clear state description:

State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[-1, n]`, and if `n` is `-1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always proceed to the next iteration without any additional state adjustments.
