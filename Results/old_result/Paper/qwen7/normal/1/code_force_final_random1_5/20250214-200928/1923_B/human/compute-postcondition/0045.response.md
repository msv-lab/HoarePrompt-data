Output State: **`rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is increased by 1, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0, and the first element of `a` that corresponds to `sorted_indices[pos]` is now 0.**

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as per the initial state, specifically, `rest` is still equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` is still equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is still equal to 0, and the first element of `a` that corresponds to `sorted_indices[pos]` is now 0.
