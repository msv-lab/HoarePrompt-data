Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged except that `t` now holds the value of the integer input. The value of `n` is not affected by this line of code.
