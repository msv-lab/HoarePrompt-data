Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1, `s` must be a non-empty list, and `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is less than or equal to `h`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. Initially, `ans1` is 0, so after executing this line, `ans1` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
