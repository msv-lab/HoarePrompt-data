Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an empty list, `b` is the last input string from the user, and the final state of `k[0]` is either equal to `k[1]` or not equal to `k[1]`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b`, `b` is the input string from the user, `num` must be a positive integer, and if '1' is in the string `b`, `k` contains the count of '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the original string `b` plus the count of '1's in the new input string `b`, and `b` is the new input string from the user, `num` must be a positive integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is the count of '1's in the original string `b` plus the count of '1's in the new input string `b`, `b` is the new input string from the user, `num` is the new positive integer provided by the user, and if the new input string `b` contains the character '1', then `k` is updated to include the count of '1's in the new input string `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
