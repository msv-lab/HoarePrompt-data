Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in custos:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `c` and `custos`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `custos` list. Since `c` is being iterated over from the `custos` list, the loop will continue until all elements in `custos` have been processed.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `c` must be in the list `custos`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `c` is the variable being iterated over, it will take the next value from the `custos` list.
   - `y` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `custos` must still contain the list of values, but now it should exclude the value that was just processed (the previous `c`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `c` is the next element in the `custos` list, and `custos` is the remaining list after removing the previously processed element.

**State:**
- `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, excluding the previously processed value.
- `y` is 0.
- `c` is the next element in the `custos` list.

So, the final state is:
State: **`custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, excluding the previously processed value, `y` is 0, `c` is the next element in the `custos` list**.
