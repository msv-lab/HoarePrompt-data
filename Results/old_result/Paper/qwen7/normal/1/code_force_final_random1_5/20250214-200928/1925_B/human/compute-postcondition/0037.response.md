Output State: **`ans` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 1. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `ans` is set to 1, while `x` and `n` retain their initial states as input integers.
