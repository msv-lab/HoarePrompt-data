Output State: `a` is 0, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1], `pow` is 8, `tot` is 1.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `L`. Initially, `a` is 1, then it becomes 0, and remains 0 for the rest of the iterations. After the first iteration, `tot` is updated to 1, and `pow` is multiplied by 2. This process repeats for the remaining elements in `L`, with `a` being 0 for the second and third iterations. Therefore, `tot` remains 1, and `pow` is multiplied by 2 for each iteration, resulting in `pow` being 8 after all iterations.
