Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)` and is an integer; `l` is passed to `func_5(l)`**.

Explanation: The code simply calls the function `func_5(l)`, where `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. No variables are updated or assigned new values within this snippet. Therefore, the initial conditions remain valid, and only the call to `func_5(l)` is noted.
