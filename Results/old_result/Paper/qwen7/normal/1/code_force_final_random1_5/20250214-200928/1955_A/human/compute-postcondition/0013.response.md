Postcondition: `i` is 0, `A` is an integer entered by the user, `B` and `C` are integers entered by the user, and `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. If `A` is an even integer, then `A` remains unchanged and `X` is set to `A` divided by 2 using integer division. If `A` is an odd integer, then `X` is set to `A` divided by 2 using integer division.
