Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `impossible` is False
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `i` is 1
   - The condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds true

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` must be greater than 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `i < n - 1`, and `n` does not change within the loop.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `total` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `impossible` is False (remains unchanged).
   - `ans` is 'NO' (remains unchanged).
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 (remains unchanged).
   - `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - The condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` must hold true for `i = 2`, i.e., `gr[2][0] != gr[3][0] or gr[2][m - 1] != gr[3][m - 1]`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`impossible` is False, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the condition `gr[2][0] != gr[3][0] or gr[2][m - 1] != gr[3][m - 1]` holds true**.
