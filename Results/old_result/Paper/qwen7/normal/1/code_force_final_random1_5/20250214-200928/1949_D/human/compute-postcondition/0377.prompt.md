Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains the same, `xx` contains `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are lists where `a[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'F' at the `j-th` position across all inputs and `b[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'S' at the `j-th` position across all inputs, `sa` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `i-1` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition `a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `i-1` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition `b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be incremented to `n + 1`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n`, and for each iteration, it checks if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If both conditions are met, the integer `i` is appended to `sb`. Since the loop runs `n` times, `sb` will contain all integers from `1` to `n` that meet the specified condition, and `sa` will be empty because no element satisfies the condition `a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0` within the given constraints. Therefore, `sa` will be an empty list, and the length of `sa` will always be less than the length of `sb`, which will be `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: nx is a string consisting of 'S' and 'F' based on the conditions met during each iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 3, and `j` is 3 after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: nx is a string of length n-1, i is n+1, n is at least 4, and j is n+1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: nx is a string, `i` is 0, `j` is n+1, and `n` is at least 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
