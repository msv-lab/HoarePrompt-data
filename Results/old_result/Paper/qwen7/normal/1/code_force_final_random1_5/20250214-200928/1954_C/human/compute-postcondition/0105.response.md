Postcondition: **`i` is one more than the length of `a`; `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop iterations; `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution; the condition `i != len(a)` is true.**
