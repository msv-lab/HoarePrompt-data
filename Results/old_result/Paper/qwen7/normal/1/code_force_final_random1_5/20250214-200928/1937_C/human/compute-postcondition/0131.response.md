Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `res` is an input string.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` is not given.
- `best` remains unchanged, but the exact value of `best` is not given.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `k` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined what its value is. Similarly, `best` is also not defined with an explicit value. Therefore, we will keep `k` and `best` as they are in the output.

The output will include the literal string `'?'`, followed by the values of `k`, `best`, `k` again, and `i`.

Output: **'? k best k i' (where `k` and `best` are undefined values, and `i` is the incremented value of `i` from the initial state)**
