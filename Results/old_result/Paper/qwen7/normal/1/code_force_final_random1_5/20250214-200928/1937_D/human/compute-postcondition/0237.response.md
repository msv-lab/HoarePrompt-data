Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` is equal to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
