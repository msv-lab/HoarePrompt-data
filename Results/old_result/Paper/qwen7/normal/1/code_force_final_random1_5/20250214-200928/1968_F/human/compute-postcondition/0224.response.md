Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `idx` has been increased by 2.
