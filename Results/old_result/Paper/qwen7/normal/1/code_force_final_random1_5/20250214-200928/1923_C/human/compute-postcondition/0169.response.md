Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, q, c, l_i, and r_i. It returns a result based on the queries defined within the test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, followed by `n` and `q` (both positive integers), a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries each defined by `l_i` and `r_i` (positive integers). The function processes these inputs and returns results based on the specified queries.
