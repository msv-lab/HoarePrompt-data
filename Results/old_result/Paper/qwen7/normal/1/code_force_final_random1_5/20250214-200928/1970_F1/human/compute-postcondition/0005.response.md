Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an integer between 3 and 99, both are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary; `goal` is now `[[], []]`; `points` is now `[0, 0]`; `mov` is a dictionary mapping movement commands ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') to their corresponding changes in position coordinates; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the field with the entry '.B': (-1, -1)**.

The code `points = [0, 0]` updates the value of the `points` variable to `[0, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
