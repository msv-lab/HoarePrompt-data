Output State: **`start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing 0 and 1; `nums[2]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start + 1]` by 1. Given that `start` is 1, `start + 1` equals 2. Since `nums[1]` was a truthy value (which we can consider as 1 for simplicity), `nums[2]` was not initially defined or was 0 (as sets containing 0 and 1 do not give us information about other indices). After executing the code, `nums[2]` is decremented by 1, resulting in `nums[2]` being 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
