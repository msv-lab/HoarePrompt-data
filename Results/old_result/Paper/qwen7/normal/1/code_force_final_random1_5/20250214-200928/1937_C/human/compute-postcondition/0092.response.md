Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `best` is 5
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6
   - `i` is 5
   - `k` is 5
   - `res` is an input string

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the explanation, it updates `best` to the current value of `i` if `res` is '<'. However, since the exact loop body is not provided, we focus on the loop condition and the initial states.

4. **Current Iteration**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5, and `n` is at least 6. 

5. **Next Iteration**: 
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 6.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true. Since `n` is at least 6, this condition will be satisfied.

6. **States to Adjust**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 6.
   - `n`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `best` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `i` is 6, `k` is 5, and `res` is an input string.**
