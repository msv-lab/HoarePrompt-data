Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1, `ans` is 2 if `curr >= k`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is decremented by 1. Initially, `curr` was defined as the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 2. After decrementing `curr` by 1, it becomes the total count plus 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
