You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It checks if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` based on the direction of arrows in the grid.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not fully account for all possible paths the robot can take. Specifically, it only checks certain conditions and returns 'No' without considering other possible valid paths.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, and calls `func_1` to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.
   - The output is formatted correctly, but the correctness of the output depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Logic Flaws**:
  - The function checks specific conditions for the middle part of the grid (`2 * i + 1` and `2 * i` indices), but it does not handle the entire grid correctly.
  - It assumes that if an arrow points left at an odd index, the robot cannot reach the end, which is overly restrictive and does not cover all possible valid paths.
  - It does not consider the possibility of the robot moving up and down between rows.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the movement of the robot through the grid while respecting the directions of the arrows. We should check if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` by simulating its path.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_target(n, row1, row2):
    x, y = 1, 1  # Start at (1, 1)
    while True:
        if x == 2 and y == n:
            return True
        if x == 1 and y < n and row1[y] == '>':
            y += 1
        elif x == 1 and y > 1 and row1[y-1] == '<':
            y -= 1
        elif x == 2 and y < n and row2[y] == '>':
            y += 1
        elif x == 2 and y > 1 and row2[y-1] == '<':
            y -= 1
        else:
            break
        if x == 1:
            x = 2
        else:
            x = 1
    return False

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append('Yes' if can_reach_target(n, row1, row2) else 'No')
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not fully simulate the robot's movement and does not handle all possible paths. The corrected program above properly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

**Correctness: **False**
