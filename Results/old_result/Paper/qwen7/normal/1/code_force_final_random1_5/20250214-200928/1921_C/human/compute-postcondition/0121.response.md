Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables mentioned in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 1
   - `arr` is a list of integers
   - `array2` is a list of integers based on certain conditions

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Given that `n` is currently 1, the loop will run from `0` to `0`, meaning it will only execute once.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration (which would be the second iteration), `i` should be `2`.
   - `n` remains the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays `1`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be `2`.
   - `n` remains `1`.
   - `arr` and `array2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1**
