Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' concatenated with the original string value of `nx`, or "nxF". The variable `i` is `n`, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 4. If either `i` or `j` is found in the first quarter of the string `sb`, `nx` is 'S' concatenated with the original string value of `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` is set to "nxF".
