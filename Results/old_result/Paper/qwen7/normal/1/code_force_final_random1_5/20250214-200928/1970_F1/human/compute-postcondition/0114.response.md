Output State: **`line` is a string, `ind` is an index that is 1 more than the previous value, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`, `goal` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns a value to `tmp` based on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B'. If `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, `tmp` is set to 1. The values of `line`, `ind`, `elements[line[ind]]`, and `goal` remain unchanged from their initial states.
