Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` has been incremented by 1.
   - `r` is `r - 1`: This means `r` has been decremented by 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0: This indicates that `n` is still positive but its exact value is not specified.
   - `l` remains the same: This means `l` has not changed from its previous value.
   - `a` is equal to `A[l]`: This means `a` is the element at index `l` in the list `A`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`: Given that `r` has been decremented by 1, this expression simplifies to `x = r - l - 3`.
   - `b` is `b` if `x >= 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged: Since `x = r - l - 3` and `r` was decremented by 1, the value of `x` depends on the relationship between `r` and `l`. If `r - l - 3 >= 0`, then `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`.
   - We need to determine the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `x` to evaluate the expression.

Given the information:
- `i` is `i + 1` (so `i` is the original value plus 1).
- `a` is `A[l]`.
- `x` is `r - l - 3`, and since `r` was decremented by 1, `x` could be non-negative depending on the values of `r` and `l`.

Since the exact values of `r` and `l` are not specified, let's consider a general case where `x` is non-negative:
- If `x >= 0`, then `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.

For simplicity, let's assume `x >= 0` (the most straightforward scenario):
- `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

Combining these, the expression becomes:
\[ a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 \]
\[ = A[l] * 2 + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) * 2 + i + 1 \]

Since the exact values of `A[l]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, and `i` are not specified, we cannot simplify further without additional information. However, we know the structure of the expression.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **A[l] * 2 + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) * 2 + i + 1**
