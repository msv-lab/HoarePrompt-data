Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is calculated based on `ai_next`, `ai` is `ai_next`, and `test_cases` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `current_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. This does not change the value of `next_year` itself, nor does it affect `ai`, `ai_next`, or `test_cases`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `current_year` now being equal to `next_year` (which was previously set based on `ai` and `ai_next`), and `test_cases` remaining unchanged.
