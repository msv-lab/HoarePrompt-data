Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is "az"**.

Explanation: The code appends 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and 'z' to the `word` string. Since `n` is an input integer greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, `n - 28` will be an integer between -1 and 24 (inclusive). However, since `alphabet` presumably contains only valid characters (like letters), the character at index `n - 28` will be a valid character. Given the constraints, the character at index 0 of `alphabet` is 'a', and the character at the last valid index (which would be 25) is 'z'. Thus, `word` becomes "az".
