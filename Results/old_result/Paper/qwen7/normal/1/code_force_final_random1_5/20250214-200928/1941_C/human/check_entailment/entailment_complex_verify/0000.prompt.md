You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with a total length sum not exceeding 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is now 0 or less, which means there are no more iterations left. `a` is an input integer from the last iteration, `s` is the final input string from the last iteration, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, and `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the output of each iteration (which was the sum of `x` and `y`) has been printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, sums these counts, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` becomes non-positive, indicating the end of iterations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the string contains both "pie" and "map" substrings. According to the problem description, the program should remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. However, the current implementation simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the string "mappie":
- The program would count "map" as 1 and "pie" as 1, resulting in a deletion count of 2.
- However, the optimal solution is to delete the 'p' in "mappie" to make it "miae", which is beautiful. Thus, only 1 character needs to be deleted.

This shows that the program does not correctly implement the requirement to minimize deletions to make the string beautiful.
