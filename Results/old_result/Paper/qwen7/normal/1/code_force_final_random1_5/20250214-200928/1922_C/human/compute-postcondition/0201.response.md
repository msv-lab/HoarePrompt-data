Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `m` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The print statement is `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to know the values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]`. Since these values are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact numerical values. However, we can describe them in terms of the input and the list `d2`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
