Postcondition: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with the first element removed, `ans` is increased by `2 * y` plus `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`. If `y < gap // 2`, `ans` is further increased by `2 * y` and `y` is set to 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.
