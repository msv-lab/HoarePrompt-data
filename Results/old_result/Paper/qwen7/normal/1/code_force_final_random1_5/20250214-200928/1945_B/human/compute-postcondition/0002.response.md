Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `i` is still 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers read from the input.
