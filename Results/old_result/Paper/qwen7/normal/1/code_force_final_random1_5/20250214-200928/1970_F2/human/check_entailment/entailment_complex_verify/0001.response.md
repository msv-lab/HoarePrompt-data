### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It initializes dictionaries to store player positions, goal positions, and the Quaffle's position.
   - It correctly identifies the middle of the field and initializes the Quaffle's position.

2. **Movement and Action Handling:**
   - The program handles player movements and updates their positions correctly using `func_1`.
   - It checks for collisions with Bludgers and eliminates players accordingly.
   - However, the function `func_1` has a logical error. The function should return a tuple of new coordinates, but instead, it attempts to concatenate strings, which is incorrect. The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(a, b):
         (x, y) = a
         (dx, dy) = b
         return (x + dx, y + dy)
     ```
   - It correctly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
   - The program ensures that the Quaffle is moved to the middle of the field when a goal is scored.

3. **Event Logging:**
   - The program logs events such as scoring and player elimination correctly.
   - It prints events in the required format and order.

4. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates and prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete. While the program correctly handles most aspects of the problem, there is a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function should return a tuple of new coordinates, but instead, it attempts to concatenate strings, which is incorrect. This error could lead to incorrect movement of players and the Quaffle, potentially affecting the final score calculation.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
