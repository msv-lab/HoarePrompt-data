Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `comand` is equal to the list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the `comand` list to `obj` and the second element to `com`. The values of `t`, `time`, and `command` remain unchanged. `comand` is mentioned to be equal to `command`, indicating they are the same list.
