Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `ind` is being iterated over the range of `len(line)`. Therefore, the only variable that changes within the loop is `ind`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `ind` is less than `len(line)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is either 1 or 2.

3. **Determine the new value of `ind` for the next iteration**:
   - If `ind` was 1 in the previous iteration, the next value of `ind` would be 2.
   - If `ind` was 2 in the previous iteration, the next value of `ind` would be 3 (since the loop will stop if `ind` reaches `len(line)`).

4. **Check the postconditions for the next iteration**:
   - `len(line)` remains the same.
   - `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`.
   - `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`.
   - If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` now contains `(i, ind)`. However, since `ind` is incremented, this condition will not apply to the next iteration unless `ind` is 2 and `line[2][1]` is 'G'.

Given these points, let's update the state for the next iteration:

- If `ind` was 1, it will become 2.
- If `ind` was 2, it will become 3.

Since the loop will stop if `ind` reaches `len(line)`, we assume `ind` will be 2 for the next iteration unless `len(line)` is less than 3, in which case the loop would have stopped earlier.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ind` is 2, `len(line)` remains the same, `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` now contains `(i, ind)`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
