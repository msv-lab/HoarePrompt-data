Output State: **`i` is 1; `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`**

Explanation: The variable `dp` is assigned a boolean value based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression becomes `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`. The value of `dp` depends on whether `arr[1] - arr[2]` is greater than 1 or not, combined with the current value of `dp`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged.
