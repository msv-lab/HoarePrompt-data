Output State: `n` must be less than 15, `m` must be less than 10, `y` is 4, `x` is 3, and `cnt` remains unchanged.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\). Given that `x` is fixed at 3, `y` starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration. After three iterations, `y` becomes 4. However, since `n` is less than 15 and `m` is less than 10, the condition \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\) will no longer be satisfied when \(y = 4\) because \(3 + 4 = 7\), and \(7 \times 4 = 28 > 15\). Therefore, the loop terminates after the third iteration, and the values of `n` and `m` do not change. The variable `cnt` does not change either because the conditions inside the loop that increment `cnt` are no longer met.
