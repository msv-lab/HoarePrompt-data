Output State: `t` is less than or equal to 0, or `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer for each iteration.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must be less than or equal to 0 because the loop runs `t` times, and once `t` becomes 0 or negative, the loop stops executing. At this point, `n` will be the last input integer received during any of the iterations, and `nums` will be the list of integers corresponding to the last input string split and converted to integers.
