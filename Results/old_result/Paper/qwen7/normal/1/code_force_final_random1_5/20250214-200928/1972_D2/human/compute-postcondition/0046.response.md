Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Check the current state**:
   - `n` is at least 9.
   - `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `x` is 3.
   - `cnt` is the sum of all valid `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` values.

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with the current state**:
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`: 
     \[
     (x + y) * x = (3 + 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12
     \]
   - Check if `12 <= n`: Since `n` is at least 9, this condition is satisfied.
   - Check if `12 <= m`: Since `m` is at least 12, this condition is also satisfied.

Given that both conditions are already satisfied with the current state, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is at least 9, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12, `y` is 1, `x` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of all valid `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` values where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`**
