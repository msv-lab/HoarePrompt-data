Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 32, `m` is 1, `n` is `n - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decreased by `m`, which is 1. Since `n` must be non-zero and was previously calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` is `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
