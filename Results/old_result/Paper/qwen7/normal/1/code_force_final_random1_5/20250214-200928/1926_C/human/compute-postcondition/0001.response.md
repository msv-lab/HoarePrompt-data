The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. For the loop to execute the first time, `num` must not be equal to 0.

Right before the loop, `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 2 \times 10^5\). This means that `num` is already within the valid range, but we need to ensure that it is not 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary because `num` is already a positive integer, and it satisfies the condition `num != 0`.

State: **`a` is 0, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5**
