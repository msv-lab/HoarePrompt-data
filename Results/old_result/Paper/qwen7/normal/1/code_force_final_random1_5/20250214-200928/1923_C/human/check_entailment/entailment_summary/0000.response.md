Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Condition 1**: The sum of elements in the subarray should be equal to the sum of elements in the corresponding array \( b \).
2. **Condition 2**: All elements in the subarray must be different from the corresponding elements in \( b \).
3. **Condition 3**: All elements in \( b \) must be greater than 0.

The program attempts to check the sum of the subarray and the count of 1s in the subarray but does not ensure that the subarray can be transformed into an array \( b \) where all elements are different and greater than 0. Specifically, the program does not verify if the sum of the subarray can be split into positive integers that are all different from each other.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Calculate the sum of the subarray.
- Check if the sum can be partitioned into distinct positive integers.
- Ensure that the subarray has at least two elements (since a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the conditions).

The current implementation only checks the sum and the count of 1s, which is insufficient to determine if the subarray is "good".

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
