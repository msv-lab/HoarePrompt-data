Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with one instance of `char` replaced by `unique_chars[j-1]`, `char` is a character, and `unique_chars` is a set containing unique characters.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` now points to the previous element in the set `unique_chars`. The string `s` and the set `unique_chars` remain unchanged from their initial state.
