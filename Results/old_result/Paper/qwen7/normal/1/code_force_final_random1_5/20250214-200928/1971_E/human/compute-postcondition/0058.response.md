Output State: **`m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is len(a), `i` is 1, `s` is bisect_left(a, ql), `ql` is an input integer - a[s - 1], `l` is 1**.

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` to its current value (`b[s - 1]`). All other variables remain unchanged.
