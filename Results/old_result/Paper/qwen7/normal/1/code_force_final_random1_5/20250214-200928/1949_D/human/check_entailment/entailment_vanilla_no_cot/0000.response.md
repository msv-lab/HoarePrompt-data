Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Transition Video Decisions:**
   - The logic for deciding whether a `?` should be replaced with `F` or `S` is flawed. The current implementation tries to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type appear for any permutation of scenarios. However, the logic used to decide `F` or `S` for `?` values is not sufficient to guarantee this constraint for all permutations.

2. **Incomplete Consideration of Constraints:**
   - The program does not fully consider the constraint that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type should appear consecutively for any permutation of scenarios. The current approach only ensures this for a subset of permutations and does not handle all possible permutations correctly.

3. **Incorrect Use of Lists and Variables:**
   - The use of lists `a` and `b` to count the number of `F` and `S` transitions is not necessary and complicates the logic unnecessarily. The program should directly handle the `?` values and ensure the constraints are met without relying on these additional variables.

4. **Lack of Proper Logic for Ensuring Constraint Satisfaction:**
   - The program does not have a proper mechanism to ensure that the generated solution satisfies the constraint for all possible permutations of scenarios. This is a critical requirement of the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated algorithm is needed that can handle all permutations and ensure the constraint is satisfied. The current implementation does not meet these requirements and thus is incorrect.
