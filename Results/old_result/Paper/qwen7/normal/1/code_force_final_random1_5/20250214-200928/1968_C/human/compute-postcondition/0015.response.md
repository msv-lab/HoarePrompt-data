Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0] + x[0] + a[1] + x[1] + ... + a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to the original value of `n`. The value of `a[i]` is also unchanged and is still equal to the sum of `a[0] + x[0] + a[1] + x[1] + ... + a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.
