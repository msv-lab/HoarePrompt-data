Output State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, `c1` is the value of `o * 100 // n`.**

The code `c1 = o * 100 // n` calculates the integer division of `o * 100` by `n` and assigns the result to `c1`. Since `o` and `n` are not defined in the initial state, `c1` is calculated based on these values. The other variables (`pk`, `mini`, and `final`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
