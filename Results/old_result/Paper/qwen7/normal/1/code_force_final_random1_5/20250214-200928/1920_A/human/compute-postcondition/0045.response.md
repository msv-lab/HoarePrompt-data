Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`, and `num` is a list containing `[v]`**.

The code `start = v` assigns the value of `v` to the variable `start`. Since `v` is an input integer, the value of `start` is now the same as `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
