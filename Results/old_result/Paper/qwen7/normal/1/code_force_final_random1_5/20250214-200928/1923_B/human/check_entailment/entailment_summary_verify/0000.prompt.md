You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        rest = k
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        distance += 1
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n and k, followed by lists a and x. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the scenario where multiple monsters can be at the same distance from the player simultaneously. Here’s a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 1 1
-1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, we need to check if we can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's position (0).

Using the provided `func_1` function, the execution would be as follows:

1. Sort the indices based on the absolute distance from the player:
   - Distance for monster at -1 is 1.
   - Distance for monster at 1 is 1.
   - Sorted indices: [0, 1].

2. Start processing the sorted indices:
   - At distance 1, both monsters are present. The function checks if the distance is already covered (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`). Since `distance` is 0 initially, this condition fails, and the function returns `False`.

However, according to the problem description, we should be able to kill both monsters in one second since we have 2 bullets and both monsters are at the same distance. The correct approach would be to handle the case where multiple monsters are at the same distance and ensure that all of them are killed before moving on to the next distance.

Therefore, the provided function does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple monsters are at the same distance, leading to incorrect results. Hence, the program is incorrect.
