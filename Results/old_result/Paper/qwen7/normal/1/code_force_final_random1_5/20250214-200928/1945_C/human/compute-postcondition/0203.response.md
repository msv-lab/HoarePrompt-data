Postcondition: `zero_perc` is updated to either `zero * 100 // (i + 3)` if `s[i] == '0'` or `zero * 100 // (i + 2)` if `s[i] != '0'`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 2)`, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged, `c1` remains unchanged, `t` is `t-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `sl` remains unchanged, `o` remains unchanged, `z` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] == '0'` or remains unchanged if `s[i] != '0'`, `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i] != '0'` or remains unchanged if `s[i] == '0'`, and `lst` remains as it was before the if statement.
