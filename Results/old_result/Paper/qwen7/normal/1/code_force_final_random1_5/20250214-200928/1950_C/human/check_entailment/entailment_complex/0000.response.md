Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. For hours between 00 and 11, it correctly prints the hour as is.
3. For hours between 12 and 23, it correctly adjusts the hour to the 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" accordingly.
4. The function processes each test case as expected and prints the result in the required format.
5. There are no logical errors in the code that would cause incorrect outputs based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
