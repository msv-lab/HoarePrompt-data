Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is [0] and sorted, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the integer `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `0`, it becomes `[0]`. All other variables (`lst`, `mini`, `c1`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition about `c1` being greater than or equal to 50 also remains valid.
