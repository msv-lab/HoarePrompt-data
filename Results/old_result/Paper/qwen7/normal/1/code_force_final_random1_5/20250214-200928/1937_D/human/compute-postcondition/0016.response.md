Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n`.
   - `A` is a list containing `[0, i]`.
   - `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that the character at index `i` in string `s` is `'>'.`

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, the character at index `2` in string `s` must be `'>'.` If it is, then the loop will continue.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `A` will be updated to include the new value of `i`, so `A` will be `[0, 2]`.
   - `idx_A` will be updated to include the new value of `i`, so `idx_A` will be `[0, 2]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` remains a string of length `n`.
   - `A` becomes `[0, 2]`.
   - `idx_A` becomes `[0, 2]`.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that the character at index `2` in string `s` is `'>'.`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, 2]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0, 2]`, and `i` is 2.**
