Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: According to the given state right before the loop, `i` is equal to the length of the list `a` + 1.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute the first time**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since `i` is currently `len(a) + 1`, it is not less than `len(a)`. To make the loop execute the first time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(a)`. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `len(a)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index, and `new2[i-1]` is updated to be the minimum value of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`**.
