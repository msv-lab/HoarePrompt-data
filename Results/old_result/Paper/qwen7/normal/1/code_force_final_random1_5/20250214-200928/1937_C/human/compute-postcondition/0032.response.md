Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to its original value, but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', and since `res` is currently '<', `k` would be the last value of `i` that made `res` '<'. Given that `i` is now 2, and assuming this is the first time `res` is set to '<' with `i` being 2, `k` should be 1.
- `res` is explicitly given as '<'.

So, the print statement `print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)` will output the following:

Output: **? 1 1 1 2**
