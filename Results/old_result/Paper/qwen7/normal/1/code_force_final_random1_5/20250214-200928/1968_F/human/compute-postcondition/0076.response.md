Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 4; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'NO'; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect.bisect_left).**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This changes the content of `results` from possibly containing `'YES'` to now containing `'NO'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state provided.
