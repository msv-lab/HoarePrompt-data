Output State: **`impossible` is False, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `impossible` to `False`. This does not affect any other variables. The conditions and values of `ans`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `gr[2][0] != gr[3][0] or gr[2][m - 1] != gr[3][m - 1]` also remains valid as no changes were made to the `gr` list.
