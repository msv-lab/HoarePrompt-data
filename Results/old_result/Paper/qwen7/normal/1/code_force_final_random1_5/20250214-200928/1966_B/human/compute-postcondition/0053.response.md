Postcondition: **`impossible` is True, `ans` is 'NO', `n` is greater than 2, and for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds true.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `impossible` remains `True`, indicating that the conditions within the if statement were met. The value of `ans` remains `'NO'`, and the size of the grid `n` must still be greater than 2. Additionally, for each pair of consecutive rows in the grid (from the first row to the second-to-last row), at least one of the first elements or the last elements of these rows must be different.
