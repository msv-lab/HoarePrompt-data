Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
   - `j` is 0
   - `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`
   - `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`
   - `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself
   - `n` is equal to `t`
   - `i` is 0
   - `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration
   - `sm` is the maximum of `suf[0] - smin[0]` and `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains unchanged if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop runs until `i` is less than `n + 1`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Update the States**:
   - `t` remains greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `j` remains 0.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `l` remains the same.
   - `suf` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` changes to 1.
   - `smin` needs to be updated according to the new value of `i`.
   - `sm` needs to be updated based on the new value of `i`.

5. **State After the Next Iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
   - `j` is 0
   - `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`
   - `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`
   - `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself
   - `n` is equal to `t`
   - `i` is 1
   - `smin` is updated to include the minimum value between `suf[2]` and the last element of `smin` (since `i` is now 1, `smin[1]` will be the minimum of `suf[2]` and `smin[1]`).
   - `sm` is updated based on the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `smin` is updated to include the minimum value between `suf[2]` and the last element of `smin`, `sm` is updated based on the new value of `i`**
