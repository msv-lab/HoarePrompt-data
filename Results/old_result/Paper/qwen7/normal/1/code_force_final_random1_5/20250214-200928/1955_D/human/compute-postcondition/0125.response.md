Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing the unique elements of `b` from index 0 to `m-1`, `i` is `m - 1`, `curr` is the sum of counts of each element in `b` up to index `m-1`, `ans` is 0, and `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. All other variables (`b_values`, `i`, `curr`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
