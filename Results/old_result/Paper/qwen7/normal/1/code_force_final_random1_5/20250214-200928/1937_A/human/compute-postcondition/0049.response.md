Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `power` is 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code sets `power` to 1. This changes the value of `power` from either `n_cases` or `power - 1` to 1. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
