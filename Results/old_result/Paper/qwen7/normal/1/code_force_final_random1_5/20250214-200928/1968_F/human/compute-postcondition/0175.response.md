Postcondition: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 7, `l` is int(data[idx]), `r` is int(data[idx + 1]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `results` is appended with 'YES' if `x == 0` and the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is satisfied, otherwise `results` remains unchanged, and `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**
