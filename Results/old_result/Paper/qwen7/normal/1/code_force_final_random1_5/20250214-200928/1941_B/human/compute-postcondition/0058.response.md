Based on the initial state provided:

- `stop` is `False`
- `i` is equal to `n - 3`
- `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`
- `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`
- `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `opNum`
- The current value of `a[i]` is less than 0

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
