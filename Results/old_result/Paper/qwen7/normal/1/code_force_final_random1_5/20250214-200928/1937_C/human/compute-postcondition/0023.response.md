Output State: **`best` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' (or 1 if `res` was never '<'), and `res` is the final input string received.**

Explanation: The line `best = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `best`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, or `res` from their previous states. Therefore, the output state retains the conditions specified in the initial state, with `best` now explicitly set to 0.
