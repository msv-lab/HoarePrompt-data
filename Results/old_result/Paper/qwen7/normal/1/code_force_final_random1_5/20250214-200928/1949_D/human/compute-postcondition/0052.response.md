Postcondition: **`j` must be between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1 and `b[i]` is increased by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then no changes are made to `a[j]`, `b[j]`, and `b[i]`.**
