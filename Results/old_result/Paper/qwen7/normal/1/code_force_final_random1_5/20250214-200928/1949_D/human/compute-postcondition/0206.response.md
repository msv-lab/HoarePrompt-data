Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `nx` is 'FF', `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Given that `nx` was either equal to `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` was not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if `xx[i][j - 1]` was '?', and knowing that `j` is 2 (so `xx[i][j - 1]` refers to `xx[i][1]`), `nx` was initially 'F'. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'FF'. All other variables remain unchanged.
