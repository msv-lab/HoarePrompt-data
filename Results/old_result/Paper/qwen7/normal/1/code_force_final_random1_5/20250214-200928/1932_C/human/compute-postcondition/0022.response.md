Output State: **`i` is 2; `l` is either 2 or 3; `b` contains `a[l-1]` appended to its current value; `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3**.

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was either 1 or 2 initially, after incrementing, `l` will now be either 2 or 3. The other variables (`i`, `b`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
