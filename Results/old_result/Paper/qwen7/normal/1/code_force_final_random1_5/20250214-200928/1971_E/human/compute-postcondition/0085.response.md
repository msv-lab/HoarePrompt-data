Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` in the range function `range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ad` is a list with one additional element which is the difference between `a[k + 1]` and `a[k]`.
   - `a` retains its previous values.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(a) - 1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`.
   - The list `ad` and the list `a` remain unchanged as per the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `ad` remains the same, with one additional element which is the difference between `a[k + 2]` and `a[k + 1]`.
- `a` retains its previous values.
- `i` becomes `k + 2`.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`ad` is a list with one additional element which is the difference between `a[k + 2]` and `a[k + 1]`, `a` retains its previous values, `i` is `k + 2`**.
