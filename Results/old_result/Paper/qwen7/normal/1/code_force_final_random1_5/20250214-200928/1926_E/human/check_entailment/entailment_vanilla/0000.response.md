Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Building the List of Counts**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `L`.
   - It enters a loop where it calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2` and subtracts `m` from `n`.
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes zero.
   - The purpose of this loop is to determine how many cards will be laid down at each step (based on the multiples of odd numbers).

3. **Calculating the k-th Card**:
   - The program initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - It iterates over the list `L` and checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - It updates `tot` by adding `a` to it and multiplies `pow` by 2 for the next iteration.
