Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and now includes `suf[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is equal to `t + 1`, the new value of `smin` is updated to include `suf[t + 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
