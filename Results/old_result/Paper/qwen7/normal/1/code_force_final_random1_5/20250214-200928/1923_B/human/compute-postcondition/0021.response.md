Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is 1, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now equal to `x[sorted_indices[pos]] - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**.

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` subtracts `delta` from `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Given that `delta` is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated to `x[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
