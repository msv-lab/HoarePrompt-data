Output State: **`rest` is `k`, `distance`, `pos`, `rest`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `rest = k` assigns the value of `k` to the variable `rest`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `distance`, `pos`, `rest`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged from their initial state.
