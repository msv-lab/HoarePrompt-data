Output State: `t` is 0 and `func_1()` has been called 3 times.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop runs for `t` times and once `t` becomes 0, the loop terminates. Additionally, since the loop calls `func_1()` in each iteration, it will have been called 3 times by the end of the loop's execution.
