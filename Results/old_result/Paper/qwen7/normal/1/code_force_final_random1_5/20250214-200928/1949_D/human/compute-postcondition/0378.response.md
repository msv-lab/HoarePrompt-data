Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `xx` contains `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are lists where `a[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'F' at the `j-th` position across all inputs and `b[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'S' at the `j-th` position across all inputs, `sa` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition `a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition `b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` (or `n-1` if the else part is executed) consisting of characters 'F' and 'S'. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, then for each `j` from 1 to `n`, if `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx[j-1]` is equal to `xx[i][j-1]`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then `nx[j-1]` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n//4]`), otherwise `nx[j-1]` is 'S'. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, then `nx` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'S' and 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `n` is the same as after the last iteration of the loop.**
