The loop condition in this case is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 0. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `n` must be adjusted to a non-zero value.

State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 32, `m` is 1, `n` must be non-zero**
