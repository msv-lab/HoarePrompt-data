Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and processes each test case by reading the number of people in front of Kirill (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`). This part is handled correctly.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the allowed range (`pos_final`). It iterates from the last person in the queue to the first, updating the total cost and keeping track of the best cost found so far. The logic for updating the total cost and the best cost is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles the boundary conditions correctly. It ensures that if Kirill needs to move to a position within the allowed range, it uses the cost `a_i` and updates the best cost accordingly. If moving to a position outside the allowed range, it uses the cost `b_i`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
