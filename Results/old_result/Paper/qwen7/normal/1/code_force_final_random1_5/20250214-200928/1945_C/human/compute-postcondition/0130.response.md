Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `one` is 3, `one_perc` is -200, `zero_perc` is 0, and `lst` is [4]. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then the list `lst` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.
