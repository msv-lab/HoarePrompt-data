Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `a`; for every index `j` where `0 <= j < len(a)`, `new[j]` is equal to `max(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` is equal to `min(a[j], b[j])`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the length of the list `a`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements. For each index `j` in the range from 0 to the length of `a` (exclusive), the corresponding values in `new` and `new2` lists will be set to the maximum and minimum of the elements at the same index in `a` and `b` lists, respectively.
