Based on the initial state provided and the update rules, let's determine the values of the variables `n` and `i` at the start of the next iteration before the `print` statement is executed.

From the precondition:
- `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `r` is decreased by 1.

Let's assume the values at the end of the previous iteration were:
- `i = 2`
- `n = 5`
- `r = 4`

After the updates:
- `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`
- `n` remains `5`
- `r` will be `4 - 1 = 3`

So, at the start of the next iteration, the values are:
- `i = 3`
- `n = 5`
- `r = 3`

Now, the `print` statement is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

Substituting the values of `n` and `i`:
- `n - i = 5 - 3 = 2`

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **2**
