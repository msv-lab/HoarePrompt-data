Output State: **`new2[i]` is set to the maximum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new` array has its `(i+1)`-th element updated to be the minimum between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new[i]` is now the minimum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `i` is now `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`, while the conditions and values of `new2[i]`, `new`, and `new[i]` remain as specified in the initial state.
