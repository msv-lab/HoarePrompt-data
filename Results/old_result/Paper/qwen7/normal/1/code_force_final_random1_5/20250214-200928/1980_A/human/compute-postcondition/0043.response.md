Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, the function calculates the missing values, which are the sums of the maximum of 0 and the differences between `m` and each frequency count in `freq` (a list of frequencies derived from the string `a`). The function returns a list of these calculated missing values for all test cases.**
