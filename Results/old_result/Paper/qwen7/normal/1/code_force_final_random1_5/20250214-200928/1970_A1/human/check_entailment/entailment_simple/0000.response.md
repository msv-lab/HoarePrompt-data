Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the `BalanceInfo` class with the required attributes (`balance`, `position`, and `character`).
2. The `func_2` function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, where each object represents the balance of parentheses up to that point in the string and the position of the character.
3. The `balance_info` list is sorted according to the rules specified in the problem statement: first by `balance` in ascending order, and then by `position` in descending order for ties.
4. Finally, the program constructs the balanced shuffle by concatenating the `character` attributes of the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints the result.

Given the provided annotated program and the steps described, the program appears to follow the correct logic for performing the balanced shuffle operation as defined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
