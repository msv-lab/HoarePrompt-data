Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `alp` is a list containing the alphabet characters from 'a' to 'z'.**

The code initializes the list `alp` with the alphabet characters from 'a' to 'z'. This does not affect the values of `t`, `l`, or `array`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
