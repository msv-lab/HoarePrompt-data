Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `ad` has its last element updated to `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` (which means `i` will be `i + 2` if we consider the current value of `i` as `i + 1`).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `1 <= i < len(a)`. Therefore, `i` must still satisfy this condition.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `ad` remains unchanged because the update happens inside the loop body, and we are only concerned with the loop head variables.
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` from the previous state.

Given that `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ad` has its last element updated to `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, and `i` is `i + 2`**.
