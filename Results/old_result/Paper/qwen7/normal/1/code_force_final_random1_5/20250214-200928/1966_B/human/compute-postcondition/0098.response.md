Output State: **`impossible` is `False`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is greater than 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `impossible`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `j`, `m`, `n`, and `i` as they were initially, while `impossible` is explicitly set to `False`.
