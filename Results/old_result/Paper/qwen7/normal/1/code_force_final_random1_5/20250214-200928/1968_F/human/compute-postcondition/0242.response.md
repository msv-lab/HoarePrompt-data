Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `l` is `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`**

Explanation: Initially, `idx` was incremented by 2, making `idx` equal to `idx + 2`. Then, the code `idx += 2` increments `idx` by another 2, making `idx` equal to `idx + 4`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged as they are dependent on the original value of `idx` before the second increment. Therefore, `l` is still `data[idx - 2]` and `r` is still `int(data[idx - 1])`.
