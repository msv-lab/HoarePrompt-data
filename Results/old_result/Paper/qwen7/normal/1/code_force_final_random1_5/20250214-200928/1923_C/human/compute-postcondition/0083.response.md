Output State: `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of all 1's in `l`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of `l`, starting from 0, and `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l`, starting from 0.

In more detail, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- `i` will be the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `j` will be the count of all 1's in `l`.
- `p` will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of `l` up to that point, starting with 0.
- `c` will be a list where each element represents the count of 1's encountered up to that point in `l`.
