Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, `j` is `m + 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `n` is an integer greater than `m + 1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

In this code snippet, `d1[2]` is assigned the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
