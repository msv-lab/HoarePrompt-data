You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of t test cases, each test case starts with an integer n followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, with the size of the triangle or square being greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed (which is equal to `a`), `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's in the binary representation of all integers provided as input through the loop, and `b` is the most recent input string from the user. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the program prints 'SQUARE'. If the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, the program prints 'TRIANGLE'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a grid of n x n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. For each test case, the function determines whether the shape is a triangle or a square and returns the type of the shape for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
