Output State: **`lst` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the first element of `lst`, `mini` is the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem`, `final` now contains the first element of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code appends the first element of `lst` (which is `elem`) to the list `final`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
