Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and the range is defined as `range(1, len(lis))`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 1 because the range is specified as `range(1, len(lis))`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `len(lis)` must be at least 2. This is because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `len(lis)`. Therefore, if `len(lis)` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `len(lis)` is at least 2. Additionally, since `j` starts at 1, no adjustment is needed for `j` itself.

5. **Consider other given states**: The states of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `test` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `len(lis)` must be at least 2.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True**
