Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p` is a list of integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer. The input is split and each element is converted to an integer and then adjusted to the nearest even number.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `p`:**
   - Each element in `p` is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer. This means if the input integer is odd, it will be rounded up to the next even number; if it is even, it remains the same.

2. **First Part of the Expression:**
   - `list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))` creates a list of booleans indicating whether the first three elements of `p` are odd.
   - `sum(...)` sums these boolean values. If all three elements are odd, the sum will be 3. Otherwise, it will be less than 3.

3. **Second Part of the Expression:**
   - `sum(p)` calculates the sum of all elements in `p`.
   - `sum(p) // 2` divides this sum by 2 and performs integer division, resulting in the floor division of the sum by 2.

4. **Combining Both Parts:**
   - The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` checks if the first three elements of `p` are all odd and adds the result of the integer division of the sum of `p` by 2.

### Possible Scenarios:

- **Scenario 1: All First Three Elements of `p` are Odd:**
  - If the first three elements of `p` are all odd, `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` will be 3.
  - The expression becomes `3 + sum(p) // 2`.

- **Scenario 2: Not All First Three Elements of `p` are Odd:**
  - If not all first three elements of `p` are odd, `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` will be less than 3.
  - The expression becomes `0 + sum(p) // 2`.

### Conclusion:

Given the nature of the problem, let's assume the simplest case where the first three elements of `p` are all odd (as this is the most straightforward scenario to illustrate):

- Let's say `p = [2, 4, 6, 8]` (for simplicity, but any set of integers will work as long as the first three are odd).

- The first three elements of `p` are `[2, 4, 6]`, which are all even. So, `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` will be 0.

- The sum of `p` is `2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20`, and `20 // 2 = 10`.

- Therefore, the expression evaluates to `0 + 10 = 10`.

Output: **10**
