Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` subtracts `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`. Given the initial state, `opNum` is `a[i]`, so `a[i + 2]` is updated to `a[i + 2] - opNum`, which is equivalent to `a[i + 2] - a[i]`. Since the other variables (`stop`, `i`, `opNum`, `a[i]`, and `a[i + 1]`) are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes the updated value of `a[i + 2]` as `a[i + 2] - a[i]`, which is `a[i + 2] - opNum`.
