Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. This means the state of `int(input())` must be such that the loop can proceed.

3. **Analyze the given initial states**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a` is the integer input for the first test case.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `int(input())`, the state of `int(input())` must be such that the loop can execute. This means the input must be a valid integer.
   - Given that `a` is the integer input for the first test case, `int(input())` should be equal to `a`.

5. **Combine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The state `a` being greater than 0 ensures that the input will be a positive integer.
   - Therefore, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, specifically `a`.

So, the final state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is the integer input for the first test case and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, and `int(input())` must be equal to `a`**.
