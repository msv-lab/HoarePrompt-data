### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies issues with the given program. Let's break down the problems and verify the solution using the provided annotations and the corrected version.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`:**
   - The original program incorrectly updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` instead of finding the actual MEX for the prefix of \( p \).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Permutation:**
   - The program constructs the permutation \( p \) by directly calculating `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, which is not a valid approach to solve the problem.

#### Corrected Version Analysis

The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses these issues:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The permutation \( p \) is initialized with values from 0 to \( n-1 \).

2. **Calculation of MEX:**
   - For each index \( i \), it calculates the MEX for the prefix of \( p \) by incrementing `mex` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix.

3. **Validation:**
   - It ensures that the calculated MEX matches the corresponding value in \( a \).

4. **Construction of Permutation:**
   - The permutation \( p \) is updated based on the calculated MEX.

This approach ensures that the permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

#### Verification Using Annotated Code

The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the program's state after each iteration:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n` is the length of the permutation and array \( a \).
  - `ar` is the array \( a \).
  - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values of length \( n \).
  - `mex` is initialized to \( n \).

- **Backward Iteration:**
  - The loop iterates backward through the array \( a \).
  - For each index \( i \), it calculates the MEX for the prefix of \( p \) and ensures it matches the corresponding value in \( a \).

- **Output:**
  - The result is printed as a space-separated string.

### Conclusion

The corrected version of the program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given condition. The original assessment accurately identified the issues with the given program and provided a correct solution.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
