Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:`
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is 1
  - `new2[0]` is equal to `min(a[0], b[0])`
  - `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`

### Loop Head Variables:
- The loop head involves two conditions: `i < len(a)` and `a[i] == b[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i < len(a)`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 (or higher) to satisfy this condition.

2. **Condition 2: `a[i] == b[i]`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - We need to check the values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`.
   - Since `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`, let's denote this common value as `x`.
   - The values of `a[1]` and `b[1]` are not specified directly, but they must be equal for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`.

### Adjusted States:
- To ensure the loop continues, `i` must be incremented to 2.
- `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`**
