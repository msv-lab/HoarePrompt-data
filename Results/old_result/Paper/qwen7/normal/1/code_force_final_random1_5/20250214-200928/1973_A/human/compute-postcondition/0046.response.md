Output State: **`p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `egalites` is updated to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1, -1` if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`.**

Explanation: The code appends `-1` to the `resultats` list. Since `resultats` was initially a list containing `-1, -1`, after appending `-1`, it becomes `-1, -1, -1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
