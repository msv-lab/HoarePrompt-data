### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's re-evaluate this conclusion using the function summary and the problem description.

#### Function Summary Recap
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a result based on `n` and `m` using a specific algorithm involving a loop and arithmetic operations. The function prints the calculated result for each test case and returns nothing.

#### Problem Description Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Code Analysis
The given code initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It then iterates from `count` to `m` and updates `ans` based on some arithmetic operations. However, these operations do not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Count the number of valid pairs.

#### Example Verification
Let's verify the given code with the example provided:

- For the input `(10, 8)`, the expected output is `14`.

Given the code's current implementation, it does not correctly count the valid pairs. We need to ensure that the code checks the condition accurately.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The given code does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the final evaluation remains:

**Final: False**
