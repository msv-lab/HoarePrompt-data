Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `na_frente` to `-1` in reverse order (decrementing by 1 each time).

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `na_frente` is an input integer minus 1.
   - `v` is `na_frente`.
   - `c` is 2 (not relevant for this loop).
   - `v` is -1 minus the length of `custo_pra_frente`.
   - `total` is updated based on certain conditions.
   - `best` is set to a new value if certain conditions are met.
   - `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if another condition is met.
   - `best` remains 10000000000 if `v > pos_final`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `v` by 1, the new value of `v` will be `v - 1`.
   - The new value of `na_frente` will remain the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `v` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `v` will be `v - 1` from the previous value.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged.
   - `c` remains 2 (unchanged).
   - `total` and `best` are not directly affected by the loop head but by the loop body, so they remain as they are unless the loop body updates them.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `v` is `v - 1`.
- `na_frente` remains the same.
- `c` remains 2.
- `total` and `best` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is `v - 1`, `c` is 2, `total` is updated based on the previous iteration, `best` remains 10000000000 if `v > pos_final`**.

To simplify the answer:

State: **`na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is `v - 1`, `c` is 2, `total` is updated based on the previous iteration, `best` remains 10000000000 if `v > pos_final`**.
