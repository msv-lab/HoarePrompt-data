Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n // 2 - 1`, and if the current value of `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 1. So, `g` becomes `n // 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
