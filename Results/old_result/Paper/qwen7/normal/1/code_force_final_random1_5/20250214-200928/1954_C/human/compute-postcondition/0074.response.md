Output State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `new2[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `new[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that `i` was initially `len(a) - 2`, after executing the code, `i` becomes `len(a) - 1`. The values of `new2[i]` and `new[i]` remain unchanged as they were previously set based on the conditions involving `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
