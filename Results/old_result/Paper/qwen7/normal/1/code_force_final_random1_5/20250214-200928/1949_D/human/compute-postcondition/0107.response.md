Output State: **`xx` now contains the list `[x]`, all other variables and lists (`i`, `j`, `xx`, `x`, `a`, `b`) retain their values as they were after the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The line `xx.append(x)` appends the current value of `x` to the list `xx`. Since `xx` was empty before this line, after appending `x`, `xx` will contain `[x]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged from their values after the last iteration of the loop.
