Based on the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to determine the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` after all iterations of the loop have completed. However, the initial state does not explicitly provide these values. Therefore, we will describe the output in terms of the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not specified in the initial state, we will represent them as placeholders.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]]**
