Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `ans` contains the value of `tem` appended to it**

Explanation: The code multiplies `tem` by `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is initially `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is updated to `tem * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
