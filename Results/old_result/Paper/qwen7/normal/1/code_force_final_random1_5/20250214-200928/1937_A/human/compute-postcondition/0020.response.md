Given the initial state:
- `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is `log2(n_cases)` and must be greater than 2.
- `power` is 3.

We need to determine the value of `2 ** power` and print it.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `power` is explicitly given as 3, we know the value of `power` is 3.
2. We need to calculate `2 ** power`, which is `2 ** 3`.
3. `2 ** 3` equals 8.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value 8.

Output: **8**
