Output State: **`freq' is updated such that the element at index (ord(prob) - ord('A')) is incremented by 1.** 

This means that the frequency count for the character `prob` (converted to its ASCII index relative to 'A') in the list `freq` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
