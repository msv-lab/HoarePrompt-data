Output State: **`l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing one element which is `a[r]`, `r` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is not 'L'**.

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. Since `r` is `n - 1`, `b` now contains one element, which is `a[n - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
