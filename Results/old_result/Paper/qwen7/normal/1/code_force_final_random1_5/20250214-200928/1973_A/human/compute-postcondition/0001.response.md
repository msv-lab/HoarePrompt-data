Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` which is being assigned values from the `cas_de_test` list. Therefore, the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and the list `cas_de_test` are the ones that need to be considered.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, the list `cas_de_test` must contain at least one element. Each element in `cas_de_test` is a list containing three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` that satisfy the condition `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 and is not directly involved in the loop head, its value does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the `cas_de_test` list must contain at least one valid triplet `(p1, p2, p3)`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the `cas_de_test` list must contain at least one valid triplet.

**Final State:**
State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists that must contain at least one list [p1, p2, p3] where 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30**, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `resultats` is an empty list.
