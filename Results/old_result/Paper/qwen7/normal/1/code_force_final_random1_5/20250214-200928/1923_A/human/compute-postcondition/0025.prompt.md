You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration; `arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces for each iteration; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` for the last iteration; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]` for the last iteration; `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y` for the last iteration; `_` is `t-1` (indicating the loop has completed `t-1` iterations); `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` for the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within the range 1 to 1000, `n` will be the integer input for the last iteration, `arr` will be the string for the last iteration, `x` will be the index of the first '1' in `arr` from the last iteration, `y` will be the index of the first '1' from the end in `arr` from the last iteration, `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n-y` from the last iteration, `_` will indicate the loop has run `t-1` times, and `x` will be the index of the first '1' in `arr` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) where each integer is either 0 or 1. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
