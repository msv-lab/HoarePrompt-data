Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies an input through its constraints: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. It returns either an integer or a specific value based on the input list `a`.**

This means the function `func_3` does not explicitly take any parameters when called, but it works with an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers as implied by its constraints. The function then processes this list `a` and returns a result, which could be an integer or a specific value depending on the logic implemented within the function.
