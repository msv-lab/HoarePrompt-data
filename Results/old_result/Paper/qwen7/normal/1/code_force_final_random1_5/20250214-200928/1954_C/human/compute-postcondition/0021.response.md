Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index, and `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index. The current value of `i` is still equal to the length of the list `a`.**
