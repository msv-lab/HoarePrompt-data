Output State: **`j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, `impossible` is True if both `gr[0][m-2]` is equal to `gr[0][m-1]` and `gr[n-1][m-2]` is equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, and `ans` is 'NO'**.

Explanation: The line `ans = 'NO'` assigns the string 'NO' to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `m`, `impossible`, or the conditions related to the matrix `gr`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged from their initial state.
