Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by 6, `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by 3, `u2vs[u]` is a list containing `u`, `u`, and `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`. Initially, `u2vs[u]` contains only `u` and `u`. After appending `v`, `u2vs[u]` now contains `u`, `u`, and `v`. The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` are updated according to their definitions, and the precondition that `n` must be at least 4 remains unchanged.
