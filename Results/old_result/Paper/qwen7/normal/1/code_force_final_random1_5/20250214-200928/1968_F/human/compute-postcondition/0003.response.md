Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings, `n` and `q` are not yet defined as integers, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, and each query consists of l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 1, so after executing the code, `idx` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged.
