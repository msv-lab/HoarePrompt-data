Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is set to `i + 1` if `i` was not 0. This means `i` is either 1 (if it was 0 initially) or `i + 1` (if `i` was already something else).
   - `n` must be greater than 0. So, `n` is a positive integer.
   - `r` is decreased by 1. This implies that `r` had a previous value, but we don't know what it was initially.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The expression being printed is `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.
   - We need to determine the values of `n`, `i`, and `idx_A[l - 1]`.

Given the information, let's assume the simplest case where `i` was 0 initially (since it's the only clear value from the precondition):

- If `i` was 0, then `i` becomes 1 after the update.
- `n` is a positive integer, so let's denote it as `n`.
- `idx_A[l - 1]` is an element from the list `idx_A` at index `l - 1`. Since no specific value for `idx_A` or `l` is provided, we cannot determine this value precisely.

Since we don't have specific values for `n` and `idx_A[l - 1]`, we'll express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - 1 + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2**
