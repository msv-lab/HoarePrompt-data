Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know that `n_cases` must be greater than 4.
2. `n` is defined as `log2(n_cases)`, and it must be greater than 2.
3. `power` is explicitly set to 4.
4. It is also mentioned that `power` is equal to `n`.

Given these conditions, let's determine the value of `n`:

- Since `n` is `log2(n_cases)` and it must be greater than 2, `n_cases` must be greater than \(2^2 = 4\). This aligns with the initial condition that `n_cases` must be greater than 4.
- Therefore, `n` is indeed `log2(n_cases)`, and since `n` must be greater than 2, `n_cases` could be any number greater than 4, but the specific value of `n` is not needed to solve the problem.
- We are also given that `power` is explicitly set to 4, and it is equal to `n`.

Now, the print statement is `print(2 ** power)`. Given that `power` is 4, this statement will print \(2^4\).

Output: **16**
