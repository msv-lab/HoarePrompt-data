Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `len(lis) - 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within this range.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `l` is a map object created from integers split from input.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `test` is False.
   - The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j-1]` in the list `lis` is either greater than 1 or `j` is an odd number.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `j` is less than `len(lis)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `len(lis) - 1`, the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration must be less than `len(lis)`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Therefore, `j` should be set to `j + 1`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than `len(lis)`.
   - If `j` is equal to `len(lis)`, the loop will stop.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `l` is a map object created from integers split from input (unchanged).
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements (unchanged).
- `test` is False (unchanged).
- The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j-1]` in the list `lis` is either greater than 1 or `j` is an odd number (unchanged).
- `j` is set to `j + 1` and must be less than `len(lis)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is False, the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j-1]` in the list `lis` is either greater than 1 or `j` is an odd number, and `j` is less than `len(lis)`**
