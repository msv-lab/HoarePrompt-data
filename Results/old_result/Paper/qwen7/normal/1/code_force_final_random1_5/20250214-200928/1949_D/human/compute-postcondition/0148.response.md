Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `sa` contains `i + 1`, `a[i + 1]` is 0 and `b[i + 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Since `i` is initially `i + 1`, appending `i` to `sa` means `sa` now contains `i + 1`. The values of `a[i + 1]` and `b[i + 1]` remain 0 as specified in the initial state.
