Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is in the range from 1 to n/4, `j` is in the range from 1 to n/4, and `xx[i][j-1]` is '?'.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the value of `xx[i][j-1]` also remains unchanged and is still '?'.
