Postcondition: `c` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is adjusted from its initial value as `k - (n - 1) + 1`. If `k < i - 1`, the function returns the result of the function call `func_2(2, k, l)`, where `l` is not defined, hence the function's postcondition remains unchanged.
