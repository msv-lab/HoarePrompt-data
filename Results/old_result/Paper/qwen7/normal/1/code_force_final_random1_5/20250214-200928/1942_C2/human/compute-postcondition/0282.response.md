Postcondition: `i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is an odd number greater than 1, otherwise it is an empty list, `even` is a list containing `gap` if `gap` is an even number greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, otherwise it is an empty list, `x` must be greater than 0, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
