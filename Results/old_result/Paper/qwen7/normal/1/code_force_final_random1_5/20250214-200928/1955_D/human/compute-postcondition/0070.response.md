Output State: **`i` is 1; `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is decreased by 1; `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. Since `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
