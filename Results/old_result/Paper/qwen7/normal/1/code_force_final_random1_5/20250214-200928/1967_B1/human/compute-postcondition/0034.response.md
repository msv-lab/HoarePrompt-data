Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n` + `sum(int(g / count) + 1 for count in range(2, m + 1))`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `count` will be equal to `m + 1`. The variable `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `int(g / count) + 1` for each `count` from 2 to `m + 1`. The variable `countmins` will be `m - 1`, and `g` will be `int(n / (m + 1)) - m`.
