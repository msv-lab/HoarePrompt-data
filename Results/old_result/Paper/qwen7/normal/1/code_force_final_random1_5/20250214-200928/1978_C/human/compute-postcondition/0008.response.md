Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It first calls `func_1(n, k)` with parameters `n` and `k`, where both are integers and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5} and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. Then it calls `func_5` with the result of `func_1(n, k)` as its argument. Finally, it returns the value of `l`, which is the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))`.**
