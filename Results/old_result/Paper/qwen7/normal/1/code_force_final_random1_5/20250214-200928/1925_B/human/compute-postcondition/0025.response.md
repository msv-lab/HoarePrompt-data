Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. The value of `i` remains `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. The initial value of `x` does not change.
