Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n` (between 3 and 200,000), and three integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (each between 1 and `n-2` and summing up to `n`). It also takes a list of `n` positive integers named `numbers`. The function first sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the numbers into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) based on their size requirements. After distribution, it checks if the sums of the three groups satisfy a certain condition using `func_1`. If the condition is met, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
