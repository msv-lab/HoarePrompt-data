Output State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l` (if it exists), `i` is increased by 2, `j` is increased by 2, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j`**.

This means that the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to the original value of `j` plus 1. Since the initial state already mentioned that `j` was increased by 1, the new value of `j` is now increased by 2. Similarly, `i` was initially increased by 1, and now it is increased by another 1, making it increased by 2 in total. All other variables remain in their respective states from the initial condition.
