Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `B` is a list containing 0 if `idx_B` was empty, otherwise `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is updated to `n - 1 - j`. Given the initial state where `j` is 2 and `i` is `n - 3`, after executing the code, `i` becomes `n - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 3 - 1` or `n - 4`. The values of `j`, `idx_B`, and `B` remain unchanged from their initial states.
