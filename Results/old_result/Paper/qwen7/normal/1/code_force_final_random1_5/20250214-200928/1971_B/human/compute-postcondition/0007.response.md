Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `s` is an input string.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`.
- The length of `a` is not equal to 2.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.
