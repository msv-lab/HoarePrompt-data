Output State: **`j` is between 2 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[j]` is incremented by 1**

The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Since `j` is between 2 and `n` inclusive and `n` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
