Output State: The value of `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration; `arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` for the final iteration; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]` for the final iteration; `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y` for the final iteration; `_` is `t-1`; `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` for the final iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total number of inputs provided, `n` will be the last input integer, `arr` will be the last input string processed, `x` will be the index of the first '1' in the final `arr`, `y` will be the index of the first '1' from the end in the reversed `arr`, `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n-y` in the final `arr`, `_` will be `t-1` indicating the loop has completed `t-1` iterations, and `x` will be updated to the index of the first '1' in the final `arr`.
