Postcondition: `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `current`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now includes `neighbor`, and `queue` now contains `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. If `neighbor` is in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` and `queue`.
