Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains greater than `m+1`, `d1[n]` is determined based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, `d2[n-1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i=1` to `i=n-2`, updating the value of `d1[i+2]` based on the conditions provided.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`.
- `n` remains greater than `m+1` as no changes are made to `n` or `m` in the given code.
- `d1[n]` is determined by the loop's logic, which updates `d1[i+2]` based on the differences in the list `l`.
- `d2[n-1]` is explicitly set to 1 outside the loop.
