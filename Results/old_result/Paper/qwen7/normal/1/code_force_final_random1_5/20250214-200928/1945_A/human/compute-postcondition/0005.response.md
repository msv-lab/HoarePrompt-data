Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is the first part of the split string, `c` is the third part of the split string, `s` is the next line in the input, `b` is updated to `b + c`, `a` and `c` are integers derived from splitting the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` into parts using whitespace as the delimiter and converts each part to an integer. The first part of the split string is assigned to `a`, the second part to `b`, and the third part to `c`. The value of `b` is updated to be the original value of `b` plus `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.
