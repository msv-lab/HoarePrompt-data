Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and passes it to the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples containing the balance, position, and character at each index of the input string.

2. **Computing Prefix Balances:**
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the balance and appends a tuple `(balance, position, character)` to `prefix_balance`.
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.

3. **Sorting the Prefix Balances:**
   - The `prefix_balance` list is sorted using a key that sorts by prefix balance in ascending order and by position in descending order in case of ties.
   - The sorting ensures that the resulting sequence will have the required properties of the balanced shuffle.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - After sorting, the function constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted tuples and concatenating them.

5. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns the constructed result string.

### Verification Against the Problem Description

- **Balanced Parentheses Sequence:** The input is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, so the initial balance will always start at 0 and end at 0.
- **Non-Negative Balance for Prefixes:** The sorting ensures that each prefix of the resulting sequence has a non-negative balance.
- **Correct Order of Characters:** The sorting logic ensures that the characters are placed in the correct order to form the balanced shuffle.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

**Correctness: True**
