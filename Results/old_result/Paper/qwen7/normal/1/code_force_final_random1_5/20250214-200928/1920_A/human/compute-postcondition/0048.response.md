Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`, and `num` is a list containing `[v]`. Since the if condition `t == 1` does not change the values of the variables and there is no else part, the conditions remain unchanged.
