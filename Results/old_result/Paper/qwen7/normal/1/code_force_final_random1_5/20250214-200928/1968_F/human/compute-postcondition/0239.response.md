Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable) and the range is defined by `q`. The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `idx`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `q` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be decremented by 1, and `idx` must be increased by 2 (as given in the problem statement).

Given these points, we can now construct the new state for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

**State:**
- `q` is a positive integer minus 1 (i.e., `q - 1`).
- `idx` is increased by 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`q` is a positive integer minus 1, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has either appended 'YES' twice or 'NO'. `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence in `v1` that is not less than `r` and `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` that is just smaller than `l`. The condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` is true in the if part, and the condition `it1 >= len(v1)` or `it2 < 0` or `v1[it1] > r` or `v2[it2] < l` is true in the else part.**

Note: The values of `l`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged from the previous iteration since they are not affected by the loop head variables `q` and `idx`.
