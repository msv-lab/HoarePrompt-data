Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is False, and either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`.**

Explanation: The variable `impossible` is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `m`, or the conditions involving the list `gr`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged.
