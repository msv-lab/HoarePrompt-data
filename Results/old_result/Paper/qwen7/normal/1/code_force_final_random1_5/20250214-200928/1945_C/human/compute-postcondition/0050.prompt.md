Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is 100000000, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing all characters from the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is either 1, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`, and the first element of `s` is not '0'; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [3]. This is because if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is set to [3]; otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1` (so `n > 4`), `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [3, 4].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
