Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n - m + len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `cnt_b` is a dictionary with keys from the set of integers in `b` and values incremented by 1 for each index in `b`, `b_values` is a set of integers from the list `b`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i` is in the range `0` to `len(b)-1`.**

Explanation: The code `b_values = set(b)` creates a set from the list `b`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The set `b_values` now contains unique elements from the list `b`. All other variables (`a`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ans`, and `cnt_b`) retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
