Output State: **`x` is 1; `i` is increased by 1; `j` is increased by 1.**

Given the initial state where `x` is 1 and if `x` is 1, then the variable `j` is increased by 1, the code `i += x` increments `i` by the value of `x`, which is 1. Since `x` is 1, `j` is also increased by 1. Therefore, the updated values are `x` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.
