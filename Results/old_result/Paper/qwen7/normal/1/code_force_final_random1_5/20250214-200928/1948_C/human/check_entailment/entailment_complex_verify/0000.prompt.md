You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: Output State: The function returns 'No'.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have executed, the function will have returned 'No' if it did not encounter any instance where `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<' for any `i` from 0 to `half_n - 2`. Since the loop exits immediately upon finding such a condition, and we've gone through all possible iterations without finding one, the function must return 'No'.
    if (row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<') :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: The function returns 'No', `row1` and `row2` are lists of characters, and for all `i` from 0 to `half_n - 2`, `row1[2 * i + 1]` is not '<' or either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is not '<'.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)), a string \( row1 \) consisting of exactly \( n \) characters '<' and/or '>', and a string \( row2 \) consisting of exactly \( n \) characters '<' and/or '>'. The function checks specific conditions related to the characters in \( row1 \) and \( row2 \). If any condition is met, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even. row1 and row2 are strings of length n, consisting only of '<' and '>', representing the first and second rows of the grid respectively.

    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be the same as the initial value provided, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` will be the last values input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each of the `t` iterations, in the order they were computed.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2) for each of the t iterations, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the user input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, a string `row1`, and a string `row2`. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, each on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical flaw. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can or cannot reach the cell (2, n). Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
4
<>><
><>>
```

- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves right to (1, 2) because the arrow in (1, 1) points right.
- From (1, 2), it moves left to (1, 1) because the arrow in (1, 2) points left.
- From (1, 1), it moves right to (1, 2) again.
- From (1, 2), it moves right to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it moves right to (1, 4).
- From (1, 4), it moves down to (2, 4).

However, the `func_1` function incorrectly returns 'No' for this case. This is because the function only checks certain conditions without considering the full path the robot can take. The function should simulate the entire path the robot takes, not just check specific conditions.

To fix this, the function needs to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step and check if it can reach (2, n). The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
