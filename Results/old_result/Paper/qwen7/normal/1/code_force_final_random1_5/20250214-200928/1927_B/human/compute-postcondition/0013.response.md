Output State: `j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is the `(rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)`-th element of `alp`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `l`. The list `ans` will contain `l` elements, with each element being determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` and then accessing the corresponding index in the list `alp`.
