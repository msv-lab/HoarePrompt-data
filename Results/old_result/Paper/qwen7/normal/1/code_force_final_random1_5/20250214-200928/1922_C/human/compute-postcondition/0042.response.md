Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, and `d2[i]` is now `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. This means that the previous value of `d2[i]` (which was either `1 + d2[i + 1]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` depending on the condition) is now replaced by the new value `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `n-4`.
