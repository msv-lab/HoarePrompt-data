Postcondition: `x` is the next element in the list `l`. If `x` equals 1, then `i` is increased by the value of `x` plus 1, `j` is increased by 3, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` and an additional element `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j` and an additional element `j`. If `x` does not equal 1, then `i` is increased by the value of `x`, `j` is increased by 2, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` and an additional element `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j` and an additional element `j`.
