Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `coef` is now `[None] * n`.**

The code initializes the `coef` list to a list of `None` values of the same length as `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
