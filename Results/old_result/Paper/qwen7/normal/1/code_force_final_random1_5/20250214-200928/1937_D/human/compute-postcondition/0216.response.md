Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to the current value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, and `n` remains greater than 0. The value of `l` remains the same, and the expressions for `a` and `b` are updated accordingly.
