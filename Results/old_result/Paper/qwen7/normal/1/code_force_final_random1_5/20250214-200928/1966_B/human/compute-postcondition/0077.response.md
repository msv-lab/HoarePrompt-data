Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` is greater than 1
   - `impossible` is a boolean variable whose value is determined by the condition involving the elements of the matrix `gr`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `m-2` (inclusive). This means the loop will run `m-1` times.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know it involves checking conditions related to the elements of the matrix `gr`.

4. **Adjusting States**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop. The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

5. **Increment of `j`**: Since the loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `m-2`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. If `j` was 0 before, it will now be 1.

6. **Value of `m`**: The value of `m` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since the problem does not mention any modification to `m`, we assume `m` remains the same.

7. **Condition for `impossible`**: The value of `impossible` is determined by the condition involving the elements of the matrix `gr`. However, this condition is not directly affected by the loop itself but rather by the values in the matrix. Since no changes are mentioned to be made to `impossible` within the loop, its value remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `impossible` is a boolean variable whose value is determined by the condition involving the elements of the matrix `gr`**.
