Based on the initial state provided:

- `visited[i]` is `True` for every `i` in the range of `n`, meaning all nodes have been visited.
- `coef[i]` is `1` for every `i` where `visited[i]` is `True`, meaning the coefficient for each visited node is `1`.
- `tot` is the sum of all non-zero contributions made during the DFS calls for each component.
- `bipartite` is `True` for each component where the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not zero.
- `ok` is `False` since no component is bipartite with a non-zero `tot`.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
