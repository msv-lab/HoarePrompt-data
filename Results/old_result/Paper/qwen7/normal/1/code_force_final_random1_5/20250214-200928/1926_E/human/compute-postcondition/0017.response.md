Output State: `n` is now 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing three elements: `(n + 1) // 2`, 0, and another value which is also `(n + 1) // 2`.

Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as `n` is non-zero. After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `m`, where `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. Once `n` becomes 0, the loop terminates. Given that the output state after 3 iterations shows `n` is 0, it means the loop has completed its execution. The list `L` contains the values of `m` from each iteration, which are `(n + 1) // 2`, 0, and another `(n + 1) // 2`.
