You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n and 0 <= m, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be the initial value of `k` minus the sum of `(m - a[i])` for all `i` in the range of `n` where `a[i] < m`. The list `a` and the integer `n` will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, and `m` will also remain unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will have been decreased by the difference `(m - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, and the list `a` and the integer `n` will retain their state from the last iteration of the loop.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `i` is equal to `n`, `k` has been decreased by the difference `(m - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, the list `a` and the integer `n` retain their state from the last iteration of the loop, and `k` is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_14` accepts four parameters: `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers (0 <= n and 0 <= m), and `k` is an integer.
#
#Based on the output cases:
#- Case_1: The function returns 1.
#- Case_2: The function returns -1.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_14` is to accept a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`, and return either 1 or -1 based on some condition within the function body.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
