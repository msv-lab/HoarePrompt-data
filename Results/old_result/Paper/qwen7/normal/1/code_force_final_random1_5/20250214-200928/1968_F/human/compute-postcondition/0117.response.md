Output State: **`i` is 3, `idx` is 4, `a[1]` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `pf[1]` is `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing 2, `a[i]` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 3, so after executing the code, `idx` becomes 4. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
