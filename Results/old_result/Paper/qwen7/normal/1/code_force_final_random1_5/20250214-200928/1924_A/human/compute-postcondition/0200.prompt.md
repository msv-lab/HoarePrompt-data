Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^5, and we have read the value of `t` from input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the original string `s`, `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `i` remains either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` becomes 3, `k` becomes greater than 3, and `ans` becomes the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, which is 'a' * (m - 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is 0, `ans` is the entire string `s` concatenated in some order based on the conditions provided, and `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding 'a' multiplied by `(n - cnt - 1)`, and `cur` is an integer that has been updated through all iterations, `tmp` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'j' based on the conditions met in each iteration, `i` is equal to `k`, and `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If `cnt` has incremented to a value greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt` is still less than `n`, `ans` is set to "abba" and `cur` is reset to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
