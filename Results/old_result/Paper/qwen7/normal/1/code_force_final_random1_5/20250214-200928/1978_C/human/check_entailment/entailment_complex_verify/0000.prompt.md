You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `c` will be the total number of times the loop ran, which is determined by the value of `n` and how many times the loop condition `range(n, -1, -2)` holds true. The variable `i` will be `n` minus twice the number of iterations minus 2. The variable `k` will be reduced by the sum of all `i` values minus the number of iterations plus 1. Finally, `l` will be the result of repeatedly applying `func_3(c, l)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 inclusive. It processes these inputs through a series of operations, including updating `k` and calling other functions (`func_2` and `func_3`). Depending on the conditions met during its execution, it may return either the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` with `c` being 1 or 2, or the result of `func_3(3, l)`. If `k` reaches 0 before the loop completes, it returns `l` directly. The final state of the program includes the count of loop iterations (`c`), the adjusted value of `k`, and the transformed list `l` resulting from repeated applications of `func_3`.

    #The program returns the list `l` which is a permutation of length `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer less than the length of the list `l`), `k` (an integer between 0 and `c` inclusive), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`). It swaps the elements at positions `c` and `c - k` in the list `l`. After performing the swap, it returns the modified list `l`, which remains a permutation of length `n`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `c`, a positive integer within the range 1 to half the length of the list `l`, and `l`, a list of integers representing a permutation. It returns the list `l` with the elements at index `c - 1` and `-c` swapped.

    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0 and 0
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split and is divisible by 2, and `max_k` is set to `n` plus 5 if `n` is odd, otherwise `max_k` is set to `n`.

    #The program returns n and k, where n is an integer obtained from the first input split and k is an integer obtained from the second input split and is divisible by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \). It then checks if \( k \) is divisible by 2. If \( k \) is not divisible by 2, it returns two zeros (0, 0). If \( k \) is divisible by 2, it calculates a maximum value \( max_k \) based on \( n \). If \( max_k \) is less than \( k \), it returns two zeros (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

    #
    #In simpler terms, the loop has printed every number in the list `l` from start to end, one by one, without repeating any numbers.
    print()
    #This is printed: \n
    return
    #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `l` representing a valid permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of this permutation is equal to `k`. It prints "YES" followed by each element of the list `l` on the same line separated by spaces. After executing the loop, it prints a newline character. The function does not return any value.

    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program returns the value of `l` which is the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It first calls `func_4()` to get values for `n` and `k`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and does not return any value. Otherwise, it calculates a value `l` using `func_1(n, k)` and then processes `l` using `func_5(l)`. Finally, it returns the value of `l`, which is the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))` if `n` is not 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation with the given Manhattan value, but it does not cover all possible scenarios, particularly when the required Manhattan value `k` is odd or when the length `n` is odd and `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for that `n`.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 1` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, there should be no permutation of length 1 with a Manhattan value of 1, so the output should be "No". However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly and might return a permutation, leading to an incorrect result.

Additionally, the function `func_1` has a logical flaw in how it handles the construction of the permutation when `k` is odd. It always divides `k` by 2, which is incorrect because the Manhattan value can be odd, and the function does not account for this possibility.

To fix these issues, the program needs to properly handle cases where `k` is odd and ensure that the constructed permutation meets the exact Manhattan value requirement.
