Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing four elements where the first three elements are 0 and the fourth element is `a[4] - a[3]`, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `i` is 5, `len(a)` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is initially 4, the difference `a[4] - a[3]` is calculated and appended to `ad`, making the length of `ad` four elements long. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
