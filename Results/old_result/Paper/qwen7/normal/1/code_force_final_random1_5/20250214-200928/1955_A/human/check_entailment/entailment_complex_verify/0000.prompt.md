You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `i` being equal to the total number of iterations (which is the same as the number of test cases entered), `A`, `B`, and `C` being the last integers entered by the user for the final test case. The variable `X` is either the integer value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division if `A` was odd in any of the iterations, or it is the integer value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division for the last iteration if `A` was even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). For each test case, it prints one of three values based on specific conditions involving \(A\) and \(B\). Specifically, if \(B \times 2\) is less than \(C\), it prints \(A \times B\); if \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\); otherwise, it calculates \(\frac{A}{2}\) (integer division) and prints the result multiplied by \(C\) plus \(B\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where buying in pairs using the promotion price is cheaper than buying individually, especially when the total number of yogurts `A` is odd. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 5 11
```
- The program checks if `B * 2 < C`, which is `5 * 2 < 11` (True), so it prints `A * B` which is `3 * 5 = 15`.
- However, the optimal solution is to buy one yogurt at `B` and the remaining two at `C`, resulting in `5 + 11 = 16`.

The program fails to account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results in cases where buying in pairs is more cost-effective.
