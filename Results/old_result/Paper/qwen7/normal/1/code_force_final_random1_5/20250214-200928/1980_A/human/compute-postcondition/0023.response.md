Output State: **`freq[prob - 'A']` is incremented by 1, `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` by 1. Since `prob` is the next element in the list `a`, `freq[prob - 'A']` was already incremented by 1 in the previous line. Therefore, both `freq[prob - 'A']` and `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` have been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
