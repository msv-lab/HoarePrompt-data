Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '>', the condition `l < r` is still false; `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from the current value of `b`. Since the exact values of `idx_A[l - 1]`, `idx_A[l - r - 1]`, `l`, and `r` are not specified, we keep them in their symbolic form. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
