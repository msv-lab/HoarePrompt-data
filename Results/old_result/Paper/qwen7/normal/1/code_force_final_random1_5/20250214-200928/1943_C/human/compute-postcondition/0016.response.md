Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by 4, `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by 2, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing `u` and `u`, `u` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decreases the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` was initially the first integer from the input decreased by 3, after the operation, `u` becomes the first integer from the input decreased by 4. The values of `n`, `v`, and `u2vs[v]` remain unchanged.
