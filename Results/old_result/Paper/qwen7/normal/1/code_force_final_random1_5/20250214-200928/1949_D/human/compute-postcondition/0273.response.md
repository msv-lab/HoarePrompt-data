Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is given as `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `nx` is an empty string.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means `j` will take values from 1 up to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be within the range of 1 to `n + 1`.
   - Initially, `j` is set to 1 (the starting value of the range).

5. **Consider the initial conditions**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1, the loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `j` should be 1 initially.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1**
