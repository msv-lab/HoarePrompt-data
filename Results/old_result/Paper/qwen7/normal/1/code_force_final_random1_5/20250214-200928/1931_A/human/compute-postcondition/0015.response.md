To determine what will be printed, let's break down the conditions and their implications:

1. **Condition 1**: If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is a string containing the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
   - This means if `n > 52`, `word` will be something like `alphabet[n-53] + 'zz'`.

2. **Condition 2**: If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), then `word` is "az".
   - This means if `27 <= n <= 52`, `word` will be "az".

3. **Condition 3**: If `n` is less than or equal to 26, then `word` is 'aaa'.
   - This means if `n <= 26`, `word` will be 'aaa'.

Given these conditions, we need to consider the possible values of `n`:

- If `n` is greater than 52, `word` will be constructed as described.
- If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` will be "az".
- If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` will be 'aaa'.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact printed value without knowing `n`. However, based on the conditions, we can describe the possible outputs:

- If `n > 52`, `word` will be a string starting with a character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
- If `27 <= n <= 52`, `word` will be "az".
- If `n <= 26`, `word` will be 'aaa'.

Therefore, the output depends on the value of `n`:

Output: **word (where word is determined based on the value of n as described above)**
