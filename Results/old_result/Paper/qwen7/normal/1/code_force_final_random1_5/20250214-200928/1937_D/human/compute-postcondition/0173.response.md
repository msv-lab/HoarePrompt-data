Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0. This means that if `i` was initially 0, it would remain 0 because adding 1 to 0 does not change its value. If `i` was any other number, it would be incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0. This is a condition on `n` but does not affect the value of `i` directly.
- `r` is decreased by 1. This means that `r` is now one less than its original value, but since `r` is not used in the print statement, it does not affect the output.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

We need to determine the value of `i + 1`:
- If `i` was 0, then `i + 1` would be 1.
- If `i` was any other number, say `k`, then `i + 1` would be `k + 1`.

Since the exact initial value of `i` is not specified, we consider both cases:
- If `i` was 0, `i + 1` is 1.
- If `i` was any other number, `i + 1` would be that number plus 1.

However, the most precise and general answer considering the possible values of `i` is that `i + 1` will be the value of `i` increased by 1.

Output: **i + 1 (where i + 1 is the value of i increased by 1)**
