Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(ar) - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `len(ar) - 1` is a constant value based on the length of the list `ar`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 (since the step is -1).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `i` must start at 0 and decrease until it reaches a point where the loop condition fails (i.e., `i < 0`).
   - `len(ar) - 1` is a fixed value and does not change within the loop.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly initialized and decreases appropriately within the loop. Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i` is non-negative.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `i` starts at 0 and will decrement until it no longer satisfies the loop condition.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `len(ar) - 1` is a fixed value based on the length of `ar`

Since `len(ar) - 1` is a fixed value derived from the length of `ar`, it doesn't need to be explicitly stated in the final state unless it's relevant to the loop condition. However, for clarity, we can include it.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 0, `len(ar) - 1` is a fixed value based on the length of `ar`**
