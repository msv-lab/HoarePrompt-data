Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is True.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, assigning the result to `n`. This does not affect the values of `tc`, `arr`, or `dp`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
