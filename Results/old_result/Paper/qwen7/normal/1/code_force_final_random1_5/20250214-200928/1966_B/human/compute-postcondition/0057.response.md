Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `tc` in the range `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `tc` is less than `t`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
   - `tc` is 0
   - `n` is an integer
   - `m` is an integer
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and 'YES' otherwise
   - `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `tc` in the range `t`, `tc` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `tc` will be 1 (since it was 0 and will be incremented by 1).
   - `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, and `impossible` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`.**
