Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, and if `total_points` is odd, then `resultats` contains `-1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_matchs` by performing integer division of `total_points` by 2. The value of `total_points` remains `p1 + p2 + p3`, and the condition for `resultats` being `-1` if `total_points` is odd still holds. No other variables are affected.
