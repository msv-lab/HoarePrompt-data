Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through test cases where t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), and for each test case, n is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5) and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5. It returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.**
