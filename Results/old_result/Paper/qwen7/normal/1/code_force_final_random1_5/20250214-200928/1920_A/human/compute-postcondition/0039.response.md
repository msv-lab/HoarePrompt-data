Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`, and `num` is a list containing `[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `v` is an input integer, the list `num` now contains the element `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
