Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: From the postcondition given, we know:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.
   - If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then no changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `(m % a != 0 or m % b != 0 or (a == 1) or (b == 1))` holds true.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - Since `t` does not change within the loop, `t` remains the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration.

4. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**.
