Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a valid line of input starting from the second line.
- `n` is the integer representation of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers.
- `k` is the integer representation of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers.
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from splitting and converting the string `s`.

The print statement is `print(2 * n - 1)`. 

To determine what will be printed, we need to know the value of `n`. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we will represent it as `n`.

The expression `2 * n - 1` will be evaluated with the value of `n`.

Output: **2 * n - 1 (where n is the integer representation of the first element in s split by spaces and converted to integers)**
