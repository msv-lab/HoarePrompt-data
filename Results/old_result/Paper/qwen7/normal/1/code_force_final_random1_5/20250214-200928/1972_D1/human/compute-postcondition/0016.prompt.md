You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) such that \(i^2 \leq n + i\), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\), and `n` must be a non-negative integer.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\).
    #- For each iteration, `ans` is incremented by \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
    #- The loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.
    #- Once \(i^2 > n + i\), the loop terminates.
    #- Therefore, the final value of `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid `i` values, and `i` will be the smallest integer satisfying \(i^2 > n + i\).
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values, minus 1, where \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) and the loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values, minus 1, where \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) and the loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values, minus 1, where \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) and the loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
