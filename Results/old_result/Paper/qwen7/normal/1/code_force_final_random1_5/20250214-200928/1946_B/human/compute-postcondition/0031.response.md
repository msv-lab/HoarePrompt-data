Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `t + 2`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and now includes `suf[i + 1]` (since `suf[i + 1]` is appended to `smin`).**

In this output state, the variable `smin` has been updated by appending `suf[i + 1]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
