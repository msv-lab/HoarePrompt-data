You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, i is 0, k is 0, and the list l is reversed compared to its initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. The function returns a list `l` based on the following cases:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a variable 'l', but 'l' is not defined in the given code snippet.

Case_2: The program returns the list `l` with its second last element inserted at index `-k`.

Case_3: The program returns the list `l` which has its first element as `x`

Case_4: The program returns a list 'l' where its second last element is inserted at index -k, with k being n-1.

Case_5: The program returns a list `l` where the first element is equal to the second last element, and the second last element is the same as the first element.

Case_6: The program returns the list `l` which contains a single element `val`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
