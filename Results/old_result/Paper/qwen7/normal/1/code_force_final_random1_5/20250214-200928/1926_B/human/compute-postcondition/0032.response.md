Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an empty list, `b` is the input string from the user, `num` must be a positive integer**.

Explanation: The code `b = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `k`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
