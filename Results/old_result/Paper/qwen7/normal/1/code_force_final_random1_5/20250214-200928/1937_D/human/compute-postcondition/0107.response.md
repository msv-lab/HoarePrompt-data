Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `r` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, `n` remains greater than 0, and `r` is decreased by 1. The condition that the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>' is still valid since `i` is still 0 and no information about `s` was altered.
