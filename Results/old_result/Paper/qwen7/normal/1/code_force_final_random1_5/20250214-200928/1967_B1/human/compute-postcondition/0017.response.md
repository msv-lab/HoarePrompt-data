Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` must be less than or equal to 2, `ans` is `n` + 1, `countmins` is 0, `g` is 1**

Explanation: The code `countmins = int(count - 1)` updates the value of `countmins` to be `count - 1`. Since `count` must be less than or equal to 2, `count - 1` will be 1 when `count` is 2, and 0 when `count` is 1. Therefore, `countmins` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
