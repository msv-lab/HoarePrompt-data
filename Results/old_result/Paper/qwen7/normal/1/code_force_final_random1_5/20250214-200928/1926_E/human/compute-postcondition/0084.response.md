Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 32, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second input to `k`. The initial values of `a`, `L`, `tot`, `k`, and `pow` remain unchanged. The variable `t` is not defined in the initial state and the code does not assign any value to it, so it remains undefined. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values for `n` and `k`, while keeping the other variables as they were initially.
