Output State: **`elements` is updated such that the element at the index `line[ind]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `ind` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `elements` list such that the element at the index specified by `line[ind]` is set to the tuple `(i, ind)`. Additionally, `ind` is incremented by 1 to point to the next character in `line`. The initial state of `ind` being the index of the next character in `line` is maintained, just incremented by 1 after the operation.
