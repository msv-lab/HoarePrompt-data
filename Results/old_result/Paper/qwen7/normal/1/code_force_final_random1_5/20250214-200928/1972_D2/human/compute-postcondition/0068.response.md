Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6, but the function definition does not include any parameters, it implies that the function does not take any external inputs. Therefore, the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything based on the provided information.
