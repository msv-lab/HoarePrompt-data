Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the concept of MEX as described. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as required. Instead, it attempts to find the smallest missing number in the counter of the input array, which does not align with the game's rules.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
```

This happens because the program tries to find the smallest number that is not present in the counter of the input array, which is not the correct approach for this game. The correct approach would involve simulating the turns of Alice and Bob to ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

Here is a brief outline of what the correct implementation should do:
1. Alice always picks the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
2. Bob always picks the largest available number to minimize the MEX.

Given these points, the current implementation fails to correctly simulate the game's turns and thus is incorrect.
