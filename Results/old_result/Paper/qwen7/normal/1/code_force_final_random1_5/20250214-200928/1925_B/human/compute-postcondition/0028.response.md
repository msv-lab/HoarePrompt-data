Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum value between its previous value and `x // i`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `ans` is updated based on the current value of `x // i`.
