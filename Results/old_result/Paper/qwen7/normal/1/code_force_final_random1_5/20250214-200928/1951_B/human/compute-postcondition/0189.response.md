Output State: **`j` is increased by 2**

Explanation: Initially, `j` was increased by 1. The code `ans += 1` increments `ans` by 1. Since `ans` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After executing `ans += 1`, `ans` becomes 1. Therefore, `j` is increased by 1 (from the initial state) plus another 1 from the code execution, making `j` increased by 2 in total.
