Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1` (so `n > 3`)
   - `zero` is 1
   - `one` is 2
   - `zero_perc` is 50
   - `one_perc` is -100
   - `lst` is [3]

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 4 (since `3 < n - 1` implies `n > 4`).

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1` (so `n > 4`), `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [3]**
