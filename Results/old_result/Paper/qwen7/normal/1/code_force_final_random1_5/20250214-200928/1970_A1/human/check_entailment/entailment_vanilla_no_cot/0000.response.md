Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution contains a logical error in the `func_1` function, which is not used in the actual implementation but is included in the code. However, the main issue lies in the `func_2` function where the `BalanceInfo` class is referenced but not defined in the provided code snippet. 

To correctly implement the solution, you need to define the `BalanceInfo` class and ensure that the logic for sorting and constructing the result is accurate. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = "(()(()))"
    func_2(s)
```

This corrected version defines the `BalanceInfo` class and ensures that the sorting and construction of the result are done correctly. The `func_2` function now works as intended and will produce the correct output for the given input.
