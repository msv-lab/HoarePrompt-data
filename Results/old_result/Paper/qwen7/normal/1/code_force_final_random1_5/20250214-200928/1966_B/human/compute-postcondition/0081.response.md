Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 1
- `m` is greater than 1
- `impossible` is False if `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.

2. **Variable `m`:**
   - `m` is a constant for the entire loop and does not change within the loop.
   - Therefore, `m` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, which is greater than 1.

3. **Variable `impossible`:**
   - The value of `impossible` depends on the conditions involving `gr[0][j]` and `gr[n - 1][j]`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `impossible` is False if `gr[0][1]` is not equal to `gr[0][2]` or `gr[n - 1][1]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][2]`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be 2, so the conditions will check `gr[0][2]` and `gr[0][3]` or `gr[n - 1][2]` and `gr[n - 1][3]`.

### Updated State
- `j` will be 2.
- `m` remains greater than 1.
- `impossible` will be updated based on the new conditions involving `gr[0][2]` and `gr[0][3]` or `gr[n - 1][2]` and `gr[n - 1][3]`.

### Final Answer
State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, and `impossible` is False if `gr[0][2]` is not equal to `gr[0][3]` or `gr[n - 1][2]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][3]`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.**
