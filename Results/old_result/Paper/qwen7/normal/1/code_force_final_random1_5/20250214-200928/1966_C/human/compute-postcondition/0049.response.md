Output State: `tc` is `0`; `i` is `n`; `dp` is a boolean value determined by the final iteration's condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `tc` will be reduced to `0` because it starts as `tc` and decreases by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop exits when `tc` becomes `0`, and the last operation within the loop sets `i` to `n`. The variable `dp` will hold the result of the final condition check `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` or not `dp` from the last iteration of the loop.
