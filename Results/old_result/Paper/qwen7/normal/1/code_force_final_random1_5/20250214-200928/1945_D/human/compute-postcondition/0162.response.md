Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is `na_frente`, `c` is 2, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` added to the previous value of `total`, `best` is 10000000000.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
