Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is either 2 or 1, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1. Since `pos` was either 1 or 2 initially, after incrementing by 1, `pos` will now be either 2 or 1 (depending on the initial value). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the operation performed.
