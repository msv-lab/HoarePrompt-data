Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, the difference between the second element and the first element of list `d1` is 1, the difference between the first element and the zeroth element of list `d1` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 2` becomes 3. Since `i + 1` is 2, `d1[2]` (the second element of `d1`) is updated to `1 + d1[1]`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `d1[1]`, but we know that `d1[2]` is now `1 + d1[1]`. Also, since `d1[1]` was previously unspecified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know the difference between `d1[2]` and `d1[1]` is 1. The difference between `d1[1]` and `d1[0]` is assumed to be 0 because no other information is given about `d1[0]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
