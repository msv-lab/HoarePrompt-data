Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to the original value of `t`, `i` is equal to `t + n - 1`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration.

This output state describes the final condition of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the original value of `t`. After each iteration, the variable `i` increments by 1, starting from `t` and ending at `t + n - 1`. The list `smin` grows by one element in each iteration, appending the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin`.
