Output State: The `resultats` list will contain the final results for all the tuples in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`, the loop will compute `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs = total_points // 2`, and `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Depending on the conditions, `resultats` will append either `-1` or `egalites // 2` to itself. After all iterations, `resultats` will be a list containing the results for each tuple in `cas_de_test`, with `-1` appended if any condition fails, otherwise `egalites // 2`.

The `total_matchs` and `egalites` variables will be recalculated for each tuple, but their specific values are not preserved outside the loop as they are used only within the loop body. The `total_points` variable will also be recalculated for each tuple but similarly does not persist outside the loop.
