Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 16.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will take the last value from the list `L`, which is 1. The list `L` will be reduced to its last element, so `L` becomes [1]. The total sum `tot` will be the sum of all elements in the original list `L`, which is 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8 (from the initial state) + 4 (from the first iteration) + 1 (from the second iteration) + 2 (from the third iteration) = 15 - 3 = 12. The variable `k` remains between 8 and 12 as it was in the previous state. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration of the loop, so after 4 iterations, `pow` is 2^4 = 16.
