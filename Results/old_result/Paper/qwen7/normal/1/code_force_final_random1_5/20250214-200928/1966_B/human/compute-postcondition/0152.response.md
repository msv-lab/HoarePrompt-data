Output State: `impossible` is `False`, `ans` remains `'NO'`, `i` is `n - 1`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2, and the conditions `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]) or (gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` and `(gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1])` remain satisfied.

In this final state after all iterations of the loop, `i` has reached its maximum value of `n - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`. The other variables (`impossible`, `ans`, `gr`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The conditions specified in the problem statement continue to hold true.
