Output State: **`m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is len(a), `i` is 1, `s` is bisect_left(a, ql), `ql` is an input integer - `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `m` is now `b[s - 1]` plus the calculated value. All other variables retain their initial states.
