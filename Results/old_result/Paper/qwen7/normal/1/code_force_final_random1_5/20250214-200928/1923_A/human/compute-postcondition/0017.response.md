Output State: **`arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`; `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`; `_` is 1; `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` takes an input string, splits it into a list of words, and then joins these words back together into a single string with no spaces between them. This updates the value of `arr`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `_`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state. Additionally, `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`.
