Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and `resultats` is a list containing `egalites // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the list `resultats`. Since `egalites` is defined as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, the updated `resultats` list will contain this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
