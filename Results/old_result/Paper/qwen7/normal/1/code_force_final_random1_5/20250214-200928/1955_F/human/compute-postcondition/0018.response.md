Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and each of these elements is an odd integer, `cnt` is the sum of 1 and the floor division of each element in `a` (from the first to the last) by 2, `a` is updated to a list of integers from input**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the initial state specifies that the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd integers, the input should maintain this property. However, the exact values of these elements are now determined by the user's input. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it directly, but its calculation depends on the new values of `a`.
