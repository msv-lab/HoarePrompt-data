Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, or `x`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged, while `n` and `k` are updated to the new integer inputs.
