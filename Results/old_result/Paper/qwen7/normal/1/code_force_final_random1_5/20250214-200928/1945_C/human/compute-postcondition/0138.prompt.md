Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed all iterations. The variable `i` is equal to `n-2`. The variable `n` is greater than 0. The variable `zero` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `i`. The variable `one` is equal to `i + 1`. The variable `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. The variable `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then the list `lst` will contain the value `i + 2`. Otherwise, `lst` will remain unchanged. The variables `t`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, and `lst` will retain their final values from the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` must have at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lst` must have at least one element, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the next element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the next element in `lst`; `lst` must have at least two elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
