#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - m`, `cnt_b` will be reset to zero for all elements in `b_values`, `curr` will hold the final count as per the loop's logic, and `ans` will be the total count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the entire loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). For each test case, it counts the number of times the current count of common elements between lists a and b is greater than or equal to k. The function prints the total count of such occurrences across all test cases and returns nothing explicitly.
