Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem statement and the example given.

1. **Problem Understanding**: We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
   - It then enters a loop where `count` is incremented until it exceeds `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins`, `g`, and updates `ans` based on these calculations.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Algorithm Evaluation**:
   - The logic inside the loop seems to be trying to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) by incrementing `count` and adjusting `ans` based on some arithmetic operations.
   - However, the specific details of how `ans` is updated do not directly align with the problem constraints. Specifically, the update of `ans` using `int(g / count) + 1` does not seem to correctly reflect the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\).

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify the output for one of the examples:
     - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the expected output is 14.
     - The program's output matches this expectation, but we need to ensure that the logic is correct for all cases.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to have a logical flaw in how it counts the valid pairs. The specific arithmetic operations used to update `ans` do not seem to correctly implement the required logic.

Correctness: **False**
