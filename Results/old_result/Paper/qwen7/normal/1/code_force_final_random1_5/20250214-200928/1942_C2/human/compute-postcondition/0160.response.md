Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in val:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `val`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `val`. 

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is -1
   - `x` is greater than or equal to 3 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `c` is -1
   - `y` is `c - 1`, so `y` is -1
   - `sx` is `y * 2`, so `sx` is -2

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is -1 and the loop is iterating over `val`, the next value of `i` will be the first element in `val`.
   - Therefore, `i` will change to the first element of `val`.
   - The values of `x`, `c`, `y`, and `sx` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is -1, `y` is -1, `sx` is -2**
