Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that at the end of the previous iteration:
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `tmp` is calculated as `'a' + i - i_prev - 1`.
   - The condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` determines whether to break out of the loop or not.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `i_prev` will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, we assume it remains the same.
   - The value of `cur` will only change if the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` is false and the else part of the loop modifies `cur`. However, since no specific changes to `cur` are mentioned in the else part, we assume `cur` remains unchanged unless otherwise specified.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop variable `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is 'a' + `i` - `i_prev` - 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i_prev` is the same as before.**
