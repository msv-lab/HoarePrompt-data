Output State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l` (if it exists), `i` is increased by the value of `x`, `j` is increased by 2, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` and an additional element `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j` and an additional element `j`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. The initial state indicates that `j` is increased by 2, so `c` now contains the new value of `j` and an additional element which is the same as `j`. The values of `x`, `i`, and `j` are updated according to their respective rules, and `p` is updated to include the new value of `i` and an additional element `i`.
