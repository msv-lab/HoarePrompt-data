You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a list \( x \) of \( n-1 \) integers (1 ≤ \( x_i \) ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it calculates a list \( a \) of length \( n \) where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list \( x \). The function then prints the elements of the list \( a \) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). Specifically, the value of \( a_i \) is set to \( a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \), which does not necessarily ensure that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The program outputs:
```
1000 1002 1006
```
However, the conditions are not met:
- \( x_2 = 2 \), but \( 1002 \bmod 1000 = 2 \) is true.
- \( x_3 = 4 \), but \( 1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 \) is true.

But let's consider another example:
```
3
1 1
```
The program outputs:
```
1000 1001 1002
```
However, the conditions are not met:
- \( x_2 = 1 \), but \( 1001 \bmod 1000 = 1 \) is true.
- \( x_3 = 1 \), but \( 1002 \bmod 1001 = 1 \) is true.

This example is actually valid, but we need to check further. Consider:
```
4
2 4 2
```
The program outputs:
```
1000 1002 1006 1010
```
However, the conditions are not met:
- \( x_3 = 4 \), but \( 1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 \) is true.
- \( x_4 = 2 \), but \( 1010 \bmod 1006 = 4 \neq 2 \).

Thus, the program does not always produce an array \( a \) that satisfies the given conditions.
