Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0
- `m` is 0
- `a` is the input integer `k`
- `b` is the input integer `k`
- `s` is `p[k] - p[k - 1]`
- `n` is the first input integer from `input().split()`
- `t` is a positive integer
- `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`
- `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l`
- `n, m = map(int, input().split())` executes and `n` and `m` are assigned the respective integers from the input
- `p` is now `[0]`
- `c` is now `[0]`
- `i, j = 0, 0` executes and both `i` and `j` are assigned 0

### Loop Head:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for x in l:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- The loop variable `x` is iterating over the elements of the list `l`.

### Adjusting States:
- The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the elements of `l`.
- For the loop to execute, `l` must contain at least one element.

### Relevant States to Adjust:
- `l` must have at least one element.

### Final State Adjustment:
Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `l` must have at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` must have at least one element**
