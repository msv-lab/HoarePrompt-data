Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and iterates through the commands in the string `s` to process the array `a` as required.
3. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command and appends the result to the list `b`.
4. After processing all commands, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` and stores these values in the list `ans`.
5. Finally, it returns the list `ans` in the correct order (from the first command to the last command).

Given the logic and the steps described, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
