You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers: the number of test cases \(t\), an integer \(n\), and an integer \(k\). For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\). Specifically, it constructs a list \(L\) by repeatedly dividing \(n\) by 2 and appending the result to \(L\) until \(n\) becomes 0. Then, it iterates over the list \(L\), determining the appropriate value to print based on the cumulative sum of elements in \(L\) and the value of \(k\). Finally, it returns no explicit value but outputs the calculated results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Building the List `L`:**
   - The list `L` is built to store the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - In each iteration of the `while` loop, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of cards laid down in the current step.
   - `n` is then updated by subtracting `m`.
   - This continues until `n` becomes zero.

3. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - `tot` is initialized to 0, and `pow` is set to 1.
   - The program iterates over the list `L` and checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]` for each element `a` in `L`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - `tot` is updated by adding `a` to it, and `pow` is doubled.

### Correctness Check

1. **Building the List `L`:**
   - The list `L` correctly stores the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - Each step corresponds to multiplying an odd number by a power of 2.

2. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - The logic for determining the k-th card is correct.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly identifies the card based on the current step and the position `k`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` might be small enough to complete all steps without needing to check further.
   - It correctly identifies the position of the k-th card in the sequence.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program accurately determines the k-th card laid down by Vladislav.
