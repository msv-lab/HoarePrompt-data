Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list named `array` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input, splitting the input string into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `t` and `l` remain unchanged.
