Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]` updates the value of `i` to be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. This means the value of `i` is now recalculated based on the current values of `c[b]` and `c[a - 1]`. The other variables (`s`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
