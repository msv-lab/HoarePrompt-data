Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is updated to the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains 'YES', `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` using the `bisect.bisect_left` function on `v2` with argument `r` and subtracts 1 from the result. The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `results`, `v2`, and `it1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `it2` is derived from the operation but its specific value depends on the contents of `v2` and the value of `r`.
