Output State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is an updated value (either unchanged or incremented by `cur_ss`), `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `ans` is equal to `ss` if `cur` does not equal `1 << cur_ss` and `2 * (ord(ss) - ord('a'))` otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` simply calculates the value of `cur_ss` as the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of `'a'`. This value is then assigned to `cur_ss`. The other variables (`cnt`, `cur`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unaffected by this line of code.
