Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation to the array. This means we need to rearrange the elements of the array such that the frequency of the most common number is maximized.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it sorts the unique elements of the array.
   - It then tries to maximize the frequency of the most common number by using a permutation of indices.
   - Specifically, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position where the current element plus the length of the array would fit in the sorted list, and calculates the difference to update the maximum frequency.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()`: Reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - `func_4()`: Sorts the array.
   - The main logic is implemented directly in the annotated function at the beginning of the snippet.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the unique elements and sorts them.
   - It then iterates through these unique elements, calculating the potential new positions and updating the maximum frequency.
   - The approach ensures that the permutation used maximizes the frequency of the most common number.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the sorting and unique elements correctly.
   - It accounts for the permutation by calculating the differences accurately.
   - The logic should work for the given constraints and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
