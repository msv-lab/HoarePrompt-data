Postcondition: `i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `x` must be greater than 0, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and the current value of `gap` is greater than 1 and is an odd number.
