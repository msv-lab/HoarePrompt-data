Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the value of `winner`, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The `results` list will contain `t` (which is now 0) elements, but since `t` is 0, the list will be empty. However, each element in the `results` list is the `winner` from the last iteration of the loop, as the `results` list is updated with the `winner` in each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the value of `winner`, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing `t-1` elements (all of which are the value of `winner`), `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `result` is the next element in the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing `t-2` elements, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `result` is the next element in the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
