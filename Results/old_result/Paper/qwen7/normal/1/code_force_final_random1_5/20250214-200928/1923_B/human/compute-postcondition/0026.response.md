Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is either 1 or 2, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, `rest` is `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The variable `rest` is decremented by the value of `delta`, which is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. Since `pos` can be either 1 or 2, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` will be one of the elements from the list `a` at the index specified by `sorted_indices[pos]`. However, the exact value of `rest` after the operation depends on the comparison between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
