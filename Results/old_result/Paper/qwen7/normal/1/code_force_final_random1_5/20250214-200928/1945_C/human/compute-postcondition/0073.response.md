Output State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order.**

The `sort()` method sorts the `final` list in place in ascending order. Since the initial state of `pk` and `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` now contains all elements of the original `lst` list sorted, these are the updated conditions after executing the code.
