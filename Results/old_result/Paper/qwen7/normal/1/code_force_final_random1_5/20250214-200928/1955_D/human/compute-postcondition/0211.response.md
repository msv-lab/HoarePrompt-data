Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1, and `ans` is 3 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains 2.**
