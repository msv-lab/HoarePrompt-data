Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` is empty.**

Explanation: The code `feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` takes input as a string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `feat`. The variables `i` and `n` are both assigned the value of the first element in `feat`, which is `feat[0]`. The list comprehension does not affect `array2`, so it remains empty.
