Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 4; `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is 5) is assigned the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` (which is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
