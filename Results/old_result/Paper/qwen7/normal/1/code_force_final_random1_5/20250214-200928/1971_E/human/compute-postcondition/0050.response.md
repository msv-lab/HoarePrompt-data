Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` is len(a), `i` is 1, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql - a[s - 1]` in the sorted list `a`, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `ql`. The values of `m`, `q`, `i`, `s`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `ql` is the integer input provided by the user.
