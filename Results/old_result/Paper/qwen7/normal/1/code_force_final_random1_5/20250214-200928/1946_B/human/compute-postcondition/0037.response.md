Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to the original value of `t`, `i` is equal to `t + n - 1`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is -111.**

The code assigns `-111` to the variable `sm`, which does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `n`, `i`, and `smin` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `sm` is now `-111`.
