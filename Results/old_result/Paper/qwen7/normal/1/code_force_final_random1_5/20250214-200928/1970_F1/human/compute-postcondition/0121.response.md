Postcondition: `line` is a string, `ind` is an index that is 1 more than the previous value, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`, `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has the additional element `(i, ind)` appended to it.
