Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `m` is greater than 0
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- Either `b - a + 1` is not greater than 1 or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
