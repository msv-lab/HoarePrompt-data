Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value of `winner` and the second element is also `winner`, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.

Explanation: The line `results.append(winner)` appends the value of `winner` to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contains one element (which is `winner`), after appending, it will contain two elements, both of which are `winner`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `winner` remain unchanged from their initial states.
