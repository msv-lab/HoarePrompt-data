Postcondition: `i` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value (1) and `ans`, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `x % i == 0`. The current value of `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `(x - n * i) % i` is equal to 0. Additionally, if `x // i` is greater than 0 and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` is equal to 0, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `x // i`.
