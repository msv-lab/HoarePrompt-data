Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes `cnt_b` to count the frequency of elements in `b`.
2. It iterates through each test case, updating the count of common elements between `a` and `b` using a sliding window approach.
3. The variable `curr` keeps track of the current count of common elements within the sliding window of size `m`.
4. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer (`ans`) for that test case.
5. After processing each test case, it resets `cnt_b` for the next test case.
6. The program handles the constraints and input/output format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the logic correctly and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
