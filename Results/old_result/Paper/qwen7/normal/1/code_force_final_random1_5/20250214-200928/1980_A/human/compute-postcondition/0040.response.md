Output State: `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each iteration of the loop; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain exactly `t` tuples, each tuple containing two integers `n` and `m` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 5\), and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; for each iteration `_` ranges from 0 to `t-1`, `n` is an integer from the `_`th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is an integer from the `_`th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is a string from the `_`th tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element represents the frequency count of characters 'A' through 'G' in the string `a`, and `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each element in `freq`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will be a list of `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the `missing` value calculated for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `missing` value is determined by counting how many extra occurrences of any character (beyond `m`) are required to meet the requirement `m` for each character in the input string `a` for each test case.
