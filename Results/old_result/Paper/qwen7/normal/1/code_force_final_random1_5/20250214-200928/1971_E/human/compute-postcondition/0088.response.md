Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b) - 1`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

3. **Initial state of `i`**: The problem does not specify an initial value for `i`. However, since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.

4. **Condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(b)` for the loop to continue executing.

Based on these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is set to 1 and `i` is less than `len(b)`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` should be set to 1.
- `i` should be less than `len(b)`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `i` must be less than `len(b)`**
