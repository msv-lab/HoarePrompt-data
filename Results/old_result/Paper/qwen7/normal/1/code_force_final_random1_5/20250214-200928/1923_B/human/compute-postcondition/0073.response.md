Output State: **`rest` is `rest - delta - delta`, `distance` is increased by 2, `pos` is equal to `pos + 1`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` subtracts `delta` from the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Given the initial conditions, `rest` was already decreased by `delta`, so now it is further reduced by `delta`. The `distance` is increased by 1 due to the operation, and since `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `pos` is incremented by 1. The value of `delta` is recalculated as `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`.
