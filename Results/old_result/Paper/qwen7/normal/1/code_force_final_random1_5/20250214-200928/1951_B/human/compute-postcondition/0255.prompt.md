Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The list a contains n distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements of the list `s` have been iterated over, `i` is now the last element of the list `s`, `h` remains as the last element of the original list (first element of the swapped list), `z` remains unchanged, and `ans1` is incremented by 1 each time `i` is not equal to `h` and `i` is not greater than `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the first element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `ans1` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether `s[0]` equals `h` or `i > h`, `z` is 1, and `s` is a non-empty list.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be the first element of the list `s` because the loop decrements `i` with each iteration until it reaches the first element. The variable `j` remains as the length of the list `s` minus 1 since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `p` remains equal to `j` as it is not changed within the loop. The variable `ans1` accumulates based on the conditions met during the loop's execution, and `z` is set to 1 if any condition in the loop body is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: p is equal to j (which is the length of the list s minus one), ans is the count of elements in s that are less than or equal to h, ans1 is the sum of 1 for each occurrence of h in s where s[0] != h, and z is 1 if there was at least one element in s that was greater than h and caused the loop to break, otherwise z is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
