Output State: **`suf` is updated such that suf[i+1] = suf[i] + l[i], and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends a new element to the list `suf`. This new element is the sum of the current element in `suf` (at index `i`) and the corresponding element in the list `l` (also at index `i`). The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
