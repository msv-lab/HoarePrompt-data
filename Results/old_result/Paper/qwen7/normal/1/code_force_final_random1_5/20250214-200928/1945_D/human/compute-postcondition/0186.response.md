Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is `v - 2`, `c` is 2, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 2]`, and `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increases the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, `c`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
