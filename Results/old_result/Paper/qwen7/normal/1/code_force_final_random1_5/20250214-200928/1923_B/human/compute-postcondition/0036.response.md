Postcondition: `distance`, `pos`, `sorted_indices`, `a`, and `rest` remain unchanged. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals `distance`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (i.e., it continues execution with the same values as the precondition).
