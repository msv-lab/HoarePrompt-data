Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `s`, `unique_chars` is a list with one additional element which is `char`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` inserts the character `char` into the list `unique_chars` at the position specified by `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it refers to the index where `char` should be inserted. After executing this line of code, `unique_chars` will contain all unique characters from the string `s` up to the current position of `char`.
