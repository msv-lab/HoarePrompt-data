Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` must be 0
   - `s` is an input string
   - `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 0 (which it already is) and `i` must be incremented to 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as there is no information suggesting it should change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`**
