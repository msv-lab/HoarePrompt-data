Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and `lst` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `i + 1` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 remains valid as no operations affect these variables.
