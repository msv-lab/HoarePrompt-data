Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `len(ar) - 1`, `-1`, and `-1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = -len(ar)` to `i = -1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will take values from `-len(ar)` to `-1` in descending order.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The state before the loop starts is given as `i` is `-len(ar)`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than or equal to `-1`. Since `i` is already `-len(ar)` at the start, and `-len(ar)` is always less than or equal to `-1` (assuming `len(ar) > 0`), the loop will execute.

5. **Adjust the states of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is already set to `-len(ar)`.
   - The loop will continue to decrement `i` until it reaches `-1`.
   - `len(ar)` is a constant value derived from the list `ar`, but its value does not change within the loop.
   - The loop does not directly use `mex` or `res` in its head, so these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being set to `-len(ar)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `-len(ar)`, `len(ar)` is a constant value derived from the list `ar`**
