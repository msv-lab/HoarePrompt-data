Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - The postcondition for `d1[i + 2]` is either `1 + d1[i + 1]` if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true, or `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` if the condition is false.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `n` is at least 3).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `n` must remain at least 3.

7. **Postcondition for `d1[i + 2]`**: 
   - Now `i` is 3, so we need to evaluate the postcondition for `d1[3 + 2] = d1[5]`.
   - The condition to check is `l[4] - l[3] < l[3] - l[2]`.
   - If the condition is true, then `d1[5] = 1 + d1[4]`.
   - If the condition is false, then `d1[5] = l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, and `d1[5]` is either 1 + `d1[4]` if `l[4] - l[3] < l[3] - l[2]` is true, or `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]` if the condition is false.**
