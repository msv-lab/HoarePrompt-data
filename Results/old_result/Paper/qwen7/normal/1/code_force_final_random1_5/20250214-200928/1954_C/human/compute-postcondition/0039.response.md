Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `a`, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index up to `len(a)-1`, and `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index up to `len(a)-1`.
