Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    d1[2] = 1
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
            d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
        else:
            d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
    d2[n - 1] = 1
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
            d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
        else:
            d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
    m = int(input())
    for j in range(m):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if y > x:
            print(d1[y] - d1[x])
        else:
            print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` must be greater than 0; `j` is equal to `m-1`; `x` and `y` are integers from the input for each iteration; if `y` is greater than `x` during any iteration, the difference `d1[y] - d1[x]` is printed; otherwise, the difference `d2[y] - d2[x]` is printed. The values of `m` and `j` do not change regardless of the conditions inside the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, `j` will be equal to the total number of iterations (which is `m`), and both `d1` and `d2` will remain unchanged from their initial states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is `m-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. The values of `j`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition `y > x` is true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
