Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`, and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp` to `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Given that `i` is 2, `dp` is updated to `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`. The other variables (`tc`, `i`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
