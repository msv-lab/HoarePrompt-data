Output State: **`t` is the new input integer minus 1, `a` is an input integer from the second input, `s` is updated to the new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `a` is an input integer from the current input.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` assigns the value of the new input (converted to an integer) to the variable `a`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
