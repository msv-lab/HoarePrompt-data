Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is equal to `n`, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every `i` in the range from 2 to `n`, and the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` must hold true for each of these elements.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `array2` will contain all the valid differences multiplied by `a` as long as they satisfy the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for each step from 2 to `n`.
