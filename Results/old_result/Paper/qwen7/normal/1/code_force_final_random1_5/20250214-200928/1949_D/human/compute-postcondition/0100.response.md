Output State: **`x` is an array, `j` is `j + 2`, `b[i]` is increased by 1.**

The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact nature of `b` or the index `i`, we can only state that `b[i]` is increased by 1. The value of `x` remains an array, and `j` is updated to `j + 2`.
