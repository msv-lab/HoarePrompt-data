Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The first element of `b` is an odd number and the second element of `b` is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is an odd number and the second last element of `b` is not equal to the last element plus 2.
