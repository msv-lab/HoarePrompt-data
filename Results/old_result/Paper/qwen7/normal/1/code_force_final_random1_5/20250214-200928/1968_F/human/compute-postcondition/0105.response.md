Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be considered are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and ends when `i < n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be 1, and `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is obtained from `data[idx]`, we need to ensure that `data[idx]` provides a value that is at least 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.

Given the initial conditions provided:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `idx` is increased by 4 * (n + 1)
- `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`
- `a` is now a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0
- `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0
- `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated
- `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and the last element appended to `results` is an empty string
- `mp` is updated to include {(0): [0]}
- `q` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
