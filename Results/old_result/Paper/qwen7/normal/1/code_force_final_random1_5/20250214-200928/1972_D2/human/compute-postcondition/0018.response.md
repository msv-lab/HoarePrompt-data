Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` (integer division) and `m // ((x + y) * y)` (floor division); `y` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnt` is determined by the minimum of two expressions involving `n`, `m`, `x`, and the updated `y`. The conditions for `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
