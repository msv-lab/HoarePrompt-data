To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `l` is 2
   - `m` is 0
   - `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(b[s], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`. The function `bisect_left` returns the index where `ql` should be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. If `ql` is already present in `a`, it returns the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql`.

However, the values of `a` and `ql` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `s` without these additional details. But we can still describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

The code snippet prints `b[s]`, where `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`. Since `b` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents either. Thus, the output will be the element in list `b` at the index determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

Output: **b[bisect_left(a, ql)]**
