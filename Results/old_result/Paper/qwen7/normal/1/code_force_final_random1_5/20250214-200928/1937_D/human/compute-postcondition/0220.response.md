Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` is incremented by 1, `a` retains its original value, `b` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `r`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their previous states. The conditions for updating `a` and `b` depend on the values of `l` and `r`, which are not specified to change in this step. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `l` and maintains the original values of `i`, `r`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.
