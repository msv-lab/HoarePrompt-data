Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `ele` from the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `lst`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - `i` is equal to `n-2`.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 4.
   - `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3.
   - `one` is either 2, 3, or 4.
   - `zero_perc` is 100.
   - `one_perc` is -100.
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ele` in `lst`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element.
   - After processing the current element `ele`, the length of `lst` decreases by one. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `lst` must have at least one more element.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `mini` remains unchanged because it is updated within the loop body but not modified here.
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `zero` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `one` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `zero_perc` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `one_perc` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `lst` must contain at least two elements (since one element has already been processed).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, zero is either 1, 2, or 3, one is either 2, 3, or 4, zero_perc is 100, one_perc is -100, and `lst` must contain at least two elements.**
