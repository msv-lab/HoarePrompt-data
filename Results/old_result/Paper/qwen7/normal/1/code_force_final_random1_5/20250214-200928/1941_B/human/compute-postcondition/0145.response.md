Postcondition: `stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - (i+1) * opNum`, `a[i+1]` is `a[i+1] - (i+1) * opNum - (i) * opNum`, `a[i+2]` is `a[i+2] - (i+1) * opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0`. Additionally, either `a[len(a) - 1]` is not `0` or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not `0`, or both `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]` are `0`.
