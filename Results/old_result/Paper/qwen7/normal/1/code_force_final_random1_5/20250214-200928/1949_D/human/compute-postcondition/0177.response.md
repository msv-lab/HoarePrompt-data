Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - The postcondition for the loop body execution is given.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration (when `j` is 2), the loop will increment `j` by 1, making `j` equal to 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < n + 1`.

4. **Postcondition for the Loop Body**:
   - If `xx[i][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is equal to `nx` plus `xx[i][1]`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' if `i` is in the first quarter of list `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of list `sa`, and 'S' appended to whatever was originally in `nx` before otherwise.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from 2 to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue but not modified within the loop itself.
   - The value of `nx` and the conditions involving `xx[i][1]`, `i`, and `sa` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0**
