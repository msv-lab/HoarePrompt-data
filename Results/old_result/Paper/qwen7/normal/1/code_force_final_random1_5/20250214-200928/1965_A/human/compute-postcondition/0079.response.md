Based on the initial state provided, the only variable that changes is `j`, which is updated to `j + 1`. However, the value of `j` itself is not explicitly stated in the initial state. Since the final print statement is simply `'Alice'`, and no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
