To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `year` is initially set to some value (let's call it `initial_year`).
   - For each element `ai` in the list `a`, `year` is updated by the formula: `year += year % ai or ai`.

2. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `year % ai`: This gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
   - `year % ai or ai`: This expression evaluates to `year % ai` if `year % ai` is truthy (non-zero), otherwise it evaluates to `ai`.

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - Let's assume the list `a` is `[a1, a2, ..., an]`.
   - Initially, `year = initial_year`.
   - For each `ai` in `a`:
     - If `year % ai` is non-zero, then `year += year % ai`.
     - Otherwise, `year += ai`.

4. **Final Value of `year`**:
   - After processing all elements in the list `a`, `year` will be the cumulative effect of the above operations.

Given this understanding, the `print(year)` statement will output the final value of `year` after all the operations have been applied.

Output: **the final value of `year` after applying the operation `year += year % ai or ai` for each element `ai` in the list `a`**
