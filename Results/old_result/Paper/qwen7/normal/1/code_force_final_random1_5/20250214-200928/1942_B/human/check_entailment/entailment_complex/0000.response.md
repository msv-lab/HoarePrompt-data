Reasoning:

1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this by iterating through the array \( a \) in reverse order and calculating the value of \( p \) for each position.
3. The key logic in the annotated program is:
   - Initialize `mex` to `n`.
   - For each index `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`:
     - Set `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`.
     - Update `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`.

However, this approach is flawed because:
- The value of `mex` should be updated correctly based on the current state of the permutation \( p \) being constructed, not just the values in the array \( a \).
- The logic to update `mex` after setting `res[i]` is incorrect. The correct approach would involve ensuring that the value assigned to `res[i]` does not conflict with previously assigned values in the permutation.

A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of used indices and updating `mex` accordingly while constructing the permutation.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
