Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a transition video plan such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear, regardless of the order of scenarios. The input provides a partially filled grid where some transitions are already decided ('F' or 'S'), and others are undecided ('?').

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and initializes arrays `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' in each column.
   - It then populates `sa` and `sb` lists with indices of columns that have more 'F' or 'S' respectively.
   - The logic to decide the values for '?' is flawed:
     - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, it tries to fill '?' with 'F' if the column index is in the top quarter of `sa`. Otherwise, it fills '?' with 'S'.
     - Similarly, if `len(sb) > len(sa)`, it tries to fill '?' with 'S' if the column index is in the top quarter of `sb`. Otherwise, it fills '?' with 'F'.
   - This approach does not guarantee that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will appear in any permutation of scenarios. The logic to fill '?' does not consider the overall sequence of transitions and the constraint of consecutive videos.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the first example, the program's output does not satisfy the constraint. For instance, if the scenarios are permuted such that the first four scenarios are all in the top quarter of `sa`, the first four transition videos would all be 'F', which violates the constraint.
   - In the second example, the program's output also fails to meet the constraint. For a specific permutation, the sequence might have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'S'.

Given the flaws in the logic to fill the '?' values and the failure to meet the constraint in the examples, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
