Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for ss in s:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ss`, `ans`, and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. The variable `ss` takes each character from `s` one by one.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is 0 (this is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `ans` is the string `ss` concatenated to the original `ans`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string with its first character `ss` processed.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `ss` is taking each character from `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` will be the next character in `s`.
   - `ans` will be updated by concatenating the next character `ss` to the current `ans`.
   - `s` will be the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character (which was processed).

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `cur` remains 0.
   - `ans` will be the current `ans` plus the next character `ss`.
   - `s` will be the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character.

Given the above reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character**.
