Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `x` is 0, `one` is False, and `lst[z]` is not an empty list**

Explanation: The initial value of `one` is `True`. The code `one = not one` changes the value of `one` to the opposite of its current value. Since `one` was initially `True`, it becomes `False`. The values of `z`, `tmp`, `x`, and `lst[z]` remain unchanged.
