Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`.
   - Additional conditions for updating `ans`: `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` must hold true.
   - If these conditions are met, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was increased by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `ans` will remain the same unless the conditions are met in the current iteration.

Given the above points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- The variable `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The condition for updating `ans` will be checked again with the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`, `i` is `i + 1`, and the conditions for updating `ans` are the same as before.**

Since the exact value of `i` and `ans` is not provided, we can represent it generally as:

**State: **`ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`, `i` is `i + 1`, and the conditions for updating `ans` are the same as before.**
