Output State: **`a` is equal to `num` modulo 10, `num` is now equal to `int(num / 10)`**

Explanation: The value of `a` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `a`. The code changes `num` to its integer division by 10, which means `num` is now `int(num / 10)`. The value of `a` is still equal to `num % 10` from the initial state.
