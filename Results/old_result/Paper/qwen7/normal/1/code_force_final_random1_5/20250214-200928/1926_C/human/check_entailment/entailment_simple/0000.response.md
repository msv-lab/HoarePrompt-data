Reasoning:
- The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
- The main part of the program initializes a list `A` to store the cumulative sums of the digits for numbers from 1 to 200,000. However, this initialization is unnecessary because the input values for `n` are within a smaller range (1 to 2 * 10^5), and the program can directly compute the required sum for each test case without precomputing all values up to 200,000.
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and printing the corresponding cumulative sum stored in `A[n - 1]`. This approach works because the cumulative sums are computed in order, and each sum is stored in the list `A`.

However, the main issue is that the program does not correctly handle the logic for computing the cumulative sums. Instead of storing the cumulative sums, it stores the sum of digits for each number up to 200,000, which is unnecessary and inefficient. Moreover, the program does not actually compute the cumulative sums in a way that would allow it to retrieve the correct sum for each test case efficiently.

To fix this, the program should compute the sum of digits for each number up to the maximum possible value of `n` for each test case and store these sums directly in a list or use a different approach to avoid redundant computations.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the cumulative sums and relies on an unnecessary and inefficient precomputation.

Correctness: **False**
