You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, sums these counts, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` becomes non-positive, indicating the end of iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` using the `count` method.
   - It then prints the sum of these counts.

### Problem Description Recap:
- A string is considered "ugly" if it contains either the substring "pie" or "map".
- To make the string "beautiful", we need to remove the minimum number of characters such that no "pie" or "map" substrings remain.
- The goal is to output the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Issues with the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and prints their sum.
   - This approach does not account for overlapping substrings or the need to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both "pie" and "map".

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the string "mmapnapie":
     - The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
     - It would print `1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct since deleting the 4th and 9th characters makes the string beautiful.
   - However, for more complex cases, this approach fails:
     - For "mappppie":
       - The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
       - It would print `1 + 1 = 2`, but actually, deleting only 2 characters (the 3rd and 7th) is sufficient to make the string beautiful.
     - For "ppiee":
       - The program would count 0 occurrences of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
       - It would print `0 + 1 = 1`, which is correct, but the optimal solution is to delete 2 characters (the 3rd and 5th).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the optimal removal of characters to eliminate both "pie" and "map" substrings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
