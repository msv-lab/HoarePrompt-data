Output State: **The program returns -1**

Given the initial state:
- `ind` is an empty list (since the condition `ind` is an empty list is true).
- `c` is equal to 2.
- `i` is equal to the index of the second element in `ind` + 1, but since `ind` is an empty list, there is no second element, so `i` would be `0 + 1 = 1`.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged as 14.

The code `return n - 1` implies that `n` should be considered as 14 (since `k` is 14 and the value remains unchanged). Therefore, the program returns `14 - 1`, which is `13 - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1`. 

Thus, the final output is **-1**.
