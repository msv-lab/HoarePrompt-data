Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `_` is 0, `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`**

Explanation: The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `y`, `_`, and `x`. It only updates `z` to be a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`. Additionally, `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
