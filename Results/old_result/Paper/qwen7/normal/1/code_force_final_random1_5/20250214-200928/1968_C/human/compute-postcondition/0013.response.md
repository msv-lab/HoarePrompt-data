Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, where `n` is a value that must be greater than or equal to itself.
- `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0] + x[0] + a[1] + x[1] + ... + a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

Let's break down the information:

1. `i` is set to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations.
2. `a[i]` is the sum of the series `a[0] + x[0] + a[1] + x[1] + ... + a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

Given that `a[0]` is initially 1000 and each subsequent `a[j]` (for `j > 0`) is added to the cumulative sum along with the corresponding `x[j-1]` from the list `x`, the final value of `a[i]` (which is `a[n-1]`) will be the sum of `a[0]` plus the sum of all elements in `x`.

Therefore, the list `a` will look like this:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
- `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + a[1] + x[1] = 1000 + x[0] + (1000 + x[0]) + x[1] = 2000 + 2*x[0] + x[1]`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = 1000 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (a[j] + x[j])`

The exact values of `x` are not provided, but the structure of `a` is clear. The final value of `a[i]` (which is `a[n-1]`) will be the sum described above.

Thus, the output will be the list `a` with the final value of `a[i]` being the cumulative sum as described.

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 2000 + 2*x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (a[j] + x[j])**
