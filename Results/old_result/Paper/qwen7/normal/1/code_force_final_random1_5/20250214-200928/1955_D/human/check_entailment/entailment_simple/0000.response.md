Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The code correctly initializes `cnt_b` with a size of `max_val + 1` (where `max_val = 1000000`). It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Occurrences of `b`'s Elements**: The code counts the occurrences of each element in `b` using `cnt_b`. This is done correctly.

3. **Sliding Window Approach**: The code uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`. It maintains a counter `curr` which keeps track of the number of elements from `a` that are also present in `b`. 

4. **Updating `curr` and `ans`**: 
   - When the current element in `a` is in `b`, it updates `curr` and `cnt_b`.
   - If `curr` reaches or exceeds `k`, it increments `ans`.
   - As the window slides, it correctly updates `curr` by removing the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element.

5. **Resetting `cnt_b`**: After processing all subsegments for a test case, `cnt_b` is reset for the next test case.

6. **Output**: The code prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the number of good subsegments.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to follow the problem statement correctly and handles the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
