Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
   - `i` is 0
   - `A`, `B`, `C` are integers entered by the user.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for the number of iterations specified by the user input.

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variables in the loop head are `i`.

4. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, after one iteration, `i` should be 1.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`A`, `B`, `C`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are determined by the user input before the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are only related to `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers entered by the user**
