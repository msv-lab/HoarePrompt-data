Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
