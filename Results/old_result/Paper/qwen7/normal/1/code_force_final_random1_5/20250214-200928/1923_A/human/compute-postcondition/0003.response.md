Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string created by joining the input string split by spaces, `_` is 0**

Explanation: The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` takes an input string, splits it into a list of words using spaces as delimiters, and then joins these words back together into a single string without any spaces. This new string is assigned to the variable `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` remains 0.
