Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is \(n - 8\), `k` is \(n - 9\), the first element of list `l` is equal to the second last element of list `l`, and the second last element of list `l` is the same as the first element.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated to `k - i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 8`, substituting this into the equation gives `k` as `n - 9`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
