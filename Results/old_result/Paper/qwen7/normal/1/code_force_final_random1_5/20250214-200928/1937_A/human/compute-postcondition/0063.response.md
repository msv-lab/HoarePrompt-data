Based on the initial state provided:

- `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `power` is less than `n` - 1.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

We need to determine the value of `2 ** power` to be printed.

Since `power` is less than `n - 1` and `n` is greater than 3, the maximum possible value for `power` is `n - 2`. However, without the exact value of `power`, we cannot specify a numerical value for `2 ** power`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 ** power (where power is a value less than n - 1 and n is greater than 3)**
