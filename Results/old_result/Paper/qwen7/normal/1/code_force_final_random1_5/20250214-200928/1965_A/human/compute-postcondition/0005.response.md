Output State: **`A` is False; `arr[0]` is 1; `set_` is [1]**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the elements in the set `set_`. Since `set_` initially contains only one element, 1, sorting does not change its content. Therefore, the values of `A` and `arr[0]` remain unchanged, and `set_` remains as `[1]`.
