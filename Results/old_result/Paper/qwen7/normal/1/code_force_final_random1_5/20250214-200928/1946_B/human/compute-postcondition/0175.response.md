Output State: **`sm` is now equal to 2 + `suf[n]`**

Explanation: The initial value of `sm` is 2. The code `sm += suf[n]` adds the value of `suf[n]` to the current value of `sm`. Since the exact value of `suf[n]` is not provided, it remains as `suf[n]` in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged.
