Output State: **`i` is len(a) - 1, `bd` will still hold the differences as calculated, `v` will be a list of length len(a) where the first element is 0 and the rest are the results of dividing corresponding elements of `ad` by `bd`, `t` is len(a), `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The other variables (`i`, `bd`, `v`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
