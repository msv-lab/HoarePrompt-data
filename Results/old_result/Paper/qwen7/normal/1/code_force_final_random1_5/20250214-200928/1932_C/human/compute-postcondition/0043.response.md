Output State: `p` is the product of all elements in the list `b` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing all the intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop from the first to the last, with each value being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point modulo `m`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `p` will hold the final result of multiplying all elements in the list `b` together and taking the result modulo `m`. The list `ans` will contain a sequence of these cumulative products, starting from the first element of `b` and ending with the product of all elements in `b`.
