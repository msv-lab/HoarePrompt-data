The function calculates and returns a list of missing values for each test case. For each test case, it computes the missing number of problems Vlad needs to create based on the given parameters `n`, `m`, and the string `a`. Specifically, it counts the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`, then determines how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement `m` for each difficulty level. The result is a list of these missing values for all test cases.
