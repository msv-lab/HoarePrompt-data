Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`, where `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until `x % i == 0`. If such an `i` is found and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is set to `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` remains as 2. `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `sqrt(x)` must be an integer or a float that allows the range to include integers from 1 up to and including the integer part of the square root of `x` + 1.
