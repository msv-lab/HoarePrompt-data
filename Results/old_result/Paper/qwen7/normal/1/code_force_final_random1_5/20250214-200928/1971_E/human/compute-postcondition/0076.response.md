Output State: **`i` is set to `len(a)`, `q` is still equal to `len(a)`, `l` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The initial values of `i`, `q`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `k`, and `q` are now known integers based on user input.
