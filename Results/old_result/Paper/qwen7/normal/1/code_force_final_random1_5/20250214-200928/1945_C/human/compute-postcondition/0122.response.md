Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2
   - `zero_perc` is either 0, 100, or 50
   - `one` is 2
   - `one_perc` is -200 * (o - 2) // (n - 1)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1. However, since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 1`, if `n` were 1, the loop would not run at all. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to run at least once.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `zero_perc` is either 0, 100, or 50, `one` is 2, and `one_perc` is -200 * (o - 2) // (n - 1)**
