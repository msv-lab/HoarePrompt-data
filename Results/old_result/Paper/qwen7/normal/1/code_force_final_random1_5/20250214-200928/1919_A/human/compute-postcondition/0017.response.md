Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the value of `winner`.
- `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer.
- `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer.
- `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the value stored in the `results` list. Since `results` is a list with `t` elements, all of which are the value of `winner`, the print statement will output the value of `winner`.

To summarize, the `winner` is determined by the function `func_1(a, b)`, and this value is repeated `t` times in the `results` list. Therefore, the print statement will output this value `t` times.

Output: **winner (where winner is the result of func_1(a, b))**
