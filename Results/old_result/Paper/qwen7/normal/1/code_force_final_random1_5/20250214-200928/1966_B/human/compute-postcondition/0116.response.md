Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `m` is greater than 1
   - `n` is at least 2
   - `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user
   - `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`
   - `impossible` remains `False`
   - `j` is `m-2`

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute again**: The loop will execute again if `i < n`. Given that `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again because `i` is not less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, we don't need to change `i` or `n`.
   - The other variables (`m`, `gr`, `ans`, `impossible`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case won't happen) would be the same as the current state since the loop does not execute again.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`, `impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`**
