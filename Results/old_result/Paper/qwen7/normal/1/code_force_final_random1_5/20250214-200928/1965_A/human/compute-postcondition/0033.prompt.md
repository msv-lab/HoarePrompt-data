You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: A is False, arr[0] is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 3, `not_c` is False.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(set_) - 1`. Given that `set_` is initially `[1]`, the length of `set_` is 1. Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i = 0`, which means it won't actually run at all because the range starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) 1. However, based on the provided information, we can infer that the loop has been executed 3 times. Since the loop breaks when `not_c` becomes False and `A` toggles with each iteration, after 3 iterations, `A` would be True (since it started as False and toggled 3 times), `i` would be 2 (as the loop increments `i` but stops before reaching the next index), and `not_c` remains False. The array `arr` and set `set_` do not change during the loop, so they remain as initially stated.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns 'Alice' in both cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
