To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is 1.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(b[s], end=' ')`.

Given the initial state, the key part is understanding the value of `s`. The value of `s` is determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`. However, without knowing the exact values of `a` and `ql`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. But we know that `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which returns the index where `ql` should be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.

Since we don't have the exact values of `a` and `ql`, we can only describe `s` as the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The print statement will print the value of `b[s]`, where `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **b[bisect_left(a, ql)]**
