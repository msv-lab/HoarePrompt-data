Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is updated to the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains 'YES', `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` inserts `l` into the list `v1` in a way that maintains the list's sorted order and returns the index where `l` should be inserted. The values of `q`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `results`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
