Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `pow` is 4, `tot` is incremented by 8**.

Explanation: The variable `pow` is initially set to 2. The line `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2, resulting in `pow` becoming 4. The values of `a`, `L`, and `tot` remain unchanged from their initial states.
