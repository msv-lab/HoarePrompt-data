Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `t` is an input integer (this variable is not involved in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `v` is an input integer (this variable is not involved in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `start` is equal to `v`.
   - `end` is equal to `v`.
   - `num` is a list containing `[v]` (this variable is not involved in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)**.
