Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `m-1`, `impossible` is True if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `j` ranges from 0 to `m-2`), the final value of `j` will be `m-1`. The variable `impossible` will be set to `False` only if there is no position `j` where the conditions `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]` are satisfied during any iteration of the loop. If such a position is found at any point, `impossible` is set to `True` and the loop exits early. Therefore, after all iterations, `impossible` will be `True` if any of these conditions are met at any `j`, otherwise it will remain `False`.
