Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped.
   - `obj` is an element from the `command` list.
   - `com` is an element from the `command` list.
   - `el` is an element from the `command` list.
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `time` is explicitly given as 2.
- `team` depends on the first character of `obj`. Since `obj` is an element from the `command` list, it could be any string, but we need to determine `team` based on the first character of `obj`.

Given that `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`:
- If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
- Otherwise, `team` is 0.

However, since `GoalName` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `GoalName[team]`. We only know that `GoalName` is a list of strings, and `team` is either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **2 GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH** (where `team` is either 0 or 1, and `GoalName[team]` is the corresponding element from the `GoalName` list).
