### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array `a` after adding a permutation `p` to each element of `a`. This means we need to find a permutation such that the resulting array has the highest frequency of any single number.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads an integer from input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads space-separated integers from input.
   - `func_3()`: Converts the output of `func_2()` into a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Sorts the list of integers obtained from `func_3()`.
   - `func_5()`: Reads space-separated strings from input.
   - `func_6()`: Reads a string and converts it into a list of characters.
   - `func_7()`: Reads a string, converts it into a list of characters, and sorts it.
   - `func_8()`: Computes the prefix product of the input list.
   - `func_9()`: Computes the suffix product of the input list.

3. **Identifying the Relevant Function**:
   - The relevant function for solving the problem is `func_4()`, which sorts the list of integers. However, the rest of the code does not utilize this function correctly.

4. **Provided Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the length of the array (`n`) for each test case.
   - It then creates a sorted list of unique elements from the input array.
   - The code uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position where the elements would fit in the sorted list after adding `n` to them.
   - The difference between the position in the sorted list and the current index gives the count of elements that can be mapped to the current element in the sorted list.
   - The maximum of these counts is printed as the result.

5. **Correctness of the Provided Code**:
   - The logic in the code is sound. By sorting the unique elements and using binary search, it correctly identifies the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.
   - The code handles the problem as described in the problem statement and provides the correct solution.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It reads the input, processes it, and outputs the correct result.
