Output State: **`nx` is either 'SSF' or 'FSF', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with the string 'S'. Since `nx` was either 'S' or 'F', after adding 'S', `nx` becomes either 'SS' or 'FS'. The value of `i` remains `n + 1`, `n` must still be at least 1, and `j` remains 3.
