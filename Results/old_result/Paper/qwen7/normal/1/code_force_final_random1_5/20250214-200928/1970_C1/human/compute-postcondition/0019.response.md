Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `lst[tmp] != []`.
2. **Identify the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `lst[tmp]` and `[]`.
3. **Determine the current state of the variables**:
   - `z` is an input integer.
   - `tmp` is equal to `z`.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `one` is True.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list (`[]`).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `tmp` is equal to `z`, we need to ensure that `lst[z]` is not an empty list.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure that `lst[z]` is not an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `x` is 0, `one` is True, and `lst[z]` is not an empty list**
