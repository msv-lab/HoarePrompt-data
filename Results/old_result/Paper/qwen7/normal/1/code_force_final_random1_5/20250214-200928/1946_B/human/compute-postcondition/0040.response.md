Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 0, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is `suf[0] - smin[0]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` to `sm`. Given that `i` is 0, `suf[0]` is the first element of the `suf` list, and `smin[0]` is 0 (since `smin` starts with 0). Therefore, `sm` is calculated as `suf[0] - 0`, which simplifies to `suf[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
