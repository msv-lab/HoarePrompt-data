Output State: **`t` is `t + n`, `aOnes` remains either 0 or 1, `bOnes` remains equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` remains `k + 1`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The other variables (`t`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
