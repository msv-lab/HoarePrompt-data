Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; the current value of `x` is 0, and `results` contains 'YES'.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `idx` is increased by 2 is still valid, and the value of `x` and the contents of `results` also remain as they were.
