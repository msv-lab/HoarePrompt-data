Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `j` is 0; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers, assigning them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `m` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, `m` must still be greater than 0 and `j` is still 0. The values of `x` and `y` are the integers obtained from the input.
