You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration; `arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces for each iteration; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` for the last iteration; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]` for the last iteration; `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y` for the last iteration; `_` is `t-1` (indicating the loop has completed `t-1` iterations); `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` for the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within the range 1 to 1000, `n` will be the integer input for the last iteration, `arr` will be the string for the last iteration, `x` will be the index of the first '1' in `arr` from the last iteration, `y` will be the index of the first '1' from the end in `arr` from the last iteration, `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n-y` from the last iteration, `_` will indicate the loop has run `t-1` times, and `x` will be the index of the first '1' in `arr` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n binary values. It then finds the first occurrence of '1' from the start and the end of the binary string, extracts the substring between these occurrences, and counts the number of zeros in this substring. The function prints the count of zeros for each test case and returns nothing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where chips are scattered in such a way that moving them requires more than just moving the last chip to the nearest free cell to the left.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The correct output should be `1`, as moving the last chip to the 5th cell will result in all chips being together. However, the program's logic is flawed because it only checks the first occurrence of '1' and the last occurrence of '1' in the string representation of the array, which does not account for the optimal sequence of moves.

A correct approach would involve counting the number of free cells between consecutive chips and summing these counts, as this represents the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together.
