Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by `(n + i) // (i * i)`; `n` must satisfy the condition `i^2 + i <= n`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` to its current value. The precondition that `n` must satisfy the condition `i^2 + i <= n` remains valid. The values of `i` and `ans` are updated, but the specific values of `n` that satisfy the condition are not altered by the code.
