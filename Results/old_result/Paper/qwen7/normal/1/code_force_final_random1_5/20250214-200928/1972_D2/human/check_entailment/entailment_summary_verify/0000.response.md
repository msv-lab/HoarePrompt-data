### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the function summaries and the problem description.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   
2. **Main Loop:**
   - The outer loop iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
   - The inner loop iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - The condition `(x + y) * x <= n` ensures that `x` and `y` are within the bounds of `n`.
   - The condition `(x + y) * y <= m` ensures that `y` is within the bounds of `m`.

3. **GCD Check and Count Calculation:**
   - If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, the function checks if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The count is updated by adding the minimum value of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The total count of valid pairs is printed after the loops complete.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop Over Test Cases:**
   - The function calls `func_1()` exactly `t` times, handling each test case independently.

#### Function Summaries:

- **Function 2 Summary:**
  - The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
  - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` exactly once.
  - After processing all test cases, `t` is set to 0.

Given the problem description and the function summaries, let's verify the correctness of the implementation:

1. **Bounds Checking:**
   - The program correctly checks the bounds for `x` and `y` using the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - This ensures that the values of `x` and `y` remain within the specified ranges.

2. **GCD and Condition Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` before performing the condition check.
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is checked using the division operations `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

3. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. The logic within `func_1` ensures that all conditions are checked appropriately, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summaries.
