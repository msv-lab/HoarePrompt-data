Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` was initially set to 1 and lists in Python are zero-indexed, `i` is incremented by the code, making it 2. Therefore, `ad` now contains `[0, a[2] - a[1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
