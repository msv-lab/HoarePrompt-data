Output State: **The maximum value among `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n` is stored in `sm`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `sm` will hold the highest value found among the differences `suf[i] - smin[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n`. This is because the loop updates `sm` whenever it finds a larger difference than the current value of `sm` or if `sm` was initially -111. Since the loop iterates through all possible values of `i` from 0 to `n`, `sm` will eventually store the maximum difference encountered.
