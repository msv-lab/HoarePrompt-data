Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1` (so `n > 4`), `zero` is 1, `one` is 3, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [3]**.

Explanation: The variable `one` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
