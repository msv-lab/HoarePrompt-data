Postcondition: **`aOnes` is 2 if `i` is in both `a` and `b` and the number of ones in `a` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `aOnes` is 1. `bOnes` is 0 or 1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces. `i` is increased by 1 and must be such that `i <= k`. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` remains as 1 (or 0 if previously), `bOnes` remains unchanged, and `i` is still incremented by 1 and remains within the specified range.**
