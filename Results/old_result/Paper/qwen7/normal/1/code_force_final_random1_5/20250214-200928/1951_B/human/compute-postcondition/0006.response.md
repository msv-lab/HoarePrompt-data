Output State: **`ind` is a list containing the integer `i`, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `x` is the `k`-th element of list `a`, `c` is 0, and the current value of `i` is such that `a[i] > x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ind`. Since `i` was previously such that `a[i] > x`, this condition still holds. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
