Output State: **`count_num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the second element in `num`, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3.**

Explanation: The variable `count_num` is incremented by 1. Since `count_num` was either 0 or 1 initially, it now becomes either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
