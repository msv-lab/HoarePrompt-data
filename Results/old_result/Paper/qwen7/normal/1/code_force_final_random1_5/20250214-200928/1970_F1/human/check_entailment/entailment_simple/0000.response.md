Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`), initializes the grid, and populates the `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points` data structures. The logic here is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Action Processing Loop**: The program processes each action in the sequence provided. It correctly handles movements, catching the Quaffle, and throwing it. The logic for updating the `elements` dictionary and checking for valid moves is correct.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player scores by placing the Quaffle in the opposing team's goal, the appropriate message is printed, and the points are updated. The program correctly identifies when a player scores in the wrong goal and prints the correct team as the winner.

4. **Final Score Calculation**: The final score is calculated correctly after processing all actions, and the output format is as specified.

5. **Helper Functions**: The helper functions `goalIn` and `isPlayer` are implemented correctly and used appropriately in the main logic.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately.

Correctness: **True**
