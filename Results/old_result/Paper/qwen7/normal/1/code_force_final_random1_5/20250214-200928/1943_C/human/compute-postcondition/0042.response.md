The code `break` is executed, which does not affect any variable values but indicates that we break out of the current loop or the most internal loop or if statement we are inside. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[-1, n]`, and `n` is set to the value of `previous[-1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
