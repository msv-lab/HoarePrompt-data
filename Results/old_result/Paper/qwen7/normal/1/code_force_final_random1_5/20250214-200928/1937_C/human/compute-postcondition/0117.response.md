Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop condition `range(1, n)` requires `n` to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head.

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `best` is 0 (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `n` is greater than 4 (relevant, but needs to be checked against the loop condition).
   - `i` is equal to `n` (not relevant to the loop execution as `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head).
   - `k` is equal to `n-1` (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `res` is an input string (not relevant to the loop execution).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Given that `n` is already stated to be greater than 4, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than 1, which is already satisfied by the given condition that `n` is greater than 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
