Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to decode a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and then reads the string `b` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.

3. **Issues in `func_1`**:
   - **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` attempts to decode the string by replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `unique_chars`. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed.
   - **Modifying String While Iterating**: The function tries to modify the string `s` while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.
   - **Incorrect Symmetric Replacement**: The function does not correctly implement the symmetric replacement logic. It should map each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars`, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Create the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b` by identifying distinct characters and sorting them alphabetically.
   - Create a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - Use this mapping to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the decoding logic.

Correctness: **False**
