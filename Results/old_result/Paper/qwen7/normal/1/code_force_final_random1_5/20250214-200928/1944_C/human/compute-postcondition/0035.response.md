Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of non-negative integers. Each integer in the list satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), with \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\). The function does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.**
