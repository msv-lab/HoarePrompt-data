Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input separated by spaces and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, while `n`, `k`, and `q` are the integers obtained from the input.
