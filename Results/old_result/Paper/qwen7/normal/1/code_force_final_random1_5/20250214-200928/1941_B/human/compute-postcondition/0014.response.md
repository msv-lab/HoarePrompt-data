Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.
- `a` is then assigned the value of the new input integer.
- `b` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the latest input string split on spaces and converted to integers.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
