Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
