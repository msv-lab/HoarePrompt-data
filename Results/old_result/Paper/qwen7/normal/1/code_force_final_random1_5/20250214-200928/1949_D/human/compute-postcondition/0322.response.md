Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 3. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' and `xx[i][2]` is '?' as per the else part.
