Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / count)`**.

This means that the value of `g` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`, which is 2. So, `g` is `int(n / 2)`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
