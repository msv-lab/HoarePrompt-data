Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be at least 1 (though this does not affect the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
