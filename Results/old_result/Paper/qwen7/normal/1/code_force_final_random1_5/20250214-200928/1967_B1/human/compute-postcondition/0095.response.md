Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is `count + 1`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is `int(count - 1)`, `g` is `int(n / count) - int(count - 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values. The updated value of `count` is used in the expressions for `ans` and `countmins`.
