Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1`, `mex` will be `mex - len(ar)*ar[-1] + sum(ar)`, and `res` will be a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` from `-1` to `n-1`**.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1` because the loop starts from `-len(ar)` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. The value of `mex` will be adjusted by subtracting twice the current `mex` and adding the current `ar[i]` for each iteration, resulting in `mex - len(ar)*ar[-1] + sum(ar)`. The `res` list will be filled starting from index `-1` up to the original length of `ar`, with each element set to `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding `i` value.
