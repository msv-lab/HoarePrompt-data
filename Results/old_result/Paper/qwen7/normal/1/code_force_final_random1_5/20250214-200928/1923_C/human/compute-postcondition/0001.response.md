Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer in the initial state.
