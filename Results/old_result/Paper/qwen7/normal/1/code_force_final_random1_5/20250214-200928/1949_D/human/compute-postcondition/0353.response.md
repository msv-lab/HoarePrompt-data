Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and the condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` and `sb` remain unchanged.
