Postcondition: `aOnes` is the number of occurrences of `i` in list `a`. `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces. `i` is 1. `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 2, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not present in `a` or `b`, or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then `aOnes` remains 0. If `i` is present in `b` and `bOnes` is less than `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1.
