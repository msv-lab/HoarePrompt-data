Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `na_frente` to `-1` in reverse order (decrementing by 1 each time).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `na_frente` is an input integer minus 1.
   - `v` is `v - 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `c` is 2.
   - `total` is updated based on conditions involving `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
   - `best` is either updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if certain conditions are met, or remains 10000000000.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `v` by 1, `v` will be reduced by 1 from its current value.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop body.

5. **Update the `total` and `best` values**:
   - The `total` and `best` values depend on the conditions inside the loop. However, since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to explicitly state the updated values of `total` and `best` unless they are directly involved in the loop head (which they are not in this case).

6. **Construct the new state**:
   - `na_frente` remains the same.
   - `v` is decreased by 1 from its previous value.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is `v - 2`, `c` is 2**.
