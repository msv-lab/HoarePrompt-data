Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is now the last element of the new list `s`, `h` remains as the last element of the original list (first element of the swapped list), `z` remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to int, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to int, the first and the k-th elements of the list `s` have been swapped.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `h`, `z`, `n`, `k`, or the list `s`. The first and the k-th elements of the list `s` have already been swapped, and `i` is set to the last element of the new list `s`. The values of `h` and `z` remain unchanged as they were before the swap operation. The values of `n` and `k` remain as the integers obtained from the input split and converted to int.
