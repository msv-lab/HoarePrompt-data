Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `opNum`, and `stop` is `True`; `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts each integer into a list. This changes the value of `a` to a new list of integers, but does not affect the values of `i`, `opNum`, `a[n - 2]`, `a[n - 1]`, or `stop`. The precondition that either the last element of `a` is not 0 or the second last element of `a` is not 0, or both elements are 0, remains valid.
