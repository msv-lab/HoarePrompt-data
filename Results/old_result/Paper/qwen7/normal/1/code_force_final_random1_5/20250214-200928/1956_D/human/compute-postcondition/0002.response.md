Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function `func_2(a)` to three variables `s`, `m`, and `ops`. Since the function `func_2` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `s`, `m`, and `ops`. However, we know that `n` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of `n` integers within the specified range, and `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the outputs of the function.
