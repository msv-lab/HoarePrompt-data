Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, `j` is `m + 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` is an integer greater than `m + 1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d1` as a defaultdict with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `d1` is now a dictionary where any key that does not exist will automatically be assigned an integer value (0 by default). The other variables (`m`, `x`, `y`, `j`, `d2`, `n`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
