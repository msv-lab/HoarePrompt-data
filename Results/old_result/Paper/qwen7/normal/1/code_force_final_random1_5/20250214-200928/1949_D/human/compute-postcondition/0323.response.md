Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is at least 4.
   - `j` is 3.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the current value of `j` is 3.
   - The next value of `j` will be `j = 4`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `nx` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes it, but we cannot assume anything about its value without seeing the loop body.
   - `i` remains `n + 1` because `i` is not involved in the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged because `n` is not involved in the loop head.
   - `j` changes to 4.

6. **Final State**:
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is at least 4.
   - `j` is 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 4**.
