Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing k operations. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `sm` does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. 

The program attempts to use a suffix sum array (`suf`) and a minimum suffix sum array (`smin`) to find the maximum possible sum. However, the calculation of `sm` as `2 ** k * sm - sm` and the subsequent adjustments do not align with the problem statement. The intended approach should involve using the subarray sums and the operations to maximize the array sum, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

A counterexample where the program fails is as follows:

Input:
```
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```

Expected output:
```
-1
```

However, the program outputs a much larger value, indicating that it does not correctly handle the case where the array elements are negative and the goal is to minimize the sum rather than maximize it.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
