Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `tc` is equal to `tc` - 1
  - `i` is equal to `n`
  - `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`
  - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1
  - `len(arr)` must be greater than 1

- The loop condition:
  ```
  while tc > 0:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `tc > 0`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `tc` has been decremented by 1 in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Given that `tc` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `tc` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `tc` is set to a value that satisfies this condition.

### Adjusting the State:
- Since `tc` was decremented by 1, for the loop to execute again, `tc` must be greater than 0. This means that `tc` should be set to a value that is still greater than 0.

### Final State:
- `tc` must be greater than 0.
- No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

### Answer:
State: **`tc` must be greater than 0**
