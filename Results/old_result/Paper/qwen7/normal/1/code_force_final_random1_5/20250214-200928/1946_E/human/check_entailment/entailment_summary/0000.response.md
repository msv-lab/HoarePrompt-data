Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. The solution uses factorials and combinatorial calculations to determine the number of valid permutations.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - **Factorials Calculation**: The `facts` list is precomputed to store factorials up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **Combinatorial Function (`func_2`)**: This function calculates combinations using the extended Euclidean algorithm (`func_1`) to handle large numbers efficiently.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - Checks if the first and last elements of the prefix and suffix maximums match the constraints.
     - Uses combinatorial calculations to count the number of valid permutations based on the gaps between the maximums.

3. **Verification of Each Part**:
   - **Factorials Calculation**: The `facts` list is correctly precomputed.
   - **Combinatorial Function (`func_2`)**: The function correctly computes combinations using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - The logic checks if the first and last elements of the prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with the permutation requirements.
     - It correctly calculates the number of valid permutations by considering the gaps between the maximums and using combinatorial methods.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The solution handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when the first or last elements do not match the required conditions, resulting in zero valid permutations.
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the results fit within standard integer limits.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
