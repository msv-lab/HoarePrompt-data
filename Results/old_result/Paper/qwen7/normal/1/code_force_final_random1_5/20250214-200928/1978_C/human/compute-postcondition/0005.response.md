Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}; `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)` and is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = func_1(n, k)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `k`, and assigns the return value of `func_1` to `l`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `l`. However, we know that `l` is an integer because `func_1` returns an integer. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
