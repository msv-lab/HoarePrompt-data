Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` and processes it using a counter to track the frequency of each number. It iterates through the numbers, marking them as visited and decrementing their counts. If it finds a sequence where the next number exists and is not yet visited, it moves to the next number. Otherwise, it prints the current number and terminates. The function does not return any value.**
