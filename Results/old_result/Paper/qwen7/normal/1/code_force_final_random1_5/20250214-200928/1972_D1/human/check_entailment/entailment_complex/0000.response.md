Reasoning:  
The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy specific conditions. Let's analyze the functions to ensure they collectively meet the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - `func_1()`: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a map of integers from standard input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads and returns a list of two integers from standard input.
   - `func_4(rows_number)`: Calls `func_3()` `rows_number` times and returns a list of pairs.
   - `func_5()`: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - `func_6()`: Reads a line from standard input, strips trailing whitespace, and decodes it.
   - `func_7()`: Reads and returns a list of integers from standard input.
   - `func_8(rows)`: Calls `func_7()` `rows` times and returns a list of lists.
   - `func_9()`: Reads input from standard input.
   - `func_10()`: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - `func_11()`: Reads a line from standard input and splits it.

2. **Core Functionality**:
   - `func_12()`: Implements a recursive function using the concept of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the minimum value of a specific condition.
   - `func_13()`: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and BÃ©zout coefficients.
   - `func_14()`: Checks if a list of integers meets certain conditions.
   - `func_15()`: Calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_16()`: Processes multiple test cases, reading \(t\) test cases and calling `func_15()` for each pair \((n, m)\).

3. **Problem-Solving Approach**:
   - The core logic is implemented in `func_15()`, which calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_16()` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases, ensuring that the solution is applied to each test case as required.

Given that:
- `func_15()` correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
- `func_16()` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

Therefore, the program is correct in terms of functionality and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
