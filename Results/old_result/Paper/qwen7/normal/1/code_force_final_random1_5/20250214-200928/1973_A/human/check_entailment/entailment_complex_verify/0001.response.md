### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and `cas_de_test` with predefined test cases. This part is correct and serves as input for the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case and calculates the total points and total matches.
   - It checks if the total points are even, which is necessary because each match contributes either 2 points (to the winners) or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - It then calculates the total number of matches from the total points.
   - It checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 (since there are only 3 players) or if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total number of matches, which would be impossible.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula derived from the points distribution.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating an invalid configuration.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the list of results, which are then printed.

### Analysis:

- **Total Points Check**:
  - The check for `total_points % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points are even, which is necessary for the points distribution to be valid.
  - However, this check alone is insufficient. For example, consider the case `(0, 0, 3)`. Here, `total_points = 3` which is odd, but it is still possible to achieve this score with 1 match (a win for the player with 3 points and a draw for the other two).

- **Total Matches Calculation**:
  - The calculation of `total_matchs = total_points // 2` correctly determines the total number of matches.
  - This is correct as long as the total points are even.

- **Match Constraints**:
  - The checks `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` ensure that the number of matches and the highest score are feasible.
  - These constraints are necessary but not sufficient. For instance, consider the case `(1, 1, 2)`. Here, `total_points = 4`, `total_matchs = 2`, and `p3 = 2`, which seems valid initially, but the calculation of `egalites` might not be correct.

- **Draw Calculation**:
  - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and the subsequent division by 2 correctly calculates the number of draws.
  - However, this formula might not always yield the correct number of draws. For example, in the case `(1, 1, 2)`, the correct number of draws should be 0, but the formula might incorrectly suggest a non-zero value.

### Specific Test Cases Analysis:

- **Case (0, 0, 0)**:
  - Correct output: 0
  - Explanation: No games were played, so no draws.

- **Case (0, 1, 1)**:
  - Correct output: 1
  - Explanation: One draw between the second and third player.

- **Case (0, 2, 3)**:
  - Incorrect in the original code: -1
  - Explanation: The original code incorrectly flags this as invalid, but it is valid with 2 draws.

- **Case (3, 3, 3)**:
  - Incorrect in the original code: -1
  - Explanation: The original code incorrectly flags this as invalid, but it is valid with 3 draws.

- **Case (3, 4, 5)**:
  - Incorrect in the original code: -1
  - Explanation: The original code incorrectly flags this as invalid, but it is valid with 6 draws.

- **Case (1, 1, 10)**:
  - Correct output: 2
  - Explanation: Two draws between the first and second player, and one win for the third player.

- **Case (0, 0, 6)**:
  - Correct output: 6
  - Explanation: Six draws.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because it does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the formula for calculating the number of draws might not always yield the correct result, leading to incorrect outputs for some valid configurations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
