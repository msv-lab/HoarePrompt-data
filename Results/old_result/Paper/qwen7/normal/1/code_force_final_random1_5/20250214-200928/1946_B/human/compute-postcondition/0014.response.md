Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is [0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[t-1] + l[t-1]], `n` is `t`, `i` is `t`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` remains unchanged (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4), `j` remains 0, `b` and `k` remain as they were initially (based on the input string), `l` also remains the same list of integers derived from the input string. The list `suf` now contains `t` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `l`. The variable `n` is set to `t`, and the loop variable `i` is equal to `t` indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
