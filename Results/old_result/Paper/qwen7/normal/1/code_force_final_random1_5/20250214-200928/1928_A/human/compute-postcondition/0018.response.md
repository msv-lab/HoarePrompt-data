Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first input integer from the split, `b` is the second input integer from the split.**

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings. These strings are then converted to integers and assigned to `a` and `b`. The variable `i` remains unchanged with its initial value of 1, and `t` remains as the new input integer within the specified range.
