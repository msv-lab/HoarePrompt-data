Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. The current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip any remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values by the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
