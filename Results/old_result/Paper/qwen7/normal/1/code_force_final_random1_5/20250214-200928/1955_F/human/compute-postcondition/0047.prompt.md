Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) represents the count of numbers in the sequence that are equal to 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, where the total number of elements in the sequence is p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and each of these elements is an odd integer, `cnt` is the sum of 1 and the floor division of each element in `a` (from the first to the last) by 2.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` remains a list with its first three elements being equal and odd integers, while `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `a`, effectively being the total count of such increments.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in `a`. The value of `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 during each iteration of the loop. Initially, `cnt` is set to 1 if the first three elements of `a` are equal and each of these elements is an odd number; otherwise, `cnt` starts at 0. After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will contain the total sum of the floor divisions of all elements in `a` by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers with a length equal to the input value, and the first three elements of `a` (if they exist) are either all the same and an odd number or not, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the updated `a`. If `a[0]` equals `a[1]` equals `a[2]` and `a[0]` is an odd number, then `cnt` is incremented by 3 (since the loop has executed 3 times), otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
