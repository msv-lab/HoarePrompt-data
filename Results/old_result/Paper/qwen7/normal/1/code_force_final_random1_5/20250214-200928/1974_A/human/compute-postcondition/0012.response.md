The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means `x` and `y` are now specific integers, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `t`, `a`, and `i` is preserved, and `x` and `y` are updated to the new values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), where \(m = 15 \cdot \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y \cdot 4\), and `x` and `y` are now specific integers obtained from the input.**
