Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will depend on the values of `t`, `k`, and the list `l`. However, based on the given information, we can infer the following:

- The variable `sm` will be calculated as described in the loop logic.
- If `sm` is less than 0, it will be adjusted to 9999999995.
- Otherwise, `sm` will be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- After the loop completes, `sm` will be adjusted further based on its value: if `sm` is less than 0, it will be set to 9999999995; otherwise, it will be taken modulo 10.

Given the specific output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce that the final value of `sm` will be 9999999995 if `sm` is less than 0, and otherwise, it will be the remainder of `sm` when divided by 10.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: **The value of `sm` will be either 9999999995 if it is less than 0, or the remainder of `sm` when divided by 10 otherwise.**
