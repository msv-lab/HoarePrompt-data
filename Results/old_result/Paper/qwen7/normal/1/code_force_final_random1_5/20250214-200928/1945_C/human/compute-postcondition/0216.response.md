Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `lst` contains at least one element.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and no specific element is mentioned to be removed or modified, `lst` should still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `mini` is updated based on the current value and the new element `ele` in each iteration. Therefore, `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `lst` must still contain at least one element.
   - `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**
