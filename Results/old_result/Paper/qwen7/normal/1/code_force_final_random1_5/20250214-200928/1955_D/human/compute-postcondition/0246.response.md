Postcondition: `i` is in the range 0 to `m-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is now `n - m + len(b) + 1`, and if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and has been decremented by 1; otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.
