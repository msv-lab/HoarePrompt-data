### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Function 1 Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
2. **Inner Loop**: Iterates over \(y\) starting from 1 until \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
3. **GCD Check**: If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it checks if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). This is done using the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).
4. **Count Calculation**: If the condition is satisfied, it adds the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\) to the count.

#### Function 2 Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

1. **Main Loop**: Iterates over \(t\) test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotated code provides insights into the state of the program at key points, but there are some inaccuracies in the annotations:

1. **Outer Loop Condition**: The annotation states that the loop stops when `x * x > n`, which is correct.
2. **Inner Loop Condition**: The annotation states that `y` remains 4, which is incorrect. The inner loop should continue as long as \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
3. **Final State**: The annotation states that `t` is 0, which is incorrect. `t` is the number of test cases, and the program should handle each test case correctly.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and checks the conditions for valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- The use of the GCD check ensures that the pairs meet the required condition.
- The use of the `min` function ensures that the count is calculated correctly based on the constraints.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correct and handles all the necessary conditions and constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the solution for the given problem.
