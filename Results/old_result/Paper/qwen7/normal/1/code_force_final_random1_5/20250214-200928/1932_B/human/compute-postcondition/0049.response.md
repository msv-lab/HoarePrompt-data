Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year - ai`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`, `ai` is `ai_next`, `test_cases` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` to be `current_year + ai`. Since `ai` is equal to `ai_next`, `next_year` becomes `current_year + ai_next`. As a result, `next_year` is now `current_year + ai`, and `current_year` is equal to `next_year - ai`. The values of `ai` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
