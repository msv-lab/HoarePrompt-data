Output State: **`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `A[l]` to the variable `a`. This means `a` now holds the value of `A[l]`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain as they were described in the previous state, with `i` being incremented by 1 if it was not 0, `n` remaining greater than 0, and `r` being decreased by 1.
