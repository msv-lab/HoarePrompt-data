Output State: **The program returns a list named `resultats` which contains the results for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, the program calculates `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs = total_points // 2`, and `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Depending on certain conditions, the list `resultats` appends either `-1` or `egalites // 2` to itself. If any condition fails during the iteration, `-1` is appended; otherwise, `egalites // 2` is appended.**

This means the final `resultats` list will consist of either `-1` or the integer division of `egalites` by 2 for each tuple in `cas_de_test`, based on the specified conditions.
