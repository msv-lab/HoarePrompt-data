Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is derived from the expression `n-1` (since `j` is `n-1`).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` is derived from `j`, which is `n-1`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is within the range of the loop, which means `i` should be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
