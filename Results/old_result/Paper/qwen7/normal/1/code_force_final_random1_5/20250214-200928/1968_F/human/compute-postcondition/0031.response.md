Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. This means the loop will run `n` times.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `i`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `idx` was increased by `1` at the end of the previous iteration, so it will be `idx + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `pf[n]` is calculated as `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`.
   - `mp[pf[n]]` will be updated to include the new index `n + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a[i]` (now `a[n + 1]`) will be the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`.
   - `idx` will be `idx + 1`.
   - `pf[i]` (now `pf[n + 1]`) will be `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`.
   - `mp[pf[n + 1]]` will be a list containing the index `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `pf[i]` is `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `n + 1`**.
