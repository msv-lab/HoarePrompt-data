Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the test cases and the result list.
2. The function `func_1` iterates over each test case and performs the necessary calculations to determine the maximum number of draws.
3. The logic for determining the maximum number of draws is as follows:
   - Check if the total points are odd. If so, append `-1` and continue to the next test case.
   - Calculate the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) from the total points.
   - Ensure that the total number of matches is not greater than 3 and that the highest score (`p3`) does not exceed the total number of matches. If either condition fails, append `-1` and continue.
   - Calculate the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - Append `egalites // 2` to the result list if the number of draws is non-negative; otherwise, append `-1`.
4. The program correctly handles all given test cases according to the problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
