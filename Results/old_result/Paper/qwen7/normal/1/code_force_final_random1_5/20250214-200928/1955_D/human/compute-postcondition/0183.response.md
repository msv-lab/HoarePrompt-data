Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1 (since `curr -= 1`), `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the condition `curr >= k` is met, and `b_values` remains unchanged; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
