Output State: The value of `n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by `(n-1)*2`, `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by `(n-2)*2`, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing all integers from the input decreased by `(n-1)*2` and `(n-2)*2` in the order they were added, and `u2vs[u]` is a list containing all integers from the input decreased by `(n-1)*2` and `(n-2)*2` in the order they were added.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `u2vs` will represent an undirected graph where each edge between nodes `u` and `v` is bidirectional, and the lists within `u2vs` will contain all neighbors of each node in the order they were connected.
