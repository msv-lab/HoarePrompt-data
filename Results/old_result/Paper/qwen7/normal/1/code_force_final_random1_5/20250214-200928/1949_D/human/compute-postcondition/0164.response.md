Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`; `nx` is 'S'**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was not mentioned to have any initial value, it is assumed to be an empty string before this operation. After appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S'. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `xx`, `i`, and `sa`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
