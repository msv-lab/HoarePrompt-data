Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `rev[rev[z].pop()].pop()`, `x` is 0, `one` is False, `two` is True**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `tmp` by first accessing `rev[z]` and popping an element from it, then using that popped element as an index to access another list (`rev[tmp]`) and pop an element from it. The other variables remain unchanged.
