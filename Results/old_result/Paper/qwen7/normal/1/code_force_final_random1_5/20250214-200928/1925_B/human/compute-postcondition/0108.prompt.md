Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 1, `q` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is an input integer, and `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value (1) and `ans`, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `x % i == 0`. The current value of `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `(x - n * i) % i` is equal to 0. If the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is true, `i` is further updated to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and either `x // i` or `i` if the conditions `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` or `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` are met. If neither condition is met, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
