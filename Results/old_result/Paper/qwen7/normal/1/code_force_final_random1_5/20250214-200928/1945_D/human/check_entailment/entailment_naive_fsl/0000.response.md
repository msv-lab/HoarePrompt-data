Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where Kirill needs to move through multiple positions to reach his desired spot, and it incorrectly accumulates costs.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Cost Accumulation Logic**: The program attempts to accumulate costs in a way that doesn't properly account for the conditions described. It tries to minimize the cost by choosing the cheaper option between `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, but it does not ensure that the best path is chosen for reaching the desired position.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The program uses a backward iteration approach to calculate the minimum cost, but it does not correctly propagate the minimum cost from each position to the next. This leads to incorrect results because it does not consider the cumulative effect of moving through multiple positions.

3. **Example Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     4 2
     7 3 6 9
     4 3 8 5
     ```
   - According to the problem description, Kirill needs to be in one of the first 2 positions. The optimal strategy would be to move Kirill to position 1 directly, which would cost `7` coins (since `a_1 = 7` and `b_1 = 4`).

   - However, the program calculates the cost as `14` coins, which is incorrect. The program fails to recognize that moving directly to position 1 is the optimal choice.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description, and thus, the correctness is **False**.
