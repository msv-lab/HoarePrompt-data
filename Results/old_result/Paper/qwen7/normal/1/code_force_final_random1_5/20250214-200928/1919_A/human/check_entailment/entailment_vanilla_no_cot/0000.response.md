Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the rules of the game:
- If the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he is the last one to make a move.
- If the sum is odd, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.

The provided examples and the logic in `func_1` align perfectly with the game's rules. Therefore, the program is correct.
