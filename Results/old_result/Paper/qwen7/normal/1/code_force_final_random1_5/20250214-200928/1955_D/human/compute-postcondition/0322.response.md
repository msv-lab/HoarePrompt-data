Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in b_values:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `cnt_b[0]` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range of `b_values`. Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `cnt_b[0]` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `cnt_b[0]` within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `cnt_b[0]` is 0**
