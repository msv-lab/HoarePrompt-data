Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, and `custo` is `a_values[max_p - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` increments `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`. Given that `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is updated to be its current value plus `a_values[max_p - 1]`. The other variables (`a_values` and `b_values`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
