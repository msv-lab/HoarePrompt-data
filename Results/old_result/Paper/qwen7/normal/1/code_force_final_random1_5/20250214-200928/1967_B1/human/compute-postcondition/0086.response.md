Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value. Given that `count` is 2 and `g` is `n // 2 - 1`, the updated value of `ans` becomes `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
