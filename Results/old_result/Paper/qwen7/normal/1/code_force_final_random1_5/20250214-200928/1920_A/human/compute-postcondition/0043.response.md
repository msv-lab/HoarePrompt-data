Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `t` is an input integer (not affected by the loop)
   - `v` is an input integer (not affected by the loop)
   - `start` is equal to `v` (not affected by the loop)
   - `end` is equal to `v` (not affected by the loop)
   - `num` is a list containing `[v]` (not affected by the loop)

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

Given that `n` is already within the range of 2 to 100, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1, making it 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is already valid (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 (unchanged)
   - `t` is an input integer (unchanged)
   - `v` is an input integer (unchanged)
   - `start` is equal to `v` (unchanged)
   - `end` is equal to `v` (unchanged)
   - `num` is a list containing `[v]` (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`, and `num` is a list containing `[v]`**.
