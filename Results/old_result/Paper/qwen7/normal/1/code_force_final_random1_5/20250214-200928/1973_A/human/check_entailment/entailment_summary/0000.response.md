Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the input format and the constraints specified in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` iterates over each test case and calculates the necessary values to determine the maximum number of draws.
3. The logic to check if the scores are consistent involves several steps:
   - Checking if the total points are even.
   - Ensuring the total number of matches does not exceed 3 (since each match awards 2 points).
   - Ensuring the highest score does not exceed the total number of matches.
   - Calculating the potential number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and checking if this value is non-negative before dividing by 2.
4. The program uses the provided test cases to validate the logic and prints the results correctly.

Given the execution summary and the provided examples, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
