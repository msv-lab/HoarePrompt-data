Output State: **`ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, previous_i + 1)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is defined as `previous_i + 1`, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c, previous_i + 1)`. The initial state of `ops` having an additional tuple `(c, i)` appended to it remains unchanged except for the new tuple added. The variables `ci` and `previous_i` retain their previous values.
