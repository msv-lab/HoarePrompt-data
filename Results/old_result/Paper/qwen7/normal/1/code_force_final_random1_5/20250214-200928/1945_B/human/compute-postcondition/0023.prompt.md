Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    mn = min(a, b) + m
    if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1:
        print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
    else:
        print(mn // a + mn // b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then no changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `(m % a != 0 or m % b != 0 or (a == 1) or (b == 1))` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`. The function does nothing in both the if and else parts, so the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
