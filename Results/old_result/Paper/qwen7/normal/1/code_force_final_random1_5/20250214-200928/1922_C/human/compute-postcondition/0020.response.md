Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, `d1[5]` is either 1 + `d1[4]` if `l[4] - l[3] < l[3] - l[2]` is true, or `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]` if the condition is false, `d1[5]` is updated to `l[5] - l[3] + d1[3]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `d1[i + 2]` to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Given `i` is 3, `d1[i + 2]` becomes `d1[5]`, and `l[i + 1]` is `l[4]`, `l[i]` is `l[3]`, and `d1[i + 1]` is `d1[4]`. Therefore, `d1[5]` is updated to `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
