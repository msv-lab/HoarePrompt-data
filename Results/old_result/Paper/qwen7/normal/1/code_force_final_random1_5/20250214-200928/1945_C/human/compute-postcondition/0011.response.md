Output State: **`t` must be at least 1 and at most 2â‹…10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing all characters from the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `sl = list(s)` converts the input string `s` into a list of its characters and assigns it to the variable `sl`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `pk`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
