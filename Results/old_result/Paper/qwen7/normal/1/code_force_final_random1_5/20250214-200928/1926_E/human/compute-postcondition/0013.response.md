Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing 0 and `m`, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

In this case, the code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. Since `n` is non-zero, `m` will be an integer calculated from `n`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged from their initial state.
