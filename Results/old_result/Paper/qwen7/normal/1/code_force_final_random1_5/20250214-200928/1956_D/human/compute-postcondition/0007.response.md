Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(l, r)` from the list `ops`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are tuples in `ops` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`.
   - `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`.
   - `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`.
   - `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over tuples in `ops`, the next tuple `(l, r)` in `ops` will be used.
   - After processing the current tuple `(l, r)`, the next tuple in `ops` becomes the new `(l, r)` for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `ops` should be updated to exclude the first tuple that was just processed.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` need to be updated to reflect the next tuple in `ops`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, but now `ops` contains all tuples except the first one.
- `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`.
- `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\), `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`, `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`, and `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`.**
