Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `j` is the length of the list `l`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, as each element is added to `i` during each iteration. The variable `j` will be equal to the length of the list `l`, as it is incremented once for each element in the list. The lists `p` and `c` will contain the cumulative sums of `l` and the count of 1s in `l`, respectively, as described in the loop body.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and the difference between `s` and `(b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is not greater than 1 or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no change occurs. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
