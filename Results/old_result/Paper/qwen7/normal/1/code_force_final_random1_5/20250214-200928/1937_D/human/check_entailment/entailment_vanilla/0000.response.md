Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to compute the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results.
   - `A` stores the cumulative time for pinballs starting from the left side.
   - `B` stores the cumulative time for pinballs starting from the right side.
   - The logic to fill these arrays seems complex and might not fully capture the movement and inversion rules.

3. **Complexity and Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` involves iterating through the string `s` twice (once from left to right and once from right to left).
   - It calculates the time taken for pinballs to leave the grid using the cumulative times stored in `A` and `B`.
   - However, the calculations seem overly complicated and do not directly follow the simple rules of movement and inversion.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` again to compute the final time for each cell.
   - The logic here also appears to be convoluted and does not straightforwardly apply the movement rules.

### Detailed Issues:

- **Incorrect Handling of Movement and Inversion:**
  - The program attempts to handle the movement and inversion rules but does so in a manner that is overly complex and may not correctly reflect the intended behavior.
  - For example, the calculation of `x` and `y` values in the middle of the function does not clearly follow the rules of movement and inversion.

- **Potential Off-by-One Errors:**
  - The indices and boundary conditions in the loops and calculations might lead to off-by-one errors, affecting the correctness of the results.

- **Lack of Clear Explanation:**
  - The code lacks clear comments explaining the logic, making it difficult to verify correctness without a deep understanding of the intended algorithm.

### Conclusion:

Given the complexity and potential issues with the logic, especially in handling the movement and inversion rules, the program does not appear to be correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: **False**
