Output State: **`final` is sorted, if `final` has a length of 0, it remains unchanged, if `final` has a length of 1, it contains either 0 or the value of `n`, `c1` is less than 50, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. The values of `final`, `c1`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
