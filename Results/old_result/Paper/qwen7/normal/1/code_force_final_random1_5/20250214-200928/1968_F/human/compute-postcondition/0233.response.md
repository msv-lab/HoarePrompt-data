Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has appended 'YES'; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence in `v1` that is not less than `l`; `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` that is just smaller than `r`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` using `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. This means `it2` is the index of the largest element in `v2` that is less than `r`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
