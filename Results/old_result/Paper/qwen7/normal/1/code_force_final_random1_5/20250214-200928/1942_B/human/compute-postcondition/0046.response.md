Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be -len(ar), `mex` will be the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)`, and `res` will be a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from the last index of `ar` to the first index, updating `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` and adjusting `mex` if necessary. After all iterations, `i` will be `-len(ar)` (since it starts at `len(ar) - 1` and decrements by 1 each iteration). The value of `mex` will be the minimum value it takes on during any iteration of the loop, ensuring that each element in `res` is correctly set to `mex - ar[i]`.
