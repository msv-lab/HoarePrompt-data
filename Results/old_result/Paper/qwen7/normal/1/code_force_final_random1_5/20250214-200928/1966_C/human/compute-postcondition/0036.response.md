Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order followed by 0.**

Explanation: The code first takes an input of integers separated by spaces, converts them to a list of integers, removes duplicates using `set()`, sorts the list in descending order using `sorted()` with `reverse=True`, and then appends 0 to the list. The initial value of `tc` and `n` remains unchanged. The resulting list `arr` is in descending order and ends with 0.
