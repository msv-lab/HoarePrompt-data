Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `nums`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
