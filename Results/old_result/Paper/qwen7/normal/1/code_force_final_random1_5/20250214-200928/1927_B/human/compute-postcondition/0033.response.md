Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` remains the same, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `alp` is a list of characters from 'a' to 'z'**.

Explanation: The given code simply initializes the list `alp` with the English alphabet. None of the existing variables (`j`, `l`, `ans`, `array`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The list `alp` is updated with the specified values.
