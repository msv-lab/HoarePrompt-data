The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, which controls the number of iterations of the loop. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are as follows:
- `pk` remains unchanged.
- `mini` remains unchanged.
- `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order.
- If the current value of `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `final` contains an additional element `n` appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1. The other variables (`pk`, `mini`, `final`, `o`, `n`, and `c1`) remain unchanged according to the problem statement.

State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, if the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end, otherwise `final` contains an additional element `n` appended to it, `t` is `t - 1`**
