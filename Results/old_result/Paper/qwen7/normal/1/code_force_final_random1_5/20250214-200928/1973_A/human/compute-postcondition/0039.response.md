Postcondition: `p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` becomes a list containing `-1, -1`.
