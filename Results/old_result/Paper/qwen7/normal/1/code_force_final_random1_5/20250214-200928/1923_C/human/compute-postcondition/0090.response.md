Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- The difference between `b - a + 1` is greater than 1
- The value of `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'YES'` without any additional variables or values being substituted into it.

Output: **YES**
