Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, which is an input integer; `array` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is `i + 1`; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.**

The code initializes `ans` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
