Output State: `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 3, `not_c` is False.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(set_) - 1`. Given that `set_` is initially `[1]`, the length of `set_` is 1. Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i = 0`, which means it won't actually run at all because the range starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) 1. However, based on the provided information, we can infer that the loop has been executed 3 times. Since the loop breaks when `not_c` becomes False and `A` toggles with each iteration, after 3 iterations, `A` would be True (since it started as False and toggled 3 times), `i` would be 2 (as the loop increments `i` but stops before reaching the next index), and `not_c` remains False. The array `arr` and set `set_` do not change during the loop, so they remain as initially stated.
