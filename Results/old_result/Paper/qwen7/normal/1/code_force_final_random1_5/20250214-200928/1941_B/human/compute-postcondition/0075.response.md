Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` decreases the value of `a[i + 1]` by `2 * opNum`. The values of `stop`, `i`, and `opNum` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated to `n - 2 - 1` which simplifies to `n - 3`.
