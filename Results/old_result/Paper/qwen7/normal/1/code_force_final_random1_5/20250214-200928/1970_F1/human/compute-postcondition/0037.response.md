Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `ind`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range of `len(line)`, meaning `ind` will take values from 0 to `len(line) - 1`.

3. **Determine the postconditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is 1 or 2.
   - `len(line)` remains the same.
   - `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`.
   - `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`.
   - If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` now contains `(i, ind)`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `ind` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `ind` was 1 or 2, it will now be either 2 or 3 (if `ind` was 2, it will become 3; if `ind` was 1, it will become 2).
   - `len(line)` remains unchanged.
   - `line[ind]` should still not be `'..'`.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind])` should still return `False`.
   - `allPlayers[line[ind]]` should still be `False`.
   - If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` will contain `(i, ind)`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- If `ind` was 1, it will now be 2.
- If `ind` was 2, it will now be 3.
- `len(line)` remains the same.
- `line[ind]` should still not be `'..'`.
- `isPlayer(line[ind])` should still return `False`.
- `allPlayers[line[ind]]` should still be `False`.
- If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` will contain `(i, ind)`.

Since `ind` can only be 1 or 2, and it will now be 2 or 3, we need to consider both cases:

- If `ind` was 1, it will now be 2.
- If `ind` was 2, it will now be 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`ind` is 2 or 3, `len(line)` remains the same, `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` now contains `(i, ind)`.

This ensures that the loop can continue executing based on the updated value of `ind`.
