Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. 

For example, consider the encoded value `3`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"aaa"`. However, the program generates `"aaaz"` instead, which is not lexicographically smallest. This happens because the program logic incorrectly constructs the word when `n` is less than or equal to 26.

Here is a breakdown of the issue:
- When `n <= 26`, the program constructs the word as `"aa" + alphabet[n - 3]`.
- For `n = 3`, the correct word should be `"aaa"`, but the program outputs `"aaaz"`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that when `n <= 26`, it constructs the word as `"aaa"`.
