Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is `k`. If `i` is in list `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in list `a`, `aOnes` does not exceed `newk` or `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`. If `i` is neither in list `a` nor list `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
