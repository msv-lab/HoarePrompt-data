Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list containing the intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop from the last to the first, where each value of `p` is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point modulo `m`.**

Here, `b` is derived from `a` and `s` such that for each index `i` in the range of `n`, if `s[i]` is 'L', then `b[i] = a[i] * b[i+1] % m` (if `i < n-1`) or `b[i] = a[i]` (if `i == n-1`), and if `s[i]` is 'R', then `b[i] = a[i] * b[i-1] % m` (if `i > 0`) or `b[i] = a[i]` (if `i == 0`). The function computes these values in reverse order starting from the last element of `s` to the first.
