Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is updated to `b + c`, `a` is the first part of the split string of `s`, `c` is the third part of the split string of `s`, `s` is the next line in the input, and the string `s` is split into three parts: `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `b` is now `b + c`.**

This means that the string `s` has been split into three integers `a`, `b + c`, and `c` using the `split()` function, and these values have been assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The original values of `t` and `b` (before the operation) are preserved, and `b` is now updated to `b + c`. The string `s` remains unchanged except for its interpretation as a sequence of space-separated integers.
