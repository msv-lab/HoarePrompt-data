Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `i` is -1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, and `curr` is now equal to `curr + 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state. Specifically, `i` remains -1, `n` and `m` remain known, `len(b)` remains known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either reduced by 1 or stays the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` with its count in `cnt_b` decreased by 1 or not in `b_values` with no change, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is already greater than or equal to `k`.
