N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string contains M characters. Each character can be one of the following: '.', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', or '.Q'. P is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10. T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. The actions are represented as a list of strings, where each string describes an action performed by an entity on the field.
