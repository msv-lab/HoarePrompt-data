Output State: **`zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged, `c1` remains unchanged, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `sl` remains unchanged, `o` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] == '0'`, and `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] != '0'`, and `lst` remains as it was before the if statement.**

This means that `zero_perc` is now calculated using the formula `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. The value of `t` has been decreased by 1. The increments of `zero` and `one` depend on whether `s[i]` is '0' or not. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
