Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`
   - `idx` is increased by 1
   - `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `i`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `k < n`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `idx` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so it will be `k + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `pf[k + 1]` will be calculated as `pf[k] ^ a[k + 1]`.
   - `mp[pf[k + 1]]` will be updated to include the index `k + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a[i]` will be `int(data[idx])` where `i = k + 1` and `idx = k + 1`.
   - `idx` will be `k + 1`.
   - `pf[i]` will be `pf[k] ^ a[k + 1]`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` will be a list containing the index `i = k + 1`.

Given that `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue, and considering the previous state where `i` was `k` and `idx` was `k + 1`, the next state should be:

**State: `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `i`, where `i` is `k + 1` and `idx` is `k + 1`.**

To generalize this, we can say:

**State: `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `i`, where `i` is `k + 1` and `idx` is `k + 1`.**

Since `i` starts from 1 and `idx` starts from 1, the next state would be:

**State: `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `i`, where `i` is `2` and `idx` is `2`.**

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration is:

**State: `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `i`, where `i` is `2` and `idx` is `2`.**
