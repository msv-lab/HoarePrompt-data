Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < m`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Body**: The loop body updates `i` and `cnt_b` based on certain conditions involving `a[i]` and `b_values`.

4. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - m + len(b) + 2`.
   - If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration (unless it hits the condition where `a[i]` is not in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[i]]` is negative), the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
- `m` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`i` is `n - m + len(b) + 3`, `m` is the same as before**.
