Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is one less than the first element of the list `s`, `j` is -1, `ans` is 0, `z` is 1, `h` is equal to the first element of the list `s`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is increased by 1, `i` is the second element of the list `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is increased by either 1 or 2. If `h` is less than `i`, then `j` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next value in the sequence `s` after the previous value of `i`; variable `j` is increased by 1. If `h < i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
