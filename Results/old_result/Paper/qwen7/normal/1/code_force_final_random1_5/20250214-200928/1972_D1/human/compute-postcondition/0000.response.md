Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the function call `func_10()`. The function `func_10()` returns an integer value that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means there are up to \(10^4\) test cases.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop will run for as many times as the result of `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the return value of `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Additionally, since `t` represents the number of test cases, it should be set to a value within its valid range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`. It must be a positive integer, and `t` should be set to a value within its valid range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and func_10() returns a positive integer**
