You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18, and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7 for all 1 <= i <= n. ops is a list used to store the operations performed.
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `r + 1`, `l` is the same as the original value, `r` is the same as the original value, and every element in the list `a` from index `l` to index `r` is set to `r - l + 1`.
        #
        #In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` has reached `r + 1`. All elements in the sublist of `a` from index `l` to `r` have been updated to the value `r - l + 1`. The variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial values.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: Postcondition: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and either `pos` is decremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`, or `pos` is still equal to `l`.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: Postcondition: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is decremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further changes are made to `pos`.
    #State: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive. If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then all elements in the sublist of `a` from index `l` to `r` are set to `r - l + 1`, and `i` is set to `r + 1`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is decremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further changes are made to `pos`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, l and r, where l is a list of non-negative integers of length n (1 <= n <= 18) and each element in the list is between 0 and 10^7 inclusive. The function returns the maximum possible sum after performing a series of operations specified in the ops list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
