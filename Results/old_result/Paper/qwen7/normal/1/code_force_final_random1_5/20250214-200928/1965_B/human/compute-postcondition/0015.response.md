Output State: **`i` is 4, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is [4, 8, 16]**.

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 4, `2 ** i` equals 16. Therefore, `ans` changes from `[4, 8]` to `[4, 8, 16]`. The values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged.
