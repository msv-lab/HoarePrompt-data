Output: **NO**

Explanation: The initial state provides the following information:
- `stop` is `True`.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `opNum` is `a[i] - opNum`.
- `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`.
- `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output will be the string `'NO'`.
