Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is equal to `j`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus one, `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `ans1` is 0, and `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `p` is equal to `j`, which is the length of the list `s` minus one, `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, and `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i > h` is true or false. If `i > h` is true, `z` is set to 0 and the loop or if statement is broken. If `i > h` is false, `z` remains 1, and `ans1` is 1 if `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `p` is equal to `j`, which is the length of the list `s` minus one; `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`; `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i > h` is true or false; if `i == h`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `s[0] != h`; otherwise, if `i > h`, we break out of the loop; otherwise, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, and if `z` is 1, then `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `p` is equal to `j`, which is the length of the list `s` minus one; `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`; `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i_next > h` is true or false; if `i_next == h`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `s[0] != h`; if `i_next > h`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `i_next` is the next element in the list `s`, and if `z` is 1, then `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
