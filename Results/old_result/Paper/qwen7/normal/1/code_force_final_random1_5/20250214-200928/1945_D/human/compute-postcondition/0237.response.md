Output State: **`custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2] + a_values[0]`, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[0]` adds the value of `a_values[0]` to `custo`. However, since `a_values` is an empty list, `a_values[0]` does not exist and will raise an IndexError if accessed directly. But for the purpose of updating the state, we consider the addition operation. Similarly, `b_values` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `custo` is updated to be the sum of its original value and `a_values[0]`, which in this case is effectively just adding `a_values[0]` to `custo`.
