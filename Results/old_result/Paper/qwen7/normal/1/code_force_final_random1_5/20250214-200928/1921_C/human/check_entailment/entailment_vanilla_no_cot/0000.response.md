Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Energy Consumption**: The program calculates the energy consumption for turning the phone off and on but does not correctly account for the charge loss between messages. Specifically, the logic to determine whether turning the phone off and on is beneficial is flawed.

2. **Logic Flaw in Determining If Messages Can Be Sent**: The program checks if the total energy consumed (sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b`) is less than the initial charge `f`. However, this does not accurately reflect the charge levels at the times when messages need to be sent.

3. **Missing Handling of Charge Levels**: The program does not properly handle the charge levels at the exact moments when messages need to be sent. It should ensure that the phone has enough charge to send each message without dropping below zero charge.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program outputs 'Yes' and 'No' with lowercase letters, which might not be acceptable according to the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to simulate the process of sending messages while keeping track of the phone's charge level and determining the optimal strategy for turning the phone off and on to minimize energy consumption.
