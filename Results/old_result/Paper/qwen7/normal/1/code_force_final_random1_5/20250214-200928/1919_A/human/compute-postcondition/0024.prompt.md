You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the value of `winner`, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The `results` list will contain `t` (which is now 0) elements, but since `t` is 0, the list will be empty. However, each element in the `results` list is the `winner` from the last iteration of the loop, as the `results` list is updated with the `winner` in each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. It returns different outputs based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
