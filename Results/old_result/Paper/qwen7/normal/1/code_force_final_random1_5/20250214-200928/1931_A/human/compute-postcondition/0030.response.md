Output State: **`word` is 'zzzzzz', `i` is 4**

Explanation: The variable `word` is initially an empty string (`''`). The code appends `'zz'` to `word` using the value of `n - 53`. Since `n` is an input integer, let's consider the general case where `n` is any integer. The value of `alphabet[n - 53]` would be the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string. However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact character. But the code appends `'zz'` to `word` regardless of the character from `alphabet`. Given that `n` is an integer, `n - 53` will also be an integer, and appending `'zz'` to an empty string results in `'zz'`. Since this operation is performed once, `word` becomes `'zzzzzz'`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 4.
