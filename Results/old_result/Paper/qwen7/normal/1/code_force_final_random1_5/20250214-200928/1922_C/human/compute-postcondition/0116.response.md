Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the integer `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The problem statement mentions that `i` will be 0, but this is not directly relevant to the loop `for j in range(m)`. The variable `j` will start from 0 by default when using `range(m)`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute properly. This means `m` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
