Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `j` is 1, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is equal to `n`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, `sm` is updated to \(2^k \times sm - sm\); `sm` is increased by `suf[n]`, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\) taking the floor value, `sm` is updated by adding \((a + 1) \times (10^9 + 7)\)**.

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- The value of `j` remains 1.
- The value of `b` remains the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
- The value of `k` remains the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- The value of `l` remains the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.
- The value of `suf` remains the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself.
- The value of `n` remains equal to `t`.
- The value of `i` remains equal to `n`.
- The value of `smin` remains a list starting with 0 and containing up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration.
- The value of `sm` remains the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
- `sm` is updated to \(2^k \times sm - sm\).
- `sm` is increased by `suf[n]`.
- `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\) taking the floor value.
- `sm` is updated by adding \((a + 1) \times (10^9 + 7)\).
