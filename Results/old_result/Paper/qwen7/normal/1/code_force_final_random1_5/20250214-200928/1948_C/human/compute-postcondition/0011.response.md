Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is an input string
   - `b` is a new input string
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `n` with a step of 2. This means `i` will take odd values (1, 3, 5, ...).

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that it contains a condition to break out of the loop if certain conditions are met.

4. **Conditions for Breaking Out of the Loop:**
   - If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 1]` is less than '<', or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is less than '<'.

5. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Since `i` is 1, the condition `i + 1 < n` is true because `i + 1 = 2` and `n > 1`.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 2, making it 3.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute again, meaning `i + 1 < n` must still hold true, and the conditions inside the loop body must not be met to avoid breaking out of the loop prematurely.

7. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be 3 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The values of `a` and `b` do not change within the loop, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1**
