Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `v = na_frente` to `v = -1` in reverse order.

3. **Determine the state changes within the loop**: The postcondition tells us that if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated based on the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated based on the same conditions but without the comparison.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `v` starts from `na_frente` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `na_frente` was decremented by 1 (i.e., `na_frente - 1`), and `pos_final` was also decremented by 1 (i.e., `pos_final - 1`).

5. **Next iteration state**:
   - `v` will be `na_frente - 1` because it started from `na_frente` and has already decreased once.
   - `na_frente` will be `na_frente - 1` (decremented by 1).
   - `pos_final` will be `pos_final - 1` (decremented by 1).

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `total` remains unchanged as it is updated inside the loop based on the values of `v`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these adjustments:

**State: **`total` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `v` is `na_frente - 1`**
