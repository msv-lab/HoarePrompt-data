Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `x` will be 0, `a` and `b` will no longer be defined within the loop context, `rev[b]` will contain a list of all integers `a` such that there is an edge from `a` to `b` in the graph, and `lst[a]` will contain a list of all integers `b` such that there is an edge from `a` to `b` in the graph.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `z`. This changes the value of `z` to the input integer. The other variables (`x`, `a`, `b`, `rev`, and `lst`) remain unchanged from their previous states as described in the initial state.
