Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts with `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is set to `feat[0]`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be set to 1.
   - `n` should be set to `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Other variables and lists**:
   - `feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` should be `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0**
