Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and either (`a - b` equals `-a` with `a` being the value after the operation, or `b - a` equals `-b` with `b` being the value after the operation).**
