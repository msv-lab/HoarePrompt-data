Postcondition: `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` (if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`) or `b_values[y]` (if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`), and `y` is within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` with `y` decreased by 1 in both cases.
