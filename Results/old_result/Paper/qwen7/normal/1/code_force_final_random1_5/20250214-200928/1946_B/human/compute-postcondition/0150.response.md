Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `smin` has its element at index `i` appended to itself.**

The code `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the value at index `i` of `smin` to itself. Given that `i` is 1, the first element of `smin` (at index 1) is appended to `smin`. However, since the exact value of `smin` is not specified, we can only state that the element at index `i` (which is 1) is appended to `smin`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `n` is still greater than 0.
