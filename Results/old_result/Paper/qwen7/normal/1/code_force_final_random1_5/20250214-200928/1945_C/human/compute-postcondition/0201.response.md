Output State: **`zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 3)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 2)`, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged, `c1` remains unchanged, `t` is `t-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `sl` remains unchanged, `o` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `zero` is incremented by 1, `one` remains unchanged, and `lst` remains as it was before the if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1. As a result, the calculation for `zero_perc` changes from `zero * 100 // (i + 2)` to `zero * 100 // (i + 3)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
