Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, and `results` now contains 'YES'.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `'YES'` is appended to the `results` list.
