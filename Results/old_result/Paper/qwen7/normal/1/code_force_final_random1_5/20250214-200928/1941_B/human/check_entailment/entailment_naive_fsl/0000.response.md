Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program checks only the first and last elements of the array for specific conditions and prints 'NO' if these conditions are met. However, the problem allows for multiple operations to be performed, and the conditions checked are too restrictive.

Consider the following test case:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```

The program will check if `b[0] % 2 == 1` and `b[1] != b[0] + 2`, or if `b[-1] % 2 == 1` and `b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`. In this case, `b[0] = 2` (even), `b[1] = 4` (even), `b[-1] = 1` (odd), and `b[-2] = 5` (odd). Since none of the conditions are met, the program outputs 'NO'. However, we can see that the array can be made all zeros through the following operations:
1. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[2, 4, 3, 3, 1]`.
2. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]`.
3. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[2, 2, 0, 0, 1]`.
4. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.
5. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' for this valid case, indicating that it does not correctly implement the solution for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
