Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `for i in range(n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, it cannot be less than `n` unless `n` is increased.
   - `n` must be at least 1, but since `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to potentially execute again (because if `n` were 1, `i` would be 2, which is not less than 1).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become `n + 2`.
   - `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` must be at least 2

The final state is:
State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be at least 2**
