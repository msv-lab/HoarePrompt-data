Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `results` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.

This means that the function `func_1(a, b)` has been called with the inputs `a` and `b`, and the result of this function call is stored in the variable `winner`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
