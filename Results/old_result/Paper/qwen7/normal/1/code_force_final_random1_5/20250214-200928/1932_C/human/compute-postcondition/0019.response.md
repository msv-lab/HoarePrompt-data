Postcondition: **`l` is either 1 or 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing either the element `a[l]` or the element `a[l]` appended, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `i` is 1, and `s[i]` is either 'L' or not 'L'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `l` is set to 2; otherwise, `b` is modified to contain the element `a[r]` appended to it, and `r` is adjusted to either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `i` is set to 2, and `s[i]` is either 'L' or not 'L'.**
