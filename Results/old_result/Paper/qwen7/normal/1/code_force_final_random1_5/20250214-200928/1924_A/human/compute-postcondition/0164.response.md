Output State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is `cur + 1 << cur_ss`, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `ans` is equal to `ss` if `cur` does not equal `1 << cur_ss` and `2 * (ord(ss) - ord('a'))` otherwise.**

Explanation:
- The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Here, `1 << cur_ss` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `cur_ss` positions, which effectively multiplies 1 by \(2^{cur_ss}\).
- The other variables (`cnt`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
