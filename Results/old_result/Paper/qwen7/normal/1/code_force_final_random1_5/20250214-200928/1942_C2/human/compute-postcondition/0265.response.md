Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is 2, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n` and both `t1` and `t2` are in set `st`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` from `(a[3] + 2) % n` to `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Since `i` is 3, `t2` becomes `(a[3] + 2) % n`, which is the same as the previous value of `t2`. Therefore, the values of `t1` and `t2` remain in the set `st`. All other variables (`i`, `ans`) retain their original values.
