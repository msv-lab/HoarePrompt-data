Output State: **tc is equal to the total number of test cases (t), n and m are integers representing dimensions of the grid, gr is a list of strings representing the grid, ans is 'NO', impossible is True, and both j and i are set to their maximum possible values within the loop (j is m - 2 and i is n - 1).**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `tc` will be equal to the total number of test cases (`t`).
- The variables `n` and `m` will retain their last assigned values from the last iteration of the loop.
- The list `gr` will contain the grid as it was input for the last test case.
- The variable `ans` will be set to 'NO', indicating that the conditions checked within the loop did not allow `ans` to remain 'YES'.
- The variable `impossible` will be `True`, signifying that the conditions for `ans` to be 'YES' were not met.
- The variable `j` will be `m - 2`, and `i` will be `n - 1`, which are the maximum values they can take within the loops.
