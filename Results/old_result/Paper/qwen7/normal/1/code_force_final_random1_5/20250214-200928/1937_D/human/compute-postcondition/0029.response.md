Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 4, 2, 7]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 2, 3], and i is 3`.**

The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 3, to the list `idx_A`. The initial value of `idx_A` was `[0, 2, 2]`, so after appending 3, the updated list is `[0, 2, 2, 3]`. The other variables (`s`, `A`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
