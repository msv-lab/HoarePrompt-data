Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `m`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < m`.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - If `y` is greater than `x`, no changes are made to `m`, `x`, and `y`.
   - If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, no changes are made to `m` and `x`, but `y` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `j < m`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `j`).
   - Therefore, `m` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged from the previous iteration because the loop body does not modify them unless `y` is less than or equal to `x`, which is already considered in the postcondition.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `m`, `x`, and `y`.

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**
