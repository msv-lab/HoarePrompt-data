Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in num`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `num`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is an element in `num`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `i`: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first element in `num`.
   - `num`: `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3.

4. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be an element in `num`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is the first element in `num` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be an element in `num`.
   - `num` remains the same as it is a list of elements that satisfy the condition `t` is 3.

6. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `count_num`: Its value depends on the conditions inside the loop body, but it does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`: These values are derived from the loop body and do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `num`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is now the second element in `num` (since it was the first element in the previous iteration).
- `num` remains the same.

State: **`count_num` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the second element in `num`, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3.**
