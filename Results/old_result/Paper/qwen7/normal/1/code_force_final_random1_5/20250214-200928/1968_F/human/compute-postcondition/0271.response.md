Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now `n + 1`; the variable `idx` is `4 * (n + 2) + n`; the list `results` now contains one additional empty string at the end; the prefix function `pf` remains unchanged with `pf[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n + 1` storing the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of the list `a`; the dictionary `mp` remains unchanged with each unique value in `pf` mapped to their respective indices.**

In this step, the code appends an empty string to the `results` list. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
