### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Character Set Check**: For each test case, the program checks if the set of unique characters (`a`) in the string `s` has a length of exactly 2. If so, it prints "NO", indicating that no rearrangement of `s` can produce a different string. This logic is correct because if there are only two unique characters, any rearrangement will result in the same string.

3. **Rearrangement Logic**:
   - If the set of unique characters does not have a length of 2, the program prints "YES".
   - It then sorts the string `s` both in ascending and descending order.
   - If the sorted string in ascending order (`b`) is the same as the original string `s`, it prints the sorted string in descending order (`c`).
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string in ascending order (`b`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string consists of more than two unique characters, the program will correctly find a different rearrangement.
   - If the string consists of exactly two unique characters, the program correctly identifies that no different rearrangement is possible and prints "NO".

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs "YES" followed by a valid rearrangement or "NO" if no valid rearrangement exists. The format matches the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program logic is sound and handles all specified cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
