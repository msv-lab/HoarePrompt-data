Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '>', and the overall postcondition is as follows: if `l < r`, then `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, if `l >= r`, then `b` is either `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, or `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r <= 0`.
