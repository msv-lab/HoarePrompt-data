Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `r` is decremented by 1. The condition that `n` remains greater than 0 and `l` remains the same are unchanged. The variable `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. The variable `b` retains its original value as no operation was performed on it.
