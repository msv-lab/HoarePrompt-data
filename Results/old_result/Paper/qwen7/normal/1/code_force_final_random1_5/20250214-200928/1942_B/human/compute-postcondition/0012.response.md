Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means `i` starts from `len(ar) - 1` and decreases until it reaches `0`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i - 1`.

4. **Check the Loop Continuation Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect its new value for the next iteration.

Given the postcondition and the loop head, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment**:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `i - 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `0`**.
