Output State: **i is 400001, j is "0", pd[i] is 400000.**

Natural Language Description: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be 400001, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to 400000. The variable `j` will be "0" because `i` is a large number (400001) and when we convert it to a string, the last digit will be "1". However, since the loop processes each digit of `i`, `j` will eventually become "0" after processing all the digits except the last one. The variable `pd[i]` will be 400000 because it starts at 0 and gets incremented by the sum of all digits of every `i` from 1 to 400000. Each `i` contributes its digits to `pd[i]`, and since there are 400000 iterations, the final value of `pd[i]` will be the sum of all these contributions, which results in 400000.
