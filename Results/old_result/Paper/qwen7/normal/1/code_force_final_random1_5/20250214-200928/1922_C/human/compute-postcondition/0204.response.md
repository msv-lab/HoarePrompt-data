Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `m-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. The values of `j`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition `y > x` is true or false.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `m-1`. The values of `m`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged from their initial values, as the loop body does not modify these variables. The condition `y > x` within the loop does not affect the final value of `j`, which increments with each iteration of the loop.
