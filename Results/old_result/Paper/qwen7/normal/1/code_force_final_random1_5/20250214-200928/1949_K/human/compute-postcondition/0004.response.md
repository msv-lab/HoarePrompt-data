Output State: **`num` is removed from the `numbers` list and added to one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`), `numbers` is now a list of `n-1` positive integers sorted in descending order, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n-1`, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are updated with one additional element, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated by adding `num` to the respective group's sum.**

This output state reflects that the function `distribute_number(num)` has taken the largest element from the `numbers` list and added it to one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`). The `numbers` list is now one element shorter, and the groups and sums are updated accordingly.
