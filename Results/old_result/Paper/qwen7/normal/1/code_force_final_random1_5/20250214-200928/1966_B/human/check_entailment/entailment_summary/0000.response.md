Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and stores the grid in a list `gr`.
3. It initializes the answer `ans` to 'YES', assuming it's possible to make all squares the same color.
4. The program then checks if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is the same as the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`). If they are different, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
5. If they are the same, it further checks if the first row or the last column can be uniform without changing the top-left and bottom-right cells. This is done by checking if all elements in the first row or the last column are the same as the corresponding elements in the top-left and bottom-right cells.
6. If the first row or the last column cannot be uniform without changing the top-left and bottom-right cells, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
7. Finally, it prints the answer for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the program appears to follow the problem statement correctly. It checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color.

Correctness: **True**
