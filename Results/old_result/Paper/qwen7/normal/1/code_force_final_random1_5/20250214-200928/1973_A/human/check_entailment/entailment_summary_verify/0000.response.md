### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the given scores.
   - It checks several conditions to ensure the scores are consistent with a valid set of games and results.
   - The main logic involves calculating `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites` to determine the number of draws.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over a predefined list of test cases (`cas_de_test`) rather than reading from standard input. This is a deviation from the problem statement which specifies handling multiple test cases.
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of draws is mostly correct, but there are some issues:
     - The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is indeed too restrictive and can lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
     - The calculation of `egalites` and its division by 2 to get the number of draws is generally correct, but the overall logic needs to be more robust.

3. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - **Case (0, 0, 0)**: Correctly outputs `0`.
   - **Case (0, 1, 1)**: Correctly outputs `1`.
   - **Case (0, 2, 3)**: Incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `-1`. This is due to the restrictive condition mentioned above.
   - **Case (3, 3, 3)**: Incorrectly outputs `-1` instead of `3`. The logic does not account for the possibility of 3 draws in this scenario.
   - **Case (3, 4, 5)**: Incorrectly outputs `6` instead of `-1`. The logic does not handle this case correctly.
   - **Case (1, 1, 10)**: Incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `-1`. The logic does not properly check if the scores are consistent with any valid set of games and results.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where the scores are `1 1 10` correctly.
   - The logic in the program is overly restrictive and does not account for all valid scenarios, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program has logical errors that prevent it from correctly handling all test cases, particularly those where the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results.

**Final: False**
