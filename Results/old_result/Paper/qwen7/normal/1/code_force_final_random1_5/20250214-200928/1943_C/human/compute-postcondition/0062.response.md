Output State: **`c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, and `ops` is an empty list.**

The code calculates the value of `c2` as half the length of `path_ba`. Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer representing half of the length of `path_ba`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
