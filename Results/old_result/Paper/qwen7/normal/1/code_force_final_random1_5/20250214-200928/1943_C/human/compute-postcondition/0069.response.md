The code snippet appends a tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 4, the tuple added to `ops` is `(c2, 4)`. The value of `c2` remains unchanged as the operation only modifies the `ops` list. All other variables (`d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `i`) remain in their original states.

Output State: **`c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, `ops` is a list containing four tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4)), and `i` is 4.**
