Postcondition: ***`impossible` remains `False`, `ans` remains `'NO'`, `i` remains `n + n`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2, and if `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, the condition is satisfied.***

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]` is true or false, the variables `impossible`, `ans`, `i`, `gr`, `j`, and `m` retain their initial states as specified in the precondition.
