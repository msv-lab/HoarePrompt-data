Output State: **`j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[j]` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state and the code does not specify which index `i` refers to, we assume `i` is meant to be `j`. Therefore, the value of `a[j]` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
