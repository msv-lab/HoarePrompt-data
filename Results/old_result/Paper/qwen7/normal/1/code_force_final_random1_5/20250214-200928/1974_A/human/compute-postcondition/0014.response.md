Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2\), `m` is \(15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2) - y \cdot 4\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `z` to \((y + 1) // 2\). This means the expression for `z` is simplified to just \((y + 1) // 2\). The value of `m` is recalculated using the new value of `z`. Therefore, `m` is now \(15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2) - y \cdot 4\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
