Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x[1]` is an input integer, `y[1]` is an input integer, `r[1]` is an input integer, `x[2]` is an input integer, `y[2]` is an input integer, `r[2]` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Given that `i` is 2, these values are assigned to `x[2]`, `y[2]`, and `r[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
