Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `zero_perc` is either 0, 100, or 50, `one` is 2, and `one_perc` is -200 * (o - 2) // (n - 1). If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `i` is set to 2. In all cases, the values of `n`, `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged as specified in the precondition.
