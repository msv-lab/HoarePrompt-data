Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 1 (since `bOnes += 1` was executed), `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is present in both `a` and `b`.**

This means that the variable `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, making its new value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
