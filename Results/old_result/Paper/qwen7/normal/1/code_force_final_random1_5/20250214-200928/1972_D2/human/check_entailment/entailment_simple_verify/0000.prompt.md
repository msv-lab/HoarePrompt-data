You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and n, m are within the limits specified in the problem description.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is less than 15, `m` is less than 10, `y` is 4, `x` is 4, and `cnt` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the conditions in the loop head (`while x * x <= n`) and the inner loop head (`while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`) dictate that the loop will stop when `x * x > n` or either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Given the final state after 3 iterations, we know that `x` is 4, `n` is less than 15, and `m` is less than 10. Since `x` increments by 1 each iteration and starts at 1, the loop will stop when `x` reaches 4 because increasing `x` further would make `x * x > n`. The value of `y` remains 4 as it does not change within the loop once the outer loop's condition is met. The variable `cnt` remains unchanged because none of the conditions inside the loops would allow further increments of `x` or `y` that satisfy all the constraints.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt remains unchanged)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t is 0 and func_1() has been called exactly 3 times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one. The logic within `func_1` ensures that the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) are checked appropriately. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to handle all potential cases correctly without missing any edge cases.
