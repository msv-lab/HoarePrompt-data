### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Usage**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_10`, `func_11`, `func_12`, `func_13`, and `func_14` are defined and used in the program. However, only `func_14` is relevant to solving the problem as described.
   - `func_14` correctly generates a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements:
     - It ensures no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - It includes subsequences that sum to all integers from 1 to `n` except `k`.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

3. **Function `func_14` Analysis**:
   - If `k == 1`, `func_14` generates a sequence `[2, 3, 4, ..., 2^l]` where `l` is the bit length of `n`. This sequence ensures no subsequence sums to 1 and includes all sums from 2 to `n`.
   - If `k > 1`, `func_14` generates a sequence that includes `[2, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k+1, 2*k+1, (k-1-sum(ans))]` and continues with powers of 2. This ensures no subsequence sums to `k` and includes all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `func_14` correctly handles both cases and generates sequences that meet the problem's requirements.
   - The function `func_15` correctly processes the input and calls `func_14` for each test case, ensuring the output format is correct.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
