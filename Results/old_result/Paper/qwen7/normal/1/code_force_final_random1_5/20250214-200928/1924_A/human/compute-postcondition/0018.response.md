Postcondition: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ss`, and if `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` is equal to `cur`, then `cur` remains unchanged.**
