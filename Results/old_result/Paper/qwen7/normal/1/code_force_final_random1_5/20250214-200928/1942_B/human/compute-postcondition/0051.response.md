Output State: **`i` is -len(ar), `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all i in the range of `len(ar)`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is None, and `ar` is a list of integers inputted by the user.**

The code initializes the list `res` with `None` values, but does not change the values of `i`, `mex`, or `ar`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The only change is that `res` is now a list of length `n` filled with `None` values.
