Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `r` is now an integer from `data[idx + 1]`, and `results` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` simply assigns the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` to `v2`. This does not change the values of any other variables or the conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with only `v2` being updated to the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.
