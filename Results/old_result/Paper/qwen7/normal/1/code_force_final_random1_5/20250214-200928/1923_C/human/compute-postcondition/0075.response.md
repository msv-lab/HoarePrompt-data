Output State: **`x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` must contain the value 1, `i` is 2, `p` contains the value [3, 2], `c` is a list containing the value [2, 2]**.

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Since `j` is increased by 1 from its initial state (though its exact value is not specified), it gets appended to `c`. Given that `c` initially contains the value 2, after appending `j`, `c` will contain `[2, 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
