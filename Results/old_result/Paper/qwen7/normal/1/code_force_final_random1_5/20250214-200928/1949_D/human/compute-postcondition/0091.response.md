Output State: **`x` is an array, `j` is `j + 1`, `b[i]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. The initial state mentions that `x` is an array and `j` is `j + 1`, but these variables are not affected by the code. Therefore, `x` remains an array, `j` remains `j + 1`, and `b[i]` is increased by 1.
