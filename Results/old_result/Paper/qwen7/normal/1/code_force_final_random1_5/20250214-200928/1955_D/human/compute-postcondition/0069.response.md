Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 (since `i` is 0, this means `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented)
   - `curr` is decreased by 1
   - `ans` is initialized (let's assume it is 0 for simplicity)
   - If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, it is further decremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, no change is made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`.
   - If the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - m):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - m`.

Given that `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the states based on the new value of `i` (which will be 1).

4. **New States:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `cnt_b[a[1]]` will be incremented by 1 (since `i` is now 1).
   - `curr` will be decreased by 1.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless `curr` becomes greater than or equal to `k` during this iteration.

Since we don't have the exact values of `a`, `b_values`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the initial state of `curr` and `ans`, we can only update the states based on the loop variable `i`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 1
- `n - m` must be at least `m - 1` (this condition does not change)
- `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1
- `curr` is decreased by 1
- `ans` remains unchanged (unless `curr` becomes >= `k`)

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1, `ans` remains unchanged**
