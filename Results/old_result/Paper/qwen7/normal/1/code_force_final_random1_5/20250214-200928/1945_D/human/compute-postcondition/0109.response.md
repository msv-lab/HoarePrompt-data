Output State: **`total` is 0 plus the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -2, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. Since `v` is -2, `total` becomes `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
