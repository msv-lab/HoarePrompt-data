Output State: `i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `lk` must be greater than 3; `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `lk - 2`, meaning the loop has completed `lk - 2` iterations. The variable `lk` must be greater than 3 for the loop to run at least three times. The list `ans` will contain a sequence of powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\).
