Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 5. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus the value of `xx[n + 1][4]`. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'SS' or 'FS' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'SF' or 'FF' plus the value of `xx[i][3]` otherwise.
