The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be such that it satisfies this condition.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `new2[i]` is set to the maximum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`
- `new` array has its `(i+1)`-th element updated to be the minimum between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`
- `new[i]` is now the minimum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`
- `i` is now `i + 1`

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `len(a)`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i + 1 < len(a)`.

State: **`new2[i]` is set to the maximum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new` array has its `(i+1)`-th element updated to be the minimum between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new[i]` is now the minimum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `i` must be such that `i + 1 < len(a)`**
