Functionality: **The function processes a specified number of test cases (determined by the value of `t`). For each test case, it calls `func_14()` multiple times (the exact number determined by `func_10()`) and prints the result of each call to `func_14()` followed by a newline character. The final state of the program is that the standard output contains the results of these function calls, each on a new line.**
