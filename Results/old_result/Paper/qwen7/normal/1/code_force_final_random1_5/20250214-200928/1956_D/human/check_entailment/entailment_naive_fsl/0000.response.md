Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations. Specifically, the `func_3` function is not correctly calling the necessary functions to achieve the desired result. Here are the issues:

1. The `func_2` function is defined but not called in `func_3`.
2. The `func_1` function is defined but not used in `func_2` or `func_3`.
3. The `recursive_maximize_sum` function is defined but not called in `func_2`.

Moreover, the logic within `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. For instance, the condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` does not correctly determine whether the current subarray can be maximized to its full capacity. This condition should be checking if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum of the subarray, which is `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.

Additionally, the way the operations are being applied and recorded is incorrect. The operations should be recorded properly, and the array should be updated accordingly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for maximizing the sum of the array elements, and thus, it is incorrect.
