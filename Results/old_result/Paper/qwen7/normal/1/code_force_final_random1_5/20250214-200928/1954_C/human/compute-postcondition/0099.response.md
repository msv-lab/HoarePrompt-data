Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `new2[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`
   - `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head checks two conditions: `i < len(a)` and `a[i] == b[i]`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - The first condition is `i < len(a)`. Since `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - The second condition is `a[i] == b[i]`. We need to ensure this condition holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Ensuring the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - To satisfy `i < len(a)`, `i` should be less than `len(a)`. Since `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1` for the next iteration.
   - To satisfy `a[i] == b[i]`, `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]` at the start of the next iteration. 

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a) - 1` and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`
- `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]`

State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`, `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]`**
