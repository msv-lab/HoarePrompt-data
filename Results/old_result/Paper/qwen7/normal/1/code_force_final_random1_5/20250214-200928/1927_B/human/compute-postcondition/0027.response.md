Output State: `j` is less than or equal to `l`; `l` is an input integer; `ans` is a list with `l` elements where each element is the character from `alp` list located at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` subtracted by 1.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `l` (since the loop increments `j` until it reaches `l`), `l` remains the same as the input integer, and `ans` will be a list containing `l` elements. Each element in `ans` corresponds to the character from `alp` based on the count of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist starting from `rev_array[j]` to the end of `rev_array`, minus one.
