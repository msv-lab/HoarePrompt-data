Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `score` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `score` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `l`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `score` being set to 0.
