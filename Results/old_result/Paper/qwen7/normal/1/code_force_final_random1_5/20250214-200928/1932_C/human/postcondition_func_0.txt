The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. Then, it computes a series of intermediate values of `p`, which is the cumulative product of elements in `b` modulo `m`, and stores these values in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns the list `ans` containing these intermediate values in reverse order.
