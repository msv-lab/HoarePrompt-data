Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is `cnt_b[a[i]] + 1`, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr - 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement. If the condition `cnt_b[a[i]] > 0` is true, then `curr` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If the condition is false, the conditions specified in the else part do not apply since there is no else part in the provided code.
