Output State: **`total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, and the value of `total_points` is odd; `resultats` contains `-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `-1` to the list `resultats`. The initial state of `total_points` being `p1 + p2 + p3` and the fact that `total_points` is odd remain unchanged. The only new information is that the list `resultats` now contains the value `-1`.
