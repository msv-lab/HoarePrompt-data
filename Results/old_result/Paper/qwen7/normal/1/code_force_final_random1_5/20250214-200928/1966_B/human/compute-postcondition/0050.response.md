Output State: `impossible` is False, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 2, and for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` must hold true.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `impossible` remains `False`, indicating that the conditions within the loop were satisfied for all consecutive pairs of rows in the grid `gr`. The value of `ans` remains `'NO'`, and the size of the grid `n` must be greater than 2. Additionally, for each pair of consecutive rows in the grid (from the first row to the second-to-last row), at least one of the first elements or the last elements of these rows must be different.
