Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 7, `l` is int(data[idx]), `r` is int(data[idx + 1]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `results` remains unchanged, and `v2` is reassigned to `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: The code updates `it1` to be the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to keep it sorted using `bisect.bisect_left`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
