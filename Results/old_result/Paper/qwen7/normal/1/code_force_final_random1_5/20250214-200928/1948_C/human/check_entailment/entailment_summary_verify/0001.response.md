### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several flaws in the provided program, particularly in the `func_1` function. The assessment concluded that the logic in `func_1` was overly restrictive and did not fully account for all possible valid paths the robot could take. The suggested corrected program provided a more comprehensive approach by simulating the robot's movement through the grid and checking if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

However, upon closer inspection, the original assessment did not fully capture the complexity of the problem. The key issue with the original program is indeed the flawed logic in `func_1`, but the suggested corrected program also has some issues that make it incomplete.

#### Issues with the Suggested Corrected Program

1. **Infinite Loop**: The suggested corrected program uses a while loop that does not have a clear termination condition. If the robot gets stuck in a loop or fails to reach the target, the loop will continue indefinitely.
2. **Movement Logic**: The logic for moving the robot is somewhat convoluted and does not fully simulate the robot's movement according to the arrows. It assumes that the robot will always move in a specific pattern, which may not be the case.
3. **Edge Cases**: The suggested corrected program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the robot gets stuck in a loop or when it cannot move due to the arrows.

### Correct Approach

A more robust solution would involve a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible paths the robot can take. This ensures that all valid paths are considered, and the robot's movement is accurately simulated.

Here is a more comprehensive and correct approach using BFS:

```python
from collections import deque

def can_reach_target(n, row1, row2):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(1, 1)])  # Start at (1, 1)
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
        visited.add((x, y))
        if x == 2 and y == n:
            return True
        next_moves = []
        if x == 1:
            if y < n and row1[y] == '>':
                next_moves.append((1, y + 1))
            if y > 1 and row1[y - 1] == '<':
                next_moves.append((1, y - 1))
            if y < n and row2[y] == '>':
                next_moves.append((2, y + 1))
            if y > 1 and row2[y - 1] == '<':
                next_moves.append((2, y - 1))
        else:  # x == 2
            if y < n and row2[y] == '>':
                next_moves.append((2, y + 1))
            if y > 1 and row2[y - 1] == '<':
                next_moves.append((2, y - 1))
            if y < n and row1[y] == '>':
                next_moves.append((1, y + 1))
            if y > 1 and row1[y - 1] == '<':
                next_moves.append((1, y - 1))
        for nx, ny in next_moves:
            if (nx, ny) not in visited:
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return False

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append('Yes' if can_reach_target(n, row1, row2) else 'No')
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The original program was incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`. The suggested corrected program, while an improvement, still had issues. A more robust solution using BFS ensures that all possible paths are explored accurately.
