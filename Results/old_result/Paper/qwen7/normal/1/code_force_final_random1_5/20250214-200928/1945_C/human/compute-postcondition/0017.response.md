Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 because `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`.
   - `n` is given as an input integer.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, the loop will run until `i` reaches `n - 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it needs to be set to 0.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` should be less than `n - 1`. Hence, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`**
