Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `impossible` is True, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string from the loop's `append` method, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the character at index `m-1` of the last string in `gr'
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m - 1):
    if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
        impossible = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `impossible` is True if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, and `impossible` is True if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, and `impossible` is True if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
