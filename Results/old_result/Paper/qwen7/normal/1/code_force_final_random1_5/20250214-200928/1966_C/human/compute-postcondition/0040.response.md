Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1; `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`**

Explanation: The variable `dp` is assigned a boolean value based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, the expression `arr[i] - arr[1 + 1]` simplifies to `arr[1] - arr[2]`. The value of `dp` is now determined by this condition, while `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
