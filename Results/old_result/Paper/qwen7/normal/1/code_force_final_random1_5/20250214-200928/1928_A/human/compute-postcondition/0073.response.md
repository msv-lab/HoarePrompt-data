Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it checks whether either `a` or `b` is even. If one of them is even and its half equals the other number, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any specific value but ensures that `t` is 0 and `a` and `b` retain their final values from the last iteration.**
