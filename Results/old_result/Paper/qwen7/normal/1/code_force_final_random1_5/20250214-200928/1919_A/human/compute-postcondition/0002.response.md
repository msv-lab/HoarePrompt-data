State: **`t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `results` is an empty list, `_` is not relevant as it is a placeholder index**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder index) and `t`, which controls the number of iterations.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000 because the loop runs `t` times.
- The variable `results` is not directly involved in the loop condition but might be modified inside the loop, so its initial state is noted.
- The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is just used to iterate over the range and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
