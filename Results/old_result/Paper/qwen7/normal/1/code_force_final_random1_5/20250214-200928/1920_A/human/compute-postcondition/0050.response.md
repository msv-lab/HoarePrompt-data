Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`, and `num` is a list containing `[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `end = v` simply assigns the value of `v` to the variable `end`. Since `v` was previously equal to `start`, and the condition that `start` is less than `v` remains unchanged, the value of `end` is now explicitly set to `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
