You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\) if `m < a`, or \((y + 1) // 2\) otherwise, where `m` is \(15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2) - y \cdot 4\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells must be filled optimally. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input `x = 12` and `y = 4`. According to the problem description, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2 on the minimum number of screens. Each screen has 15 cells (5x3 grid).

The correct approach would be to first place the 2x2 icons, which occupy 4 cells each. Since we have 4 such icons, they will occupy \(4 \times 4 = 16\) cells in total, but since each screen has only 15 cells, we need at least 2 screens to place these 4 icons (one screen will have 4 icons, and the other will have 1 icon).

After placing the 2x2 icons, we have 12 - 1 = 11 cells left to fill with 1x1 icons. These 11 cells can fit into one additional screen.

Therefore, the minimum number of screens needed is 2.

However, the given program calculates the number of screens as follows:
- It calculates \(z = (y + 1) // 2\), which is the number of full 2x2 icons plus one extra space.
- It then calculates \(m = 15 * z - y * 4\), which is the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
- Finally, it checks if \(m < a\) and adjusts the number of screens accordingly.

This approach is flawed because it does not ensure the optimal placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. For the given input `x = 12` and `y = 4`, the program incorrectly outputs 1 instead of 2.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
