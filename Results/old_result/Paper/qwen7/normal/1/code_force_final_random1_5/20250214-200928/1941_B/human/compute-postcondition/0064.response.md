Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, and the value of `a[i]` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` subtracts `opNum` from `a[i]`. Given that `opNum` is equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` is less than 0, after the operation, `a[i]` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
