Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ai in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ai` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `year` was set to `ai`, which is the smallest element in the list `a`. The variable `t` remained unchanged, and `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - **`ai`**: This variable changes with each iteration of the loop. At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` was the smallest element in the list `a`.
   - **`a`**: The list `a` loses its smallest element (which was `ai`) at the end of each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `a` must still contain at least one element.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `ai` will be the next smallest element in the list `a`.
- `a` must still contain at least one element.

Since `t` and `n` remain unchanged, we do not need to adjust their values.

**Final State**:
State: **`year` is the next smallest element in the list `a`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining**.
