Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]] = []` assigns an empty list to the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. This does not affect the values of `a[i]`, `idx`, or `pf[i]`, but it changes the value of `mp[pf[i]]` to an empty list.
