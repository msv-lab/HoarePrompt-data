Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[-1, n, n]`, and `n` is set to the value of `previous[-1]`. If `n == -1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Initially, `path_ba` contains `[-1, n]`. After appending `n`, `path_ba` becomes `[-1, n, n]`. The values of `d`, `previous`, `b`, and the condition for breaking out of the loop remain unchanged.
