Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of calling the function `func_1` with the argument `d` to the variable `b`. The values of `d` and `previous` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `d` remains the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` remains the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, and `b` is now the result of `func_1(d)`.
