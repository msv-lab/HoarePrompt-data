Output State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `A` is initially set to `True`. The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to `False`. All other variables (`arr[0]`, `set_`, `i`, `not_c`) remain unchanged.
