Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in lst:`. This means the variables `ele` and `lst` are the ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`. At the end of each iteration, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must have at least one element.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is the current element being processed in the loop, it will change to the next element in `lst` for the next iteration.
   - `mini` will be updated based on the new `ele` and `pk`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `lst` must still have at least one element (since we are iterating through it).
   - `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the new `ele`.

Given that `ele` changes to the next element in `lst` and `mini` is updated, the new state should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the next element in `lst`**.
