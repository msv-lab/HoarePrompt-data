Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input data correctly and processes it according to the problem statement.
2. It initializes necessary variables and structures (like `a`, `pf`, and `mp`) to store the array values, prefix XOR values, and mapping of prefix XOR values to their indices.
3. The main logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is implemented correctly. It uses the prefix XOR technique to find potential split points efficiently.
4. The use of binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) helps in quickly finding the relevant indices in the mapped prefix XOR values.
5. The program constructs the results list properly and prints the output in the required format.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic and handles all aspects of the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**
