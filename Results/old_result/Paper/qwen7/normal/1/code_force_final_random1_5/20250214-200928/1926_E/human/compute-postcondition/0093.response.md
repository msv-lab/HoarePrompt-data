Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 32, `m` is 1, `n` is 0**

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` (which is 1) to the list `L`. Initially, `L` is `[2]`. After appending `m`, `L` becomes `[2, 1]`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `tot`, `k`, `pow`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
