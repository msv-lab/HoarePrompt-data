Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` from being an unspecified integer within the range 1 to 1000 to the actual integer input. However, the lengths and initializations of the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged. Therefore, these lists retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
