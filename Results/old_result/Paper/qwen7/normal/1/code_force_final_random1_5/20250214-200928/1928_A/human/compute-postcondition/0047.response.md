Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2` are integers from the input.
- `b1` is half of `b`.
- `b2` is half of `b`.
- If `b1` is equal to `a`, the loop does not continue. Otherwise, it continues.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('No')
```

Given the conditions and the print statement, the output will be the string 'No', regardless of the values of the other variables since the print statement directly outputs this string without referencing any of the other variables.

Output: **No**
