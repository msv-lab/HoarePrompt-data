Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, and input is converted to a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the condition that each integer in `a` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7 still holds true.
