Output State: **`x` is an array, `j` is `j + 1`, `a[i]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of array `a` by 1. The initial state mentions that `x` is an array, and `j` is `j + 1`. Since no changes are made to `x` and `j` in the given code, their states remain unchanged. The only change is that the value at index `i` of array `a` is incremented by 1.
