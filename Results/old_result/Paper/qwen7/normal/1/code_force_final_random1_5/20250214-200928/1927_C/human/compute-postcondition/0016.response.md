Postcondition: `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is present in both `a` and `b`. If the number of ones in `a` is less than the number of ones in `b`, `aOnes` becomes 1; otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0.
