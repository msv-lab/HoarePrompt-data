Output State: **`rest` is reduced by `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is unchanged, and `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The variable `delta` is assigned the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The value of `rest` is reduced by this minimum value. The value of `pos` remains the same as it was in the initial state since no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
