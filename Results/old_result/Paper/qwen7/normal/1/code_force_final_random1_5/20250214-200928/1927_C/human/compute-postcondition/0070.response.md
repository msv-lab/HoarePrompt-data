Output State: **`aOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `a` that are also in list `b` and do not exceed `newk` in count; `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is updated to `t + 1`; `a` is now a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces; `i` is equal to `k + 1`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged except for `t`, which is incremented by 1.
