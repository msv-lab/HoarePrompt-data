Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `len(arr)` must be greater than 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `i` is set to `n`, which means `i` is the last index of the array `arr`.
   - `dp` is determined by the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`. Here, `arr[n-1]` refers to the last element of the array, and `arr[n]` refers to the element just before the last one.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement checks if `dp` is `True` and prints `'Alice'` if it is, otherwise it prints `'Bob'`.

Given that `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and `len(arr)` is greater than 1, we know that `arr` has at least two elements. Let's denote the elements of `arr` as `arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-1], arr[n]`.

The key part is the condition for `dp`:
- If `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`, then `dp` will be `True`.
- Otherwise, `dp` will be `not dp`, meaning it will be the opposite of whatever `dp` was previously.

Since `i` is set to `n`, the condition for `dp` is based on the comparison between the last two elements of `arr`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The output will depend on the values of `arr[n-1]` and `arr[n]`.
   - If `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`, then `dp` will be `True`, and the print statement will output `'Alice'`.
   - Otherwise, `dp` will be `False`, and the print statement will output `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output will be based on the comparison of the last two elements of the array `arr`.

Output: **'Alice' if arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 else 'Bob'**
