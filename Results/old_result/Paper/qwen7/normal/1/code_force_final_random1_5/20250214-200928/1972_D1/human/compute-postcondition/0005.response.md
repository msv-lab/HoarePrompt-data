Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `func_15()` returns a positive integer that is one less than its previous value, `sys.stdout.write` writes the value of `func_15()` plus a newline character.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` calls the function `func_15()`, converts its return value to a string, and writes it to the standard output followed by a newline character. However, since the exact return value of `func_15()` is not specified in the initial state, we only know that it returns a positive integer that is one less than its previous value. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the output will be the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline.
