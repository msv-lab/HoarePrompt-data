Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `feat`, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `arr` by converting each element of the input (split by spaces) into integers. This operation does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `i`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and the newly created list `arr` is added to the state.
