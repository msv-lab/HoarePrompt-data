Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1 or 2.
   - `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `x` is an input string (this variable is not involved in the loop head).
   - `j` is 2.
   - `b[1]` is 3 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `b[2]` is 3.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 3.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently 2 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, it stays the same.

7. **Update the State**:
   - `i` remains 1 or 2.
   - `n` remains within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `x` remains an input string.
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `b[1]` remains 3 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `b[2]` remains 3.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `x` is an input string; `j` is 3; `b[1]` is 3 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `b[2]` is 3.**
