Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `range(2, l)`, which means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `l`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 3
   - `ans` is [4, 8]

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `l`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `l` remains the same because it is derived from the length of `b` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `l` remains the same (length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 3).
   - `ans` is not affected by the loop and remains [4, 8].

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is [4, 8]**
