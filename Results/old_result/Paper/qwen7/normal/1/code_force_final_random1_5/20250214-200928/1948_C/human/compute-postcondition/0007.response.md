Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- Either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] is '<' and b[i + 1] is '<')` or `(a[i] is '<' and b[i - 1] is '<')`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

1. `i` is set to 1.
2. For the condition to be true, one of the following must hold:
   - `(i + 1 < n and a[i] is '<' and b[i + 1] is '<')`: This translates to `(1 + 1 < n and a[1] is '<' and b[2] is '<')` or simply `(2 < n and a[1] is '<' and b[2] is '<')`.
   - `(a[i] is '<' and b[i - 1] is '<')`: This translates to `(a[1] is '<' and b[0] is '<')`.

Since `i` is 1, the second condition simplifies to checking if `a[1]` is `<` and `b[0]` is `<`. If this condition is true, it means the first character of `a` is `<` and the first character of `b` is `<`.

Regardless of the specific values of `a` and `b`, the print statement is fixed and does not depend on their values. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **No**
