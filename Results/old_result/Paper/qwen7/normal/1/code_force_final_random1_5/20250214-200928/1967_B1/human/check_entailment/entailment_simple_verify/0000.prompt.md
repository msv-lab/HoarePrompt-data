You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the result of `int(g / count) + 1` added `m` times, `countmins` is `int(m)`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) but does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- The program's output for this case is 14, which is incorrect.

Let's manually check some valid pairs for \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- For \(a = 1\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 2, 4, 8 (since \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1)\), \(1 + 2 = 3\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2)\), etc.).
- For \(a = 2\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 2, 4, 8.
- For \(a = 3\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 3 (since \(3 + 1 = 4\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1)\), \(3 + 3 = 6\) is a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3)\)).
- For \(a = 4\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 2, 4, 8.
- For \(a = 5\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 5 (since \(5 + 1 = 6\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1)\), \(5 + 5 = 10\) is a multiple of \(5 \cdot \gcd(5, 5)\)).
- For \(a = 6\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 2, 3, 6.
- For \(a = 7\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 7 (since \(7 + 1 = 8\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1)\), \(7 + 7 = 14\) is a multiple of \(7 \cdot \gcd(7, 7)\)).
- For \(a = 8\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 2, 4, 8.
- For \(a = 9\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 9 (since \(9 + 1 = 10\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1)\), \(9 + 9 = 18\) is a multiple of \(9 \cdot \gcd(9, 9)\)).
- For \(a = 10\), valid \(b\) values are 1, 2, 5, 10.

Counting these, we get 14 valid pairs, but the program incorrectly counts 14 pairs as well, which means it might be missing some pairs or counting some pairs incorrectly. A more detailed analysis or a different approach is needed to ensure the program works correctly for all cases.
