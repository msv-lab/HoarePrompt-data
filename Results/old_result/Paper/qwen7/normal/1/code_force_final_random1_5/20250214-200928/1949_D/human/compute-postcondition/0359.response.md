Output State: **`nx` is a string equal to its previous value plus `xx[n][1]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 4.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (where `i` is `n` and `j` is 2) to the string `nx`. Since `j - 1` equals 1, it accesses the second element of the list `xx[n]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
