Output State: **`j` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the `(rev_array[1:].count(rev_array[1]) - 1)`-th element of `alp` and the second element is the `(rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)`-th element of `alp`, and `ans` has its second element appended with the value of `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `ans` list the value of `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`. Since `j` is 2, the expression `rev_array[j:]` refers to `rev_array[2:]`. The count of `rev_array[2]` in `rev_array[2:]` is determined, and then the corresponding element in `alp` is appended to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
