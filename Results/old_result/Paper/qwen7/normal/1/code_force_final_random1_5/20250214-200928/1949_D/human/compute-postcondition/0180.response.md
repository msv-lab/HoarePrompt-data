Output State: **`j` is 3, `nx` is 'S', `n` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string 'S' to the variable `nx`. Since no initial value for `nx` was given, it is assumed to be an empty string `''` before the operation. After appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S'. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 3, and the condition that `n` is greater than 0 is still valid.
