Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is equal to `B[r - 1] - B[x]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `B[x]` from its current value. Here, `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`. Since `B[r - 1]` was previously equal to `B[r - 1]`, and `x` remains unchanged, the new value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. All other variables remain in their original states.
