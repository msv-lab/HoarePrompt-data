Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a1` is an integer from the input, `a2` is an integer from the input, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`. If `b1` is equal to `a`, the loop does not continue. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, we continue the loop or process. If the condition `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` is true, `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input, and `b1` and `b2` are as defined. If the condition is false, `b1` and `b2` are still half of `b`.
