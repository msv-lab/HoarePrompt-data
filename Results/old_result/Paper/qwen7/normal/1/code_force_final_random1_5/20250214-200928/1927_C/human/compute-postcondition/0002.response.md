Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input string but their specific values are not known without further input.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not directly modified by this code, so they retain their original values from the initial state. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
