### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description and Constraints:
- We have an \( n \times m \) grid where each cell is either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black).
- An operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It checks if the top-left cell is the same as the bottom-right cell.
- If they differ, it further checks if the first row or the last column can be uniform without changing the top-left and bottom-right cells.
- Based on these checks, it determines whether it's possible to make the top-left and bottom-right cells the same by flipping rows or columns, and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**: The program starts by checking if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is the same as the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`). If they differ, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
2. **Row and Column Checks**: If the top-left and bottom-right cells differ, it then checks if the first row or the last column can be uniform without changing the top-left and bottom-right cells. This is done by iterating through the first row and the last column, ensuring that all adjacent cells in these rows and columns are the same.

However, the function summary suggests a more comprehensive approach is needed. The program only checks the first row and the last column, which is insufficient for determining if the entire grid can be made uniform.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
B W B
W B W
B W B
```
- The top-left cell is 'B' and the bottom-right cell is 'B', so the initial check passes.
- The first row and last column do not help in determining the uniformity of the entire grid.
- The program would incorrectly output 'YES' because it does not consider other possible configurations that could make the grid uniform.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the grid can be made uniform, the program should check if there is any row or column that is entirely uniform. If such a row or column exists, then the entire grid can be made uniform by performing operations along that row or column.

#### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible configurations that could make the grid uniform. The original assessment was accurate in pointing out the flaw in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
