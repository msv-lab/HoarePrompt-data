Output State: **`ind` is 1 more than the previous value, `line` is a string, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`, `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`**

Explanation: The code `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` sets the value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. All other variables (`ind`, `line`, `elements[line[ind]]`, `tmp`, and `goal`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the condition specified.
