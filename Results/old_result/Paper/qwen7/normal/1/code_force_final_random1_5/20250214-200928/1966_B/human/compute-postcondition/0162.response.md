Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the top-left cell is the same as the bottom-right cell. If they differ, it further checks if the first row or the last column can be uniform without changing the top-left and bottom-right cells. Based on these checks, it determines whether it's possible to make the top-left and bottom-right cells the same by flipping rows or columns, and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.**
