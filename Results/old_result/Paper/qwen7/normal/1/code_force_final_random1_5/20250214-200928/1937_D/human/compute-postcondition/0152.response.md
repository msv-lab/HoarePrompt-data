Output State: **`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

This means that the value of `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`. The other variables retain their previous conditions and values as described in the initial state.
