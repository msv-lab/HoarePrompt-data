Output State: **`i` is 2; `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is 0; `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `curr -= 1` decreases the value of `curr` by 1. Given that `curr` was initially decreased by 1 from its previous state, and now it is further decreased by 1, `curr` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
