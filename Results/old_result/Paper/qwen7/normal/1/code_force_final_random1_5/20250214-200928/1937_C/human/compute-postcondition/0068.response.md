Output State: `best` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is 5, `res` is an input string and its current value is '<'.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 2 up to but not including `n`. Given that the loop has executed three times and considering the condition in the loop (`res == '<'`), `k` remains 5 throughout. Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, once `i` reaches or exceeds `n`, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be greater than or equal to `n`, while `k` remains unchanged at 5, and `res` remains unchanged at '<'.
