Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is `t` (an input integer), `v` is `v` (an input integer), `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`, and `num` is a list containing `[v]`**.

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `t` and `v` respectively. The initial values of `i`, `n`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged, and the list `num` is updated to contain the new value of `v`. The values of `t` and `v` are now specific inputs from the user, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
