Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (t, x) are distinct; `n` is now an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial constraints on `n` are that it is an integer between 2 and 100, inclusive, and the rest of the conditions remain unchanged, these constraints still apply. The input integer replaces the placeholder value of `n`, but the range and other conditions are preserved.
