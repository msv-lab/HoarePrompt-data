Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `m += b[s - 1]` increments the value of `m` by `b[s - 1]`. Since the initial value of `m` was 0, after executing this line, `m` becomes `b[s - 1]`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `ql` remain unchanged from their initial states.
