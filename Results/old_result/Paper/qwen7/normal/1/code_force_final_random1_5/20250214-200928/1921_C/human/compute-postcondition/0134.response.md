Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is 1; the value of `array2` is appended with (arr[2] - arr[1]) * a**

Explanation: The code attempts to append a value to `array2`. However, the values of `arr`, `a`, `i`, and `n` are not provided. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `n` is 1, the code tries to access `arr[2]` and `arr[1]`. Since these values are not specified, the expression `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` is left unevaluated. The only thing we know for certain is that this expression's result will be appended to `array2`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
