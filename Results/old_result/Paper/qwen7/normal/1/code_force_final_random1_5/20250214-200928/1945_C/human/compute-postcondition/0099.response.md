Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head consists of the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `pk` remains unchanged (not relevant for this adjustment).
   - `mini` is 100000000.
   - `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, with an additional element based on the condition `c1 >= 50`.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `sl` is a list containing all characters of the input string `s`.
   - `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`.
   - `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`.
   - `zero` is 0.
   - `one` is 0.
   - `lst` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` and will run until `i < n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
