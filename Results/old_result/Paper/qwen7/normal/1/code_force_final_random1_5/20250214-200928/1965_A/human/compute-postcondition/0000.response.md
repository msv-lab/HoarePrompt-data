Output State: **A is False**

The initial state defines that `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and `A` is set to `False`. The given code snippet simply initializes `A` to `False` without changing its value or performing any operations that would affect the list `arr` or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `A` remains `False`.
