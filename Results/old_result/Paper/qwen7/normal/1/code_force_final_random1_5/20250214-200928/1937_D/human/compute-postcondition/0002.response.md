Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of characters '<' and '>'; `A` is an empty list; `idx_A` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `idx_A = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `idx_A`. The initial states of `s` and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` is still a string of length `n`, consisting only of characters '<' and '>'; `A` is still an empty list; and `idx_A` is now an empty list.
