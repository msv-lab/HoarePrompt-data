Output State: **`n` is at least 9, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12, `y` is 4, `x` is 2, and `cnt` is 1 because `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
