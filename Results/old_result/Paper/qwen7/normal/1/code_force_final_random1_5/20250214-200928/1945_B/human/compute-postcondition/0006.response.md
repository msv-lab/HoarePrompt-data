Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.

We also know that the current value of `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1.

Let's break down the expression `mn // a + mn // b + 1`:

1. `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`.
2. Since `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, `mn` is also divisible by both `a` and `b`.
3. `mn // a` gives the quotient when `mn` is divided by `a`.
4. `mn // b` gives the quotient when `mn` is divided by `b`.
5. Adding 1 to the sum of these quotients gives us the desired output.

Given that `mn` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \text{quotient of } (min(a, b) + m) \div a + \text{quotient of } (min(a, b) + m) \div b + 1 \]

Since `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, the quotients are simply the integer division results of `min(a, b)` divided by `a` and `b`, plus the quotient of `m` divided by `a` and `b`.

Thus, the expression evaluates to:

\[ \left(\frac{min(a, b)}{a} + \frac{m}{a}\right) + \left(\frac{min(a, b)}{b} + \frac{m}{b}\right) + 1 \]

This simplifies further to:

\[ \frac{min(a, b)}{a} + \frac{m}{a} + \frac{min(a, b)}{b} + \frac{m}{b} + 1 \]

Since `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, the terms involving `m` simplify to just the integer division results of `m` divided by `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **(min(a, b) // a + m // a + min(a, b) // b + m // b + 1)**
