Output State: **`total` contains the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, and `v` is -1**.

The code reads two integers from the input using `input().split()` and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final` respectively. Since the initial values of `total`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `v` are provided, these values are updated to the input integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
