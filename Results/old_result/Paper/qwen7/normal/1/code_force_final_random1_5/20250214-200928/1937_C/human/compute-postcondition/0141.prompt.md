You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires the function to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves finding a pair of indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most 3n queries. The function must interact with an external entity to ask queries and receive responses. The variable n is an integer representing the size of the permutation, and t is an integer representing the number of test cases.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        k = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n):
            print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                k = i
        
        best = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                best = i
        
        print('!', k, best, flush=True)
        
    #State: Output State: `best` is 5, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `k` is 5, and `res` is an input string.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i=2` to `i=n-1`. Given that the loop has executed all its iterations, it means `i` has reached `n-1` and the loop has completed. Therefore, `i` is now equal to `n`. The value of `best` remains 5 because it was updated to the last value of `i` (which is 5) during the loop's execution. The value of `k` remains 5 as it is only updated inside the loop when `res` is '<', and since `res` was always '<' in the previous iterations, `k` was updated to the current value of `i` (which is 5) in the last iteration. The value of `n` must be greater than 1 as it is the size of the permutation, and `res` remains an input string as it is read from the input in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but interacts with an external entity to find pairs of indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most 3n queries for each test case. It handles multiple test cases where n is the size of the permutation and t is the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns the maximum \( p_i \oplus p_j \) found.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
