Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` has been incremented by 1.
   - `r` is `r - 1`: This means `r` has been decremented by 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0: `n` is still a positive integer.
   - `l` remains the same: `l` has not changed.
   - `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`: Here, `a` is computed using the last element of the list `B` adjusted by the difference between `idx_B[r - 1]` and `i`, then multiplied by `r`.
   - `b` is `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`: Here, `b` is updated by subtracting a term involving the indices of `idx_A` and adding another term involving `i`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `a * 2 + b * 2` simplifies to `(a + b) * 2`.
   - We need to find the value of `a + b` and then multiply it by 2.
   - `(n - i)` is the remaining count of elements after `i` has been incremented.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`
   - `b` is updated but its exact value depends on the previous state of `b` and the changes made to it.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `r` is now `r - 1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The expression `(a + b) * 2 + (n - i)` will be evaluated and printed.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, `n - i` will be a value less than `n`.

Given the above steps and the initial state, the output will be:

Output: **(a + b) * 2 + (n - i) (where a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is updated based on previous state, n is a positive integer, and i is i + 1)**
