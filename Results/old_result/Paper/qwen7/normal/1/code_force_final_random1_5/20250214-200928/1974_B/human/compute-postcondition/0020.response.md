Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `char` which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - If `char` is found in `unique_chars`, then `char` is replaced by `unique_chars[j]` in `s`, `j` is decreased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1.
   - If `char` is not found in `unique_chars`, then `j` is increased by 1, `unique_chars` is updated to include `char`, and `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `char` is the next character in `s`.
   - `unique_chars` is a list containing unique characters from `s`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `char` is the next character in `s`, it means that the current character has already been processed. For the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in `s`.
   - `unique_chars` might have been updated if `char` was not found in `unique_chars` during the previous iteration.
   - `j` and `i` will be incremented based on the conditions inside the loop.

Given the above points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `char` will be the next character in `s`.
- `unique_chars` might have been updated, but its exact state depends on the condition inside the loop.
- `j` and `i` will be incremented.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` and `i` after the previous iteration, we can only say that they will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `s`, `unique_chars` is a list containing unique characters from `s`, `j` is increased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1**.
