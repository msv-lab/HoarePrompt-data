Output State: **`x` is equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is increased by 1, `p` contains the value `i+1`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Since `j` is increased by 1, the list `c` now contains the value of `j`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
