Postcondition: **`A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Since the `if` condition `not_c` is `False`, the `else` part is not executed, and the postcondition retains the state where `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, and `not_c` is False after the loop has been executed 3 times.
