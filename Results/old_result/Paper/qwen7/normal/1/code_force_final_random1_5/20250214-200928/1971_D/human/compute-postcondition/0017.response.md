Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with length greater than 1, `flag` is True, `j` is 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is '1' while the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The current character `s[j]` which was '0' before, now becomes '1', and the next character `s[j + 1]` also remains '1'.
