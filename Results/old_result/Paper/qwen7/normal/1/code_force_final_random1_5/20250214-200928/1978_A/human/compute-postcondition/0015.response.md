Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book for each test case. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the number of pages in each book. The function returns information based on the given data for each test case.**

This means the function will take a structured input consisting of multiple test cases, each containing the number of books and their respective page counts, and process this data according to the specified constraints. However, since the exact processing logic isn't detailed here, the focus is on the structure and nature of the input and expected output format.
