Output State: `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `power` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than `n`. Given that the loop has executed all iterations, `power` will eventually become equal to or greater than `n`. Since `i` increments by 1 each time the loop runs and the loop runs at least 3 times, `i` will be 2. The other variables (`n_cases` and `power`) will maintain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
