The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n binary values. It then finds the first occurrence of '1' from the start and the end of the binary string, extracts the substring between these occurrences, and counts the number of zeros in this substring. The function prints the count of zeros for each test case and returns nothing.
