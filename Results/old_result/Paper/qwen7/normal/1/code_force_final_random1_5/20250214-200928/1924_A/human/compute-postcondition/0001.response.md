State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(t)` begins counting from 0.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 0.

Thus, the required state adjustments are that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
