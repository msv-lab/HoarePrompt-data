Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is a player, then `player` is `obj` if `obj` is a player, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is not a player. The current value of `obj` is `.B`.**
