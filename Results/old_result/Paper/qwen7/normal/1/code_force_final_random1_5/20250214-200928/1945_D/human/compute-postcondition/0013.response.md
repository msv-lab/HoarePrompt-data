Postcondition: `total` is 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true, or remains `best` (which is initially 10000000000) if the condition is false.
