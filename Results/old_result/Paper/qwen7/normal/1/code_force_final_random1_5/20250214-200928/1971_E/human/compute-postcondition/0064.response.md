Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` is len(a), `i` is 1, `s` is bisect_left(a, ql), `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 2**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` updates the value of `s` to be the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in the list `a`. The other variables (`m`, `q`, `i`, `ql`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
