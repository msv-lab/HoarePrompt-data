Output State: **`ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, i)` appended to it, `i` is previous_i + 1, `ci` must be greater than or equal to previous_i + 1**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is defined as `previous_i + 1`, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c, previous_i + 1)`. The conditions for `ci` remain unchanged, meaning `ci` must still be greater than or equal to `previous_i + 1`.
