Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `balance` is 1; `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` equal to 1, `i` value equal to 0, and `s[i]` value equal to '('**.

Explanation: The code increments the `balance` variable by 1. Initially, `balance` was part of the `balance_info` instance with its value derived from the current iteration and the value of `i` and `s[i]`. Since `s[i]` is '(', the `balance_info` remains unchanged except for the updated `balance` value which is now 1.
