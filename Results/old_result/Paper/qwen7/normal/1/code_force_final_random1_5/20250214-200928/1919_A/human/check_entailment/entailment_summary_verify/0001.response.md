### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Each player alternates turns.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep them.
   - After each move, one coin is removed from the player's current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, the first player (Alice) will lose if both players play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) will win if both players play optimally.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This function correctly implements the logic based on the key insight.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to determine the winner.
   - It prints the results for each test case.
   - This function correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the input handling in `func_2`. The function `input()` is used without any validation or error handling, which could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid input is provided.

6. **Input Handling Issue:**
   - The `input()` function in Python reads a string, and if the input is not a valid integer, it will raise a `ValueError`.
   - The code does not handle this exception, which means the program may crash if the user provides non-integer input.

### Conclusion:
While the logic implemented in both functions is correct based on the problem statement, the program is not robust because it lacks proper input validation and error handling. This could lead to runtime errors if the input is not as expected.

**Final: False**
