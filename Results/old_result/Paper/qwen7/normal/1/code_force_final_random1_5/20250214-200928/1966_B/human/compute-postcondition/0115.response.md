Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`, `impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`.**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `gr`. Since `gr` was initially an empty list, after appending the input, `gr` now contains one element, which is the input received from the user. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
