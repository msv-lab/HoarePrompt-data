The function `func_14` accepts four parameters: `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers (0 <= n and 0 <= m), and `k` is an integer.

Based on the output cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 1.
- Case_2: The function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_14` is to accept a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`, and return either 1 or -1 based on some condition within the function body.
