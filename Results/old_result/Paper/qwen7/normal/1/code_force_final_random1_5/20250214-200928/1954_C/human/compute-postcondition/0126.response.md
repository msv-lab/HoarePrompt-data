Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
- `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution.
- `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

This statement joins the elements of the list `new2` into a single string, converting each element to a string first. Since `new2` contains the maximum values where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]`, the output will be a string composed of these maximum values.

However, without the actual values of `a` and `b`, we cannot determine the exact content of `new2`. Therefore, the output will be a string composed of the maximum values from `a` and `b` where the corresponding elements were equal during the loop's execution.

Output: **a string composed of the maximum values from `a` and `b` where the corresponding elements were equal during the loop's execution**
