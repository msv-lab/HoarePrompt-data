Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`. This means the loop variable `i` will take values starting from 1 up to `n-2`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The initial state of `i` is given as `i` is 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-2`. Therefore, `i` must be at least 1 and less than `n-1`.

4. **Check the value of `n`**: Since `i` must be in the range from 1 to `n-2`, `n` must be at least 3 (because if `n` is less than 3, there won't be any valid `i` in the range).

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`l`, `d1`, `d2`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be at least 1.
- `n` should be at least 3.

So, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3**
