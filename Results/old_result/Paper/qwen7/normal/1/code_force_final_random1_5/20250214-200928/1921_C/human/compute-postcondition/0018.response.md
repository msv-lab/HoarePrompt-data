Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `total` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

6. **List the updated states**:
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
