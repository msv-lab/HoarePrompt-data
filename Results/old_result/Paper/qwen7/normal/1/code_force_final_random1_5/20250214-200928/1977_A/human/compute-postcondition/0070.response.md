Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers: t, n, and m, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers between 1 and 100. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned, but it processes these integers and may return different outputs based on their values, such as performing some operations or calculations with them.**

Given the constraints and the implied nature of the function, it appears the function might be processing multiple test cases defined by `t`, where for each `t`, it takes `n` and `m` as inputs and performs some operation. However, without explicit return statements in the problem description, we can only infer the parameters and the nature of the processing.
