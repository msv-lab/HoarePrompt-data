Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is [0], `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is '>'**

The code `A.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `A`, making `A` become `[0]`. The other variables (`s`, `idx_A`, `i`, and the current value of `s[i]`) remain unchanged.
