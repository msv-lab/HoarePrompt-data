Postcondition: `lst` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is now the third element of `lst`, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` contains the first four elements of `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` is updated to contain the first four elements of `lst`.
