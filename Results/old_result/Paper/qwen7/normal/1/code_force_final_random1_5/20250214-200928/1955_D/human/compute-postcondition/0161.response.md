Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1 minus 1, `ans` is 1, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

The code `curr -= 1` decrements the value of `curr` by 1. Since `curr` was defined as the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1, after decrementing, `curr` will be that count minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
