Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2(`n_cases`) and must be greater than 2, `power` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `power` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 3. The conditions and relationships between `n_cases`, `n`, and `power` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still log2(`n_cases`) and must be greater than 2, while `power` is now 3.
