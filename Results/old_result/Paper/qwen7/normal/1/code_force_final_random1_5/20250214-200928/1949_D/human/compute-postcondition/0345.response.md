Output State: **`nx` is now the string 'xx[i][j - 1]', `i` is n, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Since `j` is 1, the specific value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is used, making `nx` become the string consisting of that character. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
