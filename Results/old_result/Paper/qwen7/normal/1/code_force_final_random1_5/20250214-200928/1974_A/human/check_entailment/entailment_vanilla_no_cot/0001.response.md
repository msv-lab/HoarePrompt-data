Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens:**
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula calculates the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the available space, considering each 2x2 icon takes up 2 cells (since they occupy 4 cells but we need to fit them optimally).
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula determines the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. Here, `15` comes from the total capacity of a 5x3 grid (5 rows * 3 columns = 15 cells), and `y * 4` accounts for the space taken by the 2x2 icons.
   - If `m` (remaining space) is less than `a` (number of test cases), it means there are enough 1x1 icons to fill the remaining space. In this case, `z` is incremented by `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` to account for the additional screens needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `z`, which is the minimum number of screens needed.

### Testing the Logic

To verify the logic, let's consider some example scenarios:

- **Test Case 1: (1, 1)**
  - `y = 1` (one 2x2 icon), so `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`.
  - Since `m = 11` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 1`.

- **Test Case 2: (7, 2)**
  - `y = 2` (two 2x2 icons), so `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
  - Since `m = 7` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 1`.

- **Test Case 3: (12, 4)**
  - `y = 4` (four 2x2 icons), so `z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`.
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 4 * 4 = 22`.
  - Since `m = 22` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 2`.

- **Test Case 4: (0, 3)**
  - `y = 3` (three 2x2 icons), so `z = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`.
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 3 * 4 = 18`.
  - Since `m = 18` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 2`.

- **Test Case 5: (1, 0)**
  - `y = 0` (no 2x2 icons), so `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`.
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
  - Since `m = 0` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 1`.

- **Test Case 6: (8, 1)**
  - `y = 1` (one 2x2 icon), so `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`.
  - Since `m = 11` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 1`.

- **Test Case 7: (0, 0)**
  - `y = 0` (no 2x2 icons), so `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`.
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
  - Since `m = 0` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 0`.

- **Test Case 8: (2, 0)**
  - `y = 0` (no 2x2 icons), so `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`.
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
  - Since `m = 0` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 1`.

- **Test Case 9: (15, 0)**
  - `y = 0` (no 2x2 icons), so `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`.
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
  - Since `m = 0` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 1`.

- **Test Case 10: (8, 2)**
  - `y = 2` (two 2x2 icons), so `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
  - Since `m = 7` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 1`.

- **Test Case 11: (0, 9)**
  - `y = 9` (nine 2x2 icons), so `z = (9 + 1) // 2 = 5`.
  - `m = 15 * 5 - 9 * 4 = 45 - 36 = 9`.
  - Since `m = 9` is not less than `a = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `z = 5`.

### Conclusion

After testing various scenarios, the logic in the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
