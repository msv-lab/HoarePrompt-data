Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Key Function Analysis**:
   - **func_15()**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\) using a specific algorithm involving the greatest common divisor (gcd) and a summation process.
   - **func_16()**: This function processes each test case by reading the values of \(n\) and \(m\) and then calling `func_15()` to compute and print the result for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_15()**: The logic inside `func_15()` correctly implements the required calculation. It uses a loop to iterate through possible values of \(i\) and computes the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values. This approach ensures that all valid pairs \((a, b)\) are counted.
   - **func_16()**: The function `func_16()` correctly handles the input and output as specified. It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result for each case.

Given that the functions `func_15()` and `func_16()` are implemented correctly according to the problem statement and the provided example, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
