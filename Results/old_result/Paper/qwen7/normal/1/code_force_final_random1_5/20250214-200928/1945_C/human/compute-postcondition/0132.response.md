To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for ele in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here, the only object in the loop head is `ele` and the list `lst`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Initial State**: The loop has executed all iterations, and the final state includes:
   - `i` is equal to `n-2`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `zero` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `i`.
   - `one` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
   - `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
   - If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then the list `lst` will contain the value `i + 2`. Otherwise, `lst` will remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the list `lst` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `lst` to ensure it has at least one element.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

- **`lst`**: The list `lst` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. Since the loop iterates over each element in `lst`, `lst` must be non-empty.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`lst` must have at least one element.**

This ensures that the loop can execute at least once, given that `lst` is non-empty.
