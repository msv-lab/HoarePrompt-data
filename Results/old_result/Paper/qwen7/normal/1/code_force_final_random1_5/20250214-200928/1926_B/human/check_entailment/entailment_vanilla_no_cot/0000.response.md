Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape on the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Triangle Detection**: 
   - The program checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows is the same. This is incorrect because a triangle can have different counts of '1's in its rows.
   
2. **Square Detection**:
   - Similarly, the condition `if k[0] == k[1]:` is not sufficient for determining a square. For a square, the count of '1's should be the same across all rows within the square region.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly identify the shape, we need to check the structure of the grid more carefully:

- **Triangle**:
  - Check if the grid matches the pattern of a triangle by verifying the number of '1's in each row.
  
- **Square**:
  - Check if the grid matches the pattern of a square by verifying the number of '1's in each row and their positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if grid[i].count('1') != 2 * i + 1:
            return False
        if grid[n - 1 - i].count('1') != 2 * i + 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if grid[i].count('1') != n - 2 * i:
            return False
        if grid[n - 1 - i].count('1') != n - 2 * i:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print('TRIANGLE')
        elif is_square(grid):
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('NO SHAPE')

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the grid to determine if it forms a triangle or a square based on the patterns described in the problem statement.
