Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(3, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5.
   - The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 3 to `n` inclusive. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 5, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 6.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is now 6, `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 2 * (4 - 1) * dp[2]) % 1000000007`, `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6**
