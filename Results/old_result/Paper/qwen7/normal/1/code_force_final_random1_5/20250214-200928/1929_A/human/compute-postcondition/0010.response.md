Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ntest` is an input integer. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
   - `itest` is set to 1. This variable is also not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
   - `n` is an input integer from the user. This is the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces. Since `a` is sorted, the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is the largest integer in the list, and the first element (`a[0]`) is the smallest integer in the list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
   ```
   This line calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a` and prints it.

Given the initial state, the output will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`**
