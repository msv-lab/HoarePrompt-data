Postcondition: `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string), `i` is `n+1`, `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`, `impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, and `n` is at least 2. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` is true, `ans` is set to 'NO'. If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `ans` retains its original value of 'YES'.
