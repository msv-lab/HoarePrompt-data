Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(a)`, meaning `i` is the length of the list `a`.
- For every index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new[j]` contains the minimum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`.
- `new2[j]` contains the maximum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

This code will join all elements in the `new2` list into a single string, converting each element to a string first. Since `new2[j]` contains the maximum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`, the output will be a string where each character represents the maximum value between the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output will be a string composed of the maximum values from `a` and `b` concatenated together.

Output: **a string composed of the maximum values from `a` and `b` concatenated together**
