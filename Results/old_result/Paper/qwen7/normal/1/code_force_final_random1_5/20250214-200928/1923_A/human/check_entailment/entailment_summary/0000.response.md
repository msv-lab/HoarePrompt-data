Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Chip Block Distance**: The program attempts to find the first and last positions of '1' in the binary string representation of the array. However, it then extracts a substring `z` between these positions and simply counts the number of zeros in this substring. This approach does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to make all chips form a single block.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic to calculate the minimum number of operations should be based on moving chips to the nearest free cell to the left until all chips are adjacent. Counting zeros in the extracted substring does not reflect the actual number of operations needed.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`), the program outputs `1`, which is correct because moving the rightmost chip to the leftmost free cell achieves the goal in one operation.
   - However, for the second test case (`0 1 0 0 0 0`), the program outputs `0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `0` since the chips are already in a single block, but the logic fails to recognize this.
   - For the third test case (`1 1 1 1 1 1`), the program outputs `0`, which is correct.
   - For the fourth test case (`1 0 1 0 1`), the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because two operations are needed to move both chips to the leftmost position.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
