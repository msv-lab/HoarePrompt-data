### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided code based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Understanding the Balanced Shuffle Operation:**
   - The balanced shuffle operation involves computing the balance of each prefix of the input string.
   - These balances and their corresponding positions are stored in a list.
   - The list is then sorted based on the balance values (in ascending order) and, in case of ties, by position (in descending order).
   - The final sorted list is used to construct the shuffled sequence.

2. **Given Code Breakdown:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects. It returns the difference in balance or the difference in position if the balances are equal.
     - Since this function is not used in the main logic, it is likely an auxiliary function or part of the class definition.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function is the main function that performs the balanced shuffle operation.
     - It initializes the necessary variables and constructs a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It sorts this list using a custom key function that sorts by balance (ascending) and by position (descending).
     - Finally, it constructs the result string from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.

3. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere with the appropriate attributes (`balance`, `position`, and `character`).
   - The sorting key function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)` ensures that the list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when there is a tie.
   - The result is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects, which should give the desired shuffled sequence.

### Verification Using Function Summary

- **Function Summary:**
  - The function `func_2` processes a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")".
  - It calculates the balance of parentheses at each position.
  - It sorts the balance information based on the balance value and position.
  - It prints a new string formed by the characters in `s` but ordered according to the sorted balance information.

### Conclusion

Based on the provided code and the function summary, the implementation correctly follows the steps required for the balanced shuffle operation. The code computes the balance of each prefix, sorts the balance information, and constructs the shuffled sequence accordingly.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is correct and implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.
