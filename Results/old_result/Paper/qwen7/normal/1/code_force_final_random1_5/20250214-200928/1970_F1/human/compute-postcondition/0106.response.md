Postcondition: `line` is a string, `ind` is an index within the string `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is not `i, ind`, and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False. If the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing `(i, ind)`. If the condition `line[ind][1] == 'G'` is not met, no changes are made to `tmp` and `goal`.
