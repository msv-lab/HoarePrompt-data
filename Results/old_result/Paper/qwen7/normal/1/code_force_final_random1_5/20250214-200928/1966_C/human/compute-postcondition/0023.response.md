Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the range for `i` as `range(1, n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is defined as `range(1, n)`, the condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - `n` remains the same because the loop condition does not change `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `tc` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `dp` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop head.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`, and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.**
