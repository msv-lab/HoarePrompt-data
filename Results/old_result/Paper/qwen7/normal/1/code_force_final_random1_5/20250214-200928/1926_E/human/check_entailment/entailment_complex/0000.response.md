Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the process of laying out the cards according to the rules provided.
2. The logic for constructing the list `L` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 and appending the result is correct.
3. The loop that iterates over the list `L` and determines the `k-th` card to print is also correct. It correctly identifies the segment of the sequence where the `k-th` card falls and calculates the value accordingly.
4. The variable `pow` is used to keep track of the power of 2 corresponding to the current segment, which is correctly updated in each iteration.
5. The state at the end of the program matches the expected behavior, with `pow` being 128, indicating that the final segment corresponds to the highest power of 2 that fits into the remaining count of cards.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the `k-th` card laid down by Vladislav.

Correctness: **True**
