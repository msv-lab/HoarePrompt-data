Output State: **`results` is a list containing the missing values calculated for each test case in `test_cases`, where each missing value is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each element in `freq` for the corresponding test case.**

This means that for each tuple in `test_cases`, the program calculates the `missing` value based on the given formula and appends it to the `results` list. The final `results` list will contain `t` elements, each representing the `missing` value for each respective test case.
