Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. The function counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful, not just count the occurrences of "map" and "pie".

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie":
- The function would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 2 occurrences of "pie", resulting in a sum of 3.
- However, to make the string beautiful, we only need to remove 2 characters ('m' and 'e') to get "nap".

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
