Output State: **`l` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is 0, `idx_B` contains all indices where `s` has a '<' character from the last to the first, `B` is a list where each element is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `r` is the length of `B`.**

Explanation: The code `r = len(B)` calculates the length of the list `B` and assigns it to the variable `r`. The values of `l`, `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, and `B` remain unchanged from their initial states.
