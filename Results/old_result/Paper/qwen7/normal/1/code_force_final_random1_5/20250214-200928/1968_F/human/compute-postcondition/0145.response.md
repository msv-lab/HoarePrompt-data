Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` inserts `l` into the list `v1` while maintaining the sorted order and returns the index where `l` should be inserted. The values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, and `v2` are updated as described, and the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
