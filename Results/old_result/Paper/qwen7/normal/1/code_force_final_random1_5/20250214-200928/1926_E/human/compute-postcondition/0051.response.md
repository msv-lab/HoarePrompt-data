Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [4], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 8, `n` is `k` - (n + 1) // 2, `m` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, substituting `m` into the equation gives `n -= (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
