Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped. If `len(command)` is 3 and `command[2]` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[command[0]]` is set to True. Otherwise, `obj` is an element from the `command` list, `com` is an element from the `command` list, `el` is an element from the `command` list, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else `team` is 0; `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command)` is not 3, then `com` is a string from the command list, `obj` is a string from the `command` list, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the first element being `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element being `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, and `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
