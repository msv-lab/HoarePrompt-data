Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a1` equals `a2` which are both `a/2`, `b1` equals `b2` which are both `b//2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the condition remains as is; otherwise, no change is specified in the else part, so the values stay the same.
