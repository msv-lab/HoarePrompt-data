Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `v` and the range function arguments `na_frente`, `-1`, and `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `v` is the variable being iterated over.
   - `na_frente` is the starting point of the range.
   - The range function is defined as `range(na_frente, -1, -1)`, meaning `v` will take values from `na_frente` down to `-1` (inclusive).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `total` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `c` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `na_frente` must be an integer that allows the loop to start and iterate correctly.
   - The loop will execute as long as `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `na_frente`. It must be set to a value such that the loop can start and iterate correctly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is 10000000000**
