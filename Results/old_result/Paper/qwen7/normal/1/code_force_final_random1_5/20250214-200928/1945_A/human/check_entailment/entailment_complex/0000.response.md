Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct based on the problem statement.

2. **Variable Updates**: The program correctly updates `b` by adding `c` to it. This step is necessary because each universal can be paired with any type of person, and adding `c` to `b` simplifies the calculation of how many people need individual or shared tents.

3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `c < b % 3` to determine if it's possible to accommodate everyone. This condition ensures that there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts who cannot form a full tent with others. If this condition fails, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.

4. **Tent Calculation**: The program calculates the number of tents required using `(a - -b // 3)`. Here, `b // 3` gives the number of full tents that can be occupied by extroverts (since each extrovert needs a full tent with two others). The `- -b // 3` operation is equivalent to `b // 3 + 1` when `b % 3 > 0`, which correctly accounts for the remaining people needing individual tents.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the total number of people might exceed the constraints, but since the problem specifies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\), the program should handle these within the given limits.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and correctly computes the minimum number of tents needed or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

Correctness: **True**
