Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `feat`, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`, and the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is still true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 3, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is a list containing two elements where the first element is (arr[2] - arr[1]) * a, and the second element is (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a, and the condition arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a is still true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, and if `arr[4] - arr[3] < b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
