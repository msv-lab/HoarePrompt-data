Output State: **`y` is 0, `a_values` is a list containing integers from `max_p - 1` to 1 in descending order, `b_values` is a list containing the same integers, `custo` is the sum of elements from `a_values` and `b_values` as per the given conditions within the loop.**

Explanation:
- `y` is set to 0.
- `a_values` and `b_values` are lists containing integers from `max_p - 1` to 1 in descending order.
- `custo` is calculated by iterating through the elements of `a_values` and `b_values` according to the given condition: if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, then `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]`; otherwise, it is incremented by `a_values[y]`. If `y` reaches 1 and the condition is met, `custo` includes `a_values[0]`.
- The loop has completed all its iterations, and `custos.append(custo)` has added the final value of `custo` to the list `custos`. However, since the question asks for the final state of the variables, we focus on `y`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `custo`.
