Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[0] + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to an integer obtained from the user's input. The initial state of `i` being `n+1` and the list `a` defined by the given formula remains unchanged because no operation was performed on `i` or `a`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid since the input validation is not explicitly checked in the provided code snippet.
