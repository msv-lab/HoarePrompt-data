Postcondition: `ind` is now `line[ind]`, and `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player (i.e., `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true), then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, the player condition `(isPlayer(line[ind]))` is false, and if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is set to 0 and `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', no additional changes occur.
