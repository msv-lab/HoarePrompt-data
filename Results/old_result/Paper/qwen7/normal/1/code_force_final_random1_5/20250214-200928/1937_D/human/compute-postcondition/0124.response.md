To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expressions involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is increased by 1.
   - `r` is decreased by 1.
   - `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

Let's analyze each part:

- **`i`**: It is increased by 1, so `i = i + 1`.
- **`r`**: It is decreased by 1, so `r = r - 1`.

For `a`:
- `a` is defined as `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- Here, `A[l - 1]` is the element at index `l - 1` in the list `A`.
- `(0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` is the product of the negative of the element at index `l - 1` in the list `idx_A` and `l`.

For `b`:
- `b` is defined as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `B[r]` is the element at index `r` in the list `B`.
- `B[r - l]` is the element at index `r - l` in the list `B`.
- `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` is the product of the difference between the element at index `r - l` in the list `idx_B` and `i`, and the difference `r - l`.

Now, combining these into the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`:
- We need the precise values of `A[l - 1]`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, `B[r]`, `B[r - l]`, `idx_B[r - l]`, and `i` to evaluate this fully.

Given the lack of specific values for these variables, we can only describe the expression in terms of the variables themselves:
- `a = A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`
- `b = B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l >= 0`

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **2 * (A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) + 2 * (B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)) + i + 1** if `r - l >= 0`.
