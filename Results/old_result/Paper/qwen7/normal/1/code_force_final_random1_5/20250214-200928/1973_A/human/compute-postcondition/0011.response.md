The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the variables `total_matchs`, `total_points`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `resultats` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, and `resultats` contains `-1` and a list with one element `-1`.**
