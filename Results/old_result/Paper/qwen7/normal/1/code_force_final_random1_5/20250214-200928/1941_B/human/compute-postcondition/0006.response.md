Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The first element of `b` is even or both the first and second elements of `b` differ by 2, and the last element of `b` is even or both the second to last and last elements of `b` differ by 2.**
