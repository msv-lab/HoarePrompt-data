Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, and `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`.
- `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`.
- `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(l + 1, r + 1)
```

From the initial state, we know that `ops` contains at least one tuple, and since it's specified that there is a second tuple in `ops`, we can deduce the following:

- `l` is the first element of this second tuple.
- `r` is the second element of this second tuple.

However, the actual values of `l` and `r` are not explicitly given. They are derived from the operations performed by `func_2(a)`. Since the exact operations of `func_2(a)` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `l` and `r`.

Therefore, the output will be in terms of `l` and `r` as described above.

Output: **l + 1 r + 1 (where l and r are the first and second elements of the second tuple in ops respectively)**
