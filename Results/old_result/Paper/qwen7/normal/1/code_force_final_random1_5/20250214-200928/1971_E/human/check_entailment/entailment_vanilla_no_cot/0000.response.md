Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Speed Calculation**: It calculates the speed segments between the points in `a` and `b`. This is done by computing the differences in distances (`ad`) and times (`bd`), and then calculating the speed for each segment.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment and then calculates the exact time taken to reach the queried point `d` using linear interpolation between the speeds of the two segments.

4. **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, with each query's result on a new line.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program should work as expected for the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
