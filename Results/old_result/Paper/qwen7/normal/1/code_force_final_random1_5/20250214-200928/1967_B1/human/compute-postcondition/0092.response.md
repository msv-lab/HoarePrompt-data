Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is `int(count - 1)`, `g` is `int(n / count)`, if `g < countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
