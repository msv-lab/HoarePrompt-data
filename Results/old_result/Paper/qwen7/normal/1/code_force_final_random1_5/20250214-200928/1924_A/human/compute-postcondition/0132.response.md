Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is 0
   - `ans` is the entire string `s` concatenated in some order based on the conditions provided
   - `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution
   - `tmp` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'j' based on the conditions met in each iteration
   - `i` is equal to `k`
   - `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `k` and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1`.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`cur` is 0, `ans` is the entire string `s` concatenated in some order based on the conditions provided, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution, `tmp` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'j' based on the conditions met in each iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, and `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution.**
