Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `nx` is either equal to `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `j < n + 1`, for the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
   - `nx` remains as it was determined in the previous iteration based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - `j` is now 2.

Thus, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is either equal to `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `j` is 2**
