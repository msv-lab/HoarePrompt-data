Output State: **`total` is now `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers, `best` is the minimum value between `best` (initially 1000000000) and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Since `v` is -1, the specific value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is used in the calculation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
