Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is False, `j` is the previous value of `j` + 1. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
