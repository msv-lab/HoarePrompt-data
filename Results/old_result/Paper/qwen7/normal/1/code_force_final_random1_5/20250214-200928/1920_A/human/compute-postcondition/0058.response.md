Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, and `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` is 3.**

In this final state, the variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs `n` times. The variable `start` will hold the smallest value of `v` where `t` is 1, as it updates `start` whenever a smaller value is encountered. Similarly, `end` will hold the largest value of `v` where `t` is 2, updating itself whenever a larger value is found. Lastly, `num` will be a list of all `v` values where `t` is 3, preserving the order in which they were input.
