Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. If `cur` does not have the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set, then `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`, and `ans` is updated accordingly.
