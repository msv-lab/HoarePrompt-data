Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string created by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `_` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr` to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states.
