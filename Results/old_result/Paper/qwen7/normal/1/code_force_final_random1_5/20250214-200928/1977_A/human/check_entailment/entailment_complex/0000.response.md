Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading pairs of integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is equal to `m`. If true, it prints "Yes".
   - If `m` is greater than `n`, it prints "No".
   - If `m` is `n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
   - If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
   - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is equal to `m`, the program correctly prints "Yes".
   - When `m` is greater than `n`, the program correctly prints "No".
   - When `m` is `n - 1`, the program correctly prints "Yes".
   - When both `m` and `n` are even, the program correctly prints "Yes" because adding or removing an even number of cubes can result in the same parity (even).
   - When both `m` and `n` are odd, the program correctly prints "Yes" because adding or removing an odd number of cubes can result in the same parity (odd).

4. **Logic**:
   - The logic correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
