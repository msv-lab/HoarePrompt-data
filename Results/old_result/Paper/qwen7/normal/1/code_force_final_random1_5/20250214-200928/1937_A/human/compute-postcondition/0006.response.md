Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 1; `power` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `power` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n_cases` or `n`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `n_cases` and `n` remain unchanged, and only `power` is set to 1.
