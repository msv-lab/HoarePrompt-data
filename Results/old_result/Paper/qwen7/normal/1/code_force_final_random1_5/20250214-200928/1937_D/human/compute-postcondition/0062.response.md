Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `2 * [i]`, `x` is `2 * (n - 4)**

Explanation: Initially, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, and `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Since `B` initially contains one element `x`, `B[len(B) - 1]` is `x`, `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` is `i`, and `len(idx_B)` is 1. Therefore, `x` is updated to `x + (i - i) * 1`, which simplifies to `x`. Given that `x` was initially defined as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and since `B` only had one element `x`, `x` remains unchanged. Thus, `x` is effectively `2 * [i]`, which is `2 * (n - 4)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
