Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `pos_final` is now `pos_final` - 1, `c` is 2, `v` is -1 minus the length of `custo_pra_frente`, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `na_frente` and `c` retain their original values, `v` remains as `-1 - len(custo_pra_frente)`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` stays as a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
