Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `y` is an integer input from the second split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict with default value as list.**

The code initializes a defaultdict named `lst` where the default value for any key is a list. This does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, or the list of starting nodes. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
