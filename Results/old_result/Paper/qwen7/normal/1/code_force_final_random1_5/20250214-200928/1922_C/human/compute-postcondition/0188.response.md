Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer, and the current value of `y` is greater than `x`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

Here, `d1` is a dictionary (though it is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we need to assume it exists and contains keys corresponding to `x` and `y`). Since `y` is greater than `x`, `d1[y]` will be the value associated with the key `y` in the dictionary `d1`, and `d1[x]` will be the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `d1`.

The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` calculates the difference between these two values.

Given that the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their keys.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
