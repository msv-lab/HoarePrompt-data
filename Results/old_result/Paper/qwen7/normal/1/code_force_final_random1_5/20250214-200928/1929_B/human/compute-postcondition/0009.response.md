Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer.
   - The condition for the postcondition is `4 * n - 2 == k`.

2. **Understand the loop:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, where `t` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer.
   - The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not change within the loop.

3. **Determine the states to be adjusted:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `t`.
   - The loop will execute `t` times, and each iteration does not change the values of `n` or `k`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop does not modify `n` or `k`, these values remain the same.
   - The loop counter `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration.

5. **Calculate the new state:**
   - After one iteration, `t` is reduced by 1.
   - The postcondition `4 * n - 2 == k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` is still the integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer.
- `k` is still the integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer.
- `t` is reduced by 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `t` is reduced by 1**
