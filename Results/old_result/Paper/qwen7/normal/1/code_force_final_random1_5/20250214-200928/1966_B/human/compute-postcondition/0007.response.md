Output State: **`tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split, `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the input string and the second element is the new input string, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The code appends a new input string to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains one element, which is an input string. After appending another input string using `input()`, `gr` now contains two elements: the original input string and the newly entered string. All other variables (`tc`, `n`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
