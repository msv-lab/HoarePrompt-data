Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If `visited[i]` is False, then `ok` is True, `bipartite` is True, and `tot` is 0.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The conditions involving `visited[i]`, `ok`, `bipartite`, and `tot` are not directly affected by the loop itself but rather by the loop body, which is omitted here. Therefore, these conditions remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless modified within the loop body.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0 (since it was true before and no information suggests it changed).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
