Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignment for `b`.
