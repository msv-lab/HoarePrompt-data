Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It checks if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` based on the direction of arrows in the grid.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not fully account for all possible paths the robot can take. Specifically, it only checks certain conditions and returns 'No' without considering other possible valid paths.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, and calls `func_1` to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.
   - The output is formatted correctly, but the correctness of the output depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Logic Flaws**:
  - The function checks specific conditions for the middle part of the grid (`2 * i + 1` and `2 * i` indices), but it does not handle the entire grid correctly.
  - It assumes that if an arrow points left at an odd index, the robot cannot reach the end, which is overly restrictive and does not cover all possible valid paths.
  - It does not consider the possibility of the robot moving up and down between rows.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the movement of the robot through the grid while respecting the directions of the arrows. We should check if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` by simulating its path.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_target(n, row1, row2):
    x, y = 1, 1  # Start at (1, 1)
    while True:
        if x == 2 and y == n:
            return True
        if x == 1 and y < n and row1[y] == '>':
            y += 1
        elif x == 1 and y > 1 and row1[y-1] == '<':
            y -= 1
        elif x == 2 and y < n and row2[y] == '>':
            y += 1
        elif x == 2 and y > 1 and row2[y-1] == '<':
            y -= 1
        else:
            break
        if x == 1:
            x = 2
        else:
            x = 1
    return False

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append('Yes' if can_reach_target(n, row1, row2) else 'No')
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not fully simulate the robot's movement and does not handle all possible paths. The corrected program above properly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

**Correctness: **False**
