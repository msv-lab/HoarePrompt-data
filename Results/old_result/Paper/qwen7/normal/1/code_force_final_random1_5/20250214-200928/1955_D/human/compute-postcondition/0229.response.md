Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is (n - m) + 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is increased by 1 for the index `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be in the range `0` to `m-1`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` by 1. The value of `i` is `(n - m) + 1`, and since `b_values` remains unchanged, the only change is in `cnt_b[b[i]]`. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
