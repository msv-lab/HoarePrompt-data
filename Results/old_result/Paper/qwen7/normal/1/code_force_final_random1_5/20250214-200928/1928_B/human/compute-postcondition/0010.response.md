Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 3`, `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 3]`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `tem` and the second element is also `tem`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(tem)` appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element which is `tem`. After appending `tem` again, `ans` now contains two elements, both of which are equal to `tem`. The values of `i` and `tem` remain unchanged from their initial states.
