Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `nx` is the string `xx[i][j - 1]` concatenated with the previous value of `nx`, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Since `j` is 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` refers to `xx[i][0]`. The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating this value to the existing string `nx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
