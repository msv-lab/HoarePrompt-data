Output State: **`i` is the total sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1's in `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l` for each prefix sum, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and we take two integers as input using `map(int, input().split())`.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `i`, `j`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
