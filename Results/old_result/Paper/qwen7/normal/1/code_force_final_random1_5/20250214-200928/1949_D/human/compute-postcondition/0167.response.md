Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `nx` is determined as follows: if the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is not '?', then `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j-1]`. Otherwise, if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.
