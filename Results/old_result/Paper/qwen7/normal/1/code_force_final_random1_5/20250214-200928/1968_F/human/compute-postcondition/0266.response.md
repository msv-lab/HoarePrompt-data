Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 11`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is reassigned to `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted (previously calculated), `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is `['YES']` if `x == 0`, otherwise `['NO']`.**

Explanation: The code updates `it2` to be the value of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. This does not affect any other variables. The value of `results` remains unchanged unless `x == 0`, in which case it would be `['YES']`. Since no specific condition is given that `x == 0`, we assume the general case where `results` could be either `['YES']` or `['NO']` depending on the value of `x`.
