#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()

    #State: final is either [0] or an empty list, and remains sorted.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of cases), an integer `n` (length of binary string), and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates the percentage of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string. If at any point both percentages reach 50%, it records the position. After identifying all such positions, it selects the one closest to half the length of the string (`pk`). If no such position exists, it returns either the start or end of the string based on the majority count of '0's or '1's. Finally, it prints the selected position.
