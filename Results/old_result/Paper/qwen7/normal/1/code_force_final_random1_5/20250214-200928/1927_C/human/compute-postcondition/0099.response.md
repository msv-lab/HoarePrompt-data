Postcondition: `aOnes` is either 1 or 0, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is not present in both lists `a` and `b`, and either `i` is in list `a` and `aOnes` does not exceed `newk`, or `i` is in list `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, or `i` is not in list `b` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`.
