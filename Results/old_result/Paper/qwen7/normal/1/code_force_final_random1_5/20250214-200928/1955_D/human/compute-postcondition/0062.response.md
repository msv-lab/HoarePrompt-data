Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is initialized. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, it is further decremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans`.
