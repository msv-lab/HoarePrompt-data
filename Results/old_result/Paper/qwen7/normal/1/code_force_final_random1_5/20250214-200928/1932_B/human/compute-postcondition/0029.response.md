Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `year` is the minimum value found among all elements in the list `a`, and `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial conditions for `n`, `t`, and `year` remain unchanged.
