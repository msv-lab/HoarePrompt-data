Output State: `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `numbers` is an empty list, `distribute_number(num)` has been called with each argument `num` from the original `numbers` list exactly once.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `numbers` will be an empty list because each number was processed exactly once. The functions `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` remain at 0 as there is no indication in the provided information that these variables are being modified within the `distribute_number(num)` function.
