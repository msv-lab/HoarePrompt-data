Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is 4, `l` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and `idx_B` contains all the indices `i` where `s[i] == '<'**.

The variable `l` is assigned the value 0, which was not previously defined. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged from their initial states.
