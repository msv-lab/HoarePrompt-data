Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0
   - `smin` is updated based on the condition: if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is appended with `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` has its last element appended with `smin[i]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is derived from the list `b` and does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `smin` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is now 1).

4. **New State:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same as the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `smin` will be updated according to the condition with `i` being 1.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0, `smin` is updated such that if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is appended with `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` has its last element appended with `smin[i]`**.
