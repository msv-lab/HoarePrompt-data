Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 (This information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop variables but is part of the context)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 1
   - `m` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged)
   - `cnt_b[b[i]]` is not directly affected by the loop head, so its state remains as it was before the loop started.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0**
