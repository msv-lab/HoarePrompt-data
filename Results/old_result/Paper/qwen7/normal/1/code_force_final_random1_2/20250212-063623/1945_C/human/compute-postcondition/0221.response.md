Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 20; `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20]; `final` is [5]; `pk` is `mini` + elem; `elem` is 5.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `elem` (which is 5) to the list `final`. The value of `mini` remains the same as it was the minimum value between its current value and 10. The value of `ele` and `lst` remain unchanged. Since `final` now contains the element 5, it is represented as `[5]`. The value of `pk` is calculated as the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem`, which is equal to `mini`. Given that `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10, and `elem` is 5, the value of `pk` would be `mini + 5`.
