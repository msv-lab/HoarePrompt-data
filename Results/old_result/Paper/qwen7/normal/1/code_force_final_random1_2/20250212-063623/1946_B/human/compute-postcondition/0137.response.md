Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `suf` is a list with its first two elements being `suf[0] + b[0]` and `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1]`**.

Explanation: The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends a new element to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `suf[i]` refers to the second element of `suf`, which is `suf[0] + b[0]` (since `suf[0]` is `suf[0] + b[0]`). Adding `l[i]` (which is `b[1]`) to `suf[0] + b[0]` gives `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1]`. Therefore, the updated list `suf` now has two elements: `suf[0] + b[0]` and `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
