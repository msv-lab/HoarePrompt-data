Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 0, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, and either `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True` and `el` is equal to '.Q', or `el` is the third element of the `command` list which is '.', `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is 10, or `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index specified by `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element, if `obj` is a black piece ('.B'), `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `player` is set to the piece at `nxt` if `nxt` is occupied by another player's piece, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` if `com` is 'T', `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if the current position (`pos`) is in a goal area, otherwise the state remains unchanged.**
