Output State: **`total` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The variable `best` is assigned the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `v` is updated to `v - 1`, and the condition that `v` must be greater than `-1` is still valid.
