Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The grid is composed of cells containing either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, identified by a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function evaluates the grid and returns a specific output based on predefined conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own grid of specified dimensions and content ('W' or 'B'). It processes these grids according to certain rules (not detailed here) and returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.
