Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2 * q + 2, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', an empty string is appended to `results`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0, `mp` is a dictionary with key 0 and value [0]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` is a list containing `[2]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3; `idx` is 4; `a` is a list with an element at index 3 equal to 4; `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ 4`; if `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` becomes an empty list; `mp[pf[3]]` contains the value 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `idx` is 5, `a` is a list with an element at index 4 equal to 4, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ 4`, if `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` becomes an empty list and `mp[pf[3]]` contains the value 3, `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ 4`, and if `pf[4]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[4]]` becomes an empty list, `mp[pf[4]].append(4)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
