Functionality: **The function processes a series of times in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format, printing whether the time is AM or PM. It does not return any value but prints the converted times. The function iterates over the number of test cases specified by the user, converting each time and printing the result. If the hour part of the time is '00', it prints '12' instead. For hours 01 to 12, it prints the hour as is. For hours 13 to 23, it prints the hour minus 12 with a leading zero.**
