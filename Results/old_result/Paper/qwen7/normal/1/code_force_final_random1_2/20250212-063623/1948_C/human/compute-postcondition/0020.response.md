Output State: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i` (which increments by 2 each time) is less than `n`. After all iterations, if the loop does not encounter any `break` statements due to the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` being true for any `i`, it will print 'yes'. If the condition is true for any `i` during any iteration, the loop will break and print 'No'. Therefore, the final output state is determined by whether the loop breaks or completes all its iterations without breaking.

In simpler terms, if the loop completes all its iterations without finding any instance where `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true, the output will be 'yes'. Otherwise, the output will be 'No'.
