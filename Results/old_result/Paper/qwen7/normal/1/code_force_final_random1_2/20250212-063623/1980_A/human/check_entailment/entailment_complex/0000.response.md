Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input data and processes each test case individually.
2. It initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the given string `a`.
3. For each test case, it calculates the number of missing problems required to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level by using the formula `sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)`.
4. The logic to calculate the missing problems is correct because it ensures that for each difficulty level, if the current count (`f`) is less than `m`, the difference (`m - f`) is added to the `missing` count.
5. The program correctly returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
