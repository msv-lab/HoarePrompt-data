Output State: **`balance` is decreased by 1, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being an unspecified value, `i` being 0, and `s[i]` being the first character of `s`, and `s[i]` is not an opening parenthesis `(`.**

The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
