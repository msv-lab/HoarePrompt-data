You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; processing is a list of length equal to the maximum key in d, containing only 0s and 1s indicating whether a node has been processed; da is an integer representing a key in the dictionary d; rank is a list of integers with the same length as the maximum key in d, initialized to 0s.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: Postcondition: `tmp` is 1000000000, `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of length equal to the maximum key in `d`, containing only 0s and 1s indicating whether a node has been processed, `da` is an integer representing a key in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d`, initialized to 0s, and the length of `d[da]` is not equal to 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: All elements in `processing` are set to 1, `tmp` is set to the minimum value obtained from calling `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`, and the values of `da`, `rank`, and `d` remain unchanged.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a processing list, an integer `da`, and a rank list. It returns either 1 or the value of `rank[da - 1]` which is `tmp + 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
