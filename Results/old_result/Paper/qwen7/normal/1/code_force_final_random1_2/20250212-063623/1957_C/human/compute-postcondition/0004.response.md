Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp[1]` is 1
   - `dp[2]` is 3
   - `dp[3]` is 5
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n
   - `i` is 4

3. **Determine the Next State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4.

4. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i in range(3, n + 1)`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 5.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 5**
