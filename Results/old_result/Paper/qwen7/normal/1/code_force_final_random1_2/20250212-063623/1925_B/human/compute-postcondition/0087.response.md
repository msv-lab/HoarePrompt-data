Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i` if there exists an integer `i` (\(1 \leq i \leq x\)) such that `x % i == 0` and the condition `(x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is true. If no such `i` exists or the condition is false, `ans` remains unchanged.
