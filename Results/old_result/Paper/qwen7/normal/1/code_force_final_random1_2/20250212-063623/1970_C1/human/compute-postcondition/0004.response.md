Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to variables `a` and `b`. The precondition that `x` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
