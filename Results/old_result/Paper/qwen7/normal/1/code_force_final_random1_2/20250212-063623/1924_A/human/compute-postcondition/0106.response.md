Postcondition: **Output State: The input string `s` has been fully processed, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively. The variable `cur_ss` represents the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and it resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\).**
