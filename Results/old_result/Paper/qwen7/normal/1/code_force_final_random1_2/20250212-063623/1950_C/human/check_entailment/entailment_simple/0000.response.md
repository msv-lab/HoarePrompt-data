Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. For each test case, it extracts the hour part `h` from the input string `s`.
3. It then determines whether the time is in the AM or PM period based on the value of `h`:
   - If `h` is '00', it prints '12' followed by the minutes, indicating midnight in the 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is, followed by the minutes.
   - If `h` is between '13' and '23', it calculates the equivalent hour in the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from `h` and adds a leading zero if necessary, followed by the minutes.
4. The function correctly handles all edge cases, including the transition from 12 PM to 1 AM and the special case of '00' representing midnight.
5. The function prints the result in the correct format, with the hour and minutes separated by a colon and followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
