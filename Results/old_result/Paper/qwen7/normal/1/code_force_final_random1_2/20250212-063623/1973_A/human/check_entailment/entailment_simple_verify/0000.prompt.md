You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and cas_de_test is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three integers [p_1, p_2, p_3] representing the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30).

    #State: Output State: The `resultats` list will contain the results of all the valid cases processed by the loop. For each valid case, the value appended to `resultats` will be `egalites // 2`, where `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If any case does not meet the conditions specified in the loop (i.e., `total_points` is odd, `total_matchs` is greater than 3, or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`), then `-1` will be appended to `resultats` instead.
    #
    #In summary, `resultats` will be a list of all valid `egalites // 2` values for each set of `[p1, p2, p3]` in `cas_de_test`, with `-1` appended wherever the conditions are not met.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list `resultats` containing the valid `egalites // 2` values for each set of `[p1, p2, p3]` in `cas_de_test`, with `-1` appended wherever the conditions are not met.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the scores are (1, 1, 2) correctly. According to the problem description, the scores (1, 1, 2) are achievable through two games: one win-lose game and one draw game. However, the program incorrectly returns -1 for this case. 

To verify this, let's manually check the logic:

- For scores (1, 1, 2):
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\)
  - Total matches: \(4 / 2 = 2\)
  - Since \(p_3 = 2\) and \(p_2 = 1\), the difference in points is \(2 - 1 = 1\).
  - The number of wins/losses is \(2 \times 1 = 2\).
  - The remaining points are \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\), which should be distributed as draws.
  - Therefore, the number of draws should be \(2 / 2 = 1\).

However, the program incorrectly returns -1 for this case. Thus, the program is incorrect.
