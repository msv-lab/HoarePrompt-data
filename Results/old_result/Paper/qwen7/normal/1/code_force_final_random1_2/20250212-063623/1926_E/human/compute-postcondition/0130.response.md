Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within specific ranges (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. It returns a result based on the relationship between `n`, `k`, and `t`.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `n`, `k`, and `t` through some mechanism (not shown in the provided code snippet), where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it checks the relationship between `n` and `k` and returns a result accordingly.
