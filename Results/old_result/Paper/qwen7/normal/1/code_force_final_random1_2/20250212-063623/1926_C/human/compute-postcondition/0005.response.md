Output State: **`a` is `2 * num % 10`, `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 20000\)**.

Explanation: Initially, `a` is set to `num % 10`. After executing `a = a + num % 10`, `a` is updated to `num % 10 + num % 10`, which simplifies to `2 * num % 10`. The value of `num` remains unchanged within the given range.
