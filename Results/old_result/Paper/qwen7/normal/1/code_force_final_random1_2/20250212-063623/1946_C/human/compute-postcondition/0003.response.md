Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) after calling the function `solve()`**

The function `solve()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `solve()` is provided, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The precondition that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) is still valid after the call to `solve()`.
