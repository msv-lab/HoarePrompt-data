Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 3, 2], `tot` is `tot` + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `tot` is incremented by the value of `a`, which is 1. The initial condition for `tot` is that it is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus 1. After incrementing `tot` by 1, the new value of `tot` is the original value of `tot` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
