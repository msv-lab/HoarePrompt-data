Output State: **`i` is 4; `array2` is `[arr[3] - arr[2] * a]`; `n` must still be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Given that `i` was initially 3, after the operation `i` becomes 4. The value appended to `array2` is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
