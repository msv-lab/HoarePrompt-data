Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`**.

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
