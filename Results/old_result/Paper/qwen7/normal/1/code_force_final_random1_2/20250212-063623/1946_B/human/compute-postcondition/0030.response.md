Output State: **`i` is 2, `smin` is a list where the second element is the minimum value between `suf[1]` and `smin[1]`, and `smin` is appended with `suf[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is 2, `suf[i + 1]` corresponds to `suf[3]`. The initial state of `smin` is such that its second element is the minimum value between `suf[1]` and `smin[0]`. This information remains valid, and now `smin` also contains the value of `suf[3]` as its last element.
