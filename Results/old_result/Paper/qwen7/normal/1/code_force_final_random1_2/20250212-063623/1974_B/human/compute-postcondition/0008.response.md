Output State: **`i` is 1; `j` is len(unique_chars) - 1; `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index 0.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The values of `j` and the operation of inserting `char` into `unique_chars` at index `i` remain unchanged.
