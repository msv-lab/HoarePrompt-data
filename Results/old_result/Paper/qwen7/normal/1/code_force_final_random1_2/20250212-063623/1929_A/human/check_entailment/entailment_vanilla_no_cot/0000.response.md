Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the solution only finds the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for `i` from `2` to `n`.

To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest element at `a_1` and the smallest at `a_n`, and then sort the rest of the elements in ascending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        # Place the largest element at the start and the smallest at the end
        max_beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i+1] for i in range(n-1))
        print(max_beauty)

func()
```

This solution sorts the array and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which correctly gives the maximum beauty of the array.
