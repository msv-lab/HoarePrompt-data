Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the current state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the state also remains unchanged. If `A` is odd, `i` is 0, `A` is the first input integer divided by 2, `B` is the second input integer, and `C` is the third input integer with `B * 2` being greater than or equal to `C`.
