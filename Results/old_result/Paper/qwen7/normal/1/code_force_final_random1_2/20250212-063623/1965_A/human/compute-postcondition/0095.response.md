Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the function does not make any additional changes to `test`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, with `j` being equal to the length of `lis`, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and the value of `test` remains False. Additionally, if the length of `lis` is odd or even, no specific changes are made.**
