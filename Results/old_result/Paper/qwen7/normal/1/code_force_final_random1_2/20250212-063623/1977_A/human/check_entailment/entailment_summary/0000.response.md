Reasoning:
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the execution summary.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Conditions Check**:
   - If `n == m`, it means that the number of moves equals the number of cubes, which is feasible since he can add one cube per move. Hence, the output should be "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, it is impossible to have more cubes than moves, so the output should be "No".
   - If `m == n - 1`, it implies that he removed exactly one cube at the start and added the rest, which is also feasible. Hence, the output should be "Yes".
   - If both `m` and `n` are even, it suggests that the operations (additions and removals) balance out to an even number of moves, making it possible to achieve `m` cubes. Hence, the output should be "Yes".
   - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it suggests that the operations balance out to an odd number of moves, making it possible to achieve `m` cubes. Hence, the output should be "Yes".
   - Otherwise, the output should be "No".

Given the above analysis, the conditions in the program seem to cover all the necessary cases correctly. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the last test case. According to the execution summary, the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their values from the last test case, which might lead to incorrect outputs for subsequent test cases if the function is called multiple times without resetting these variables.

To ensure correctness, the function should reset these variables after processing each test case. However, based on the logic provided and the conditions checked, the logic itself appears to be correct for individual test cases.

Correctness: **True**
