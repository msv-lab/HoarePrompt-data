Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n, 2):`. The objects involved here are `i`, `n`, and the step value `2`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` starts from 1.
   - The step value is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - The step value `2` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the given initial state**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer (this is already part of the loop head, so no change needed).
   - `b` is a string input by the user (not relevant to the loop).

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
