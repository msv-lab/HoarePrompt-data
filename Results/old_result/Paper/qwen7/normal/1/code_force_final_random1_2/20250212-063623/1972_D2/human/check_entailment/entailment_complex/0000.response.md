Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The provided code consists of two functions:
  - `func_1()` calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
  - `func_2()` processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

- Let's analyze `func_1()`:
  - It correctly reads \(n\) and \(m\) from input.
  - It uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \leq \sqrt{n}\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
  - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and updates the count `cnt` accordingly.
  - The logic for updating `cnt` seems to be correct based on the problem statement.

- Now, let's analyze `func_2()`:
  - It correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
  - It processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
  - The state of `t` is maintained correctly, ensuring it decreases with each call to `func_1()` until all test cases are processed.

- Given the problem constraints and the provided example outputs, the functions seem to be implementing the solution correctly.

- The provided comments and the example outputs also support the correctness of the implementation.

Based on the analysis, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
