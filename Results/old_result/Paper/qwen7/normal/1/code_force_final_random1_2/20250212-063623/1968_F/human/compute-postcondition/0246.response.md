Postcondition: **`idx` is now 2 * n + 5, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1, if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` is `['YES']`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO']`, and `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1.**
