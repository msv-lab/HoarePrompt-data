The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a string `row1`, and a string `row2`. It then calls another function `func_1` for each test case, passing `n`, `row1`, and `row2` as arguments. The results from `func_1` for each test case are stored in a list. Finally, it prints the results from `func_1` for all test cases, each on a new line.
