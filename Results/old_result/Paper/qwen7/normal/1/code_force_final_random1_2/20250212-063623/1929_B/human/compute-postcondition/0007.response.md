Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- The condition `4 * n - 2 != k` holds true.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(ceil(k / 2))`.

From the condition `4 * n - 2 != k`, we know that `k` cannot be equal to `4 * n - 2`. However, this does not give us the exact value of `k`, only that it must satisfy this inequality.

The `ceil(k / 2)` function will take the value of `k`, divide it by 2, and then round up to the nearest integer if there is any remainder.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, we can describe the result in terms of `k`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) rounds up k / 2 to the nearest integer)**
