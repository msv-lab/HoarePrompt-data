Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`; `pos` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. The other variables (`rest`, `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The condition `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)` is still valid.
