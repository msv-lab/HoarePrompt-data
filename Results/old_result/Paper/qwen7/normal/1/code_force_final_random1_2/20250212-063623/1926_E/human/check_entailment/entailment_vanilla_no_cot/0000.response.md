Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func()` correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card that Vladislav lays down according to the specified rules. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Calculating the Order of Cards**: For each test case, it calculates how many cards are laid down at each step (odd numbers, then 2 times odd numbers, 3 times odd numbers, etc.). This is done using the loop where `m = (n + 1) // 2` and `n -= m`.
3. **Determining the k-th Card**: After calculating the order, it determines which type of card (odd, 2 times odd, 3 times odd, etc.) the k-th card belongs to and computes its exact value.
4. **Output**: It prints the k-th card for each test case.

The logic is sound and matches the problem description accurately. Therefore, the function is correct.
