Postcondition: `y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, `custo` is increased by either `a_values[0] + b_values[max_p - 2]` if `y == 1`, or it remains increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]` if `y != 1`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]` and `a_values[0]` is only considered if `y` equals 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
