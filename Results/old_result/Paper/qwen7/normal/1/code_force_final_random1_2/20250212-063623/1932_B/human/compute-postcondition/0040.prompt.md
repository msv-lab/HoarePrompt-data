Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    year = 0
    for ai in a:
        year += year % ai or ai
    print(year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `year` is the sum of the smallest elements in the original list `a` for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will be empty since one element is processed in each iteration. The variable `year` accumulates the value of the smallest element from `a` in each iteration. Therefore, `year` will be the sum of the smallest elements from the original list `a` for each of its iterations through the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `year` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The value of `year` will be the result of iteratively applying the operation `year += year % ai or ai` for each element `ai` in the list `a`. This means that `year` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `year` and the current element from the list `a`.

In more detail, starting from the initial value of `year` (which is 0), the loop will go through each integer in the list `a` and update `year` as follows:
- For the first element `a[0]`, `year` becomes `year + (year % a[0] or a[0])`.
- For the second element `a[1]`, `year` becomes `(year + (year % a[0] or a[0])) + ((year + (year % a[0] or a[0])) % a[1] or a[1])`.
- This process continues for each subsequent element in the list `a`, updating `year` according to the same rule.

The final value of `year` will be the sum of all such updates, reflecting the cumulative effect of the operation applied to each element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
