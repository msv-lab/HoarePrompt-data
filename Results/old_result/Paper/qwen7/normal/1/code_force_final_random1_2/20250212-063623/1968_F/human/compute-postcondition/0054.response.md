Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is now either an empty list or a list containing 'YES', `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `it2` using the `bisect.bisect_left` function. This function returns the index of the leftmost place in the sorted list `v2` where `r` can be inserted without violating the order. The `-1` adjustment is made to get the index of the element just before `r`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
