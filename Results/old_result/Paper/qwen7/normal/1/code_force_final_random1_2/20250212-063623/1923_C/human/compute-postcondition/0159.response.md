Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[b] - p[a - 1]` does not change the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `s`. It only reassigns the value of `s` based on the current values of `p[b]` and `p[a - 1]`. Since `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from the input, their previous values are no longer relevant. All other variables retain their previous states.
