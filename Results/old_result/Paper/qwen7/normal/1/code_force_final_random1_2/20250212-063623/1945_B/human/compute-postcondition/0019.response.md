Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from input, `b` is the second integer from input, `m` is the third integer from input, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mn` to the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the next set of integers from input, `mn` is now calculated as the minimum of these two new values plus `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
