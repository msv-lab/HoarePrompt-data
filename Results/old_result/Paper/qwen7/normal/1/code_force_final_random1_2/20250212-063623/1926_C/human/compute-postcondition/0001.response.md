Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num != 0`.
2. **Current state**: Before the loop, `a` is 0, and `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `num != 0` must be true. Since `num` is already stated to be a positive integer (which means `num > 0`), it inherently satisfies the condition `num != 0`.

Given this, no adjustments are needed for the state of `num` to make the loop execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains the same.

**State: **`a` is 0, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5**
