Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `l` is a map object of integers split from the input.
   - `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Ensure other states remain consistent**:
   - `n` is not directly involved in the loop, so its state remains unchanged.
   - `l` and `lis` are not directly modified by the loop, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `t`.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`**.
