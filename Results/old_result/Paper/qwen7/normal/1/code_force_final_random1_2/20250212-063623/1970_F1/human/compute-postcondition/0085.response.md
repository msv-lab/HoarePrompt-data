Output State: **`i` is now `elements[line[ind + 1]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, and `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is evaluated as follows: if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `False`, then `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuples `(i, ind + 1)` and `(i, ind)`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `elements[line[ind]] = i, ind` updates the dictionary `elements` with the key `line[ind]` and assigns the tuple `(i, ind)` to it.
- The variable `i` is either `elements[line[ind + 1]]` or `elements['G']` from the initial state.
- The variable `ind` is incremented by 1.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is an odd positive integer within the specified range.
- The variable `line` remains unchanged as it is a non-empty list of strings.
- The function `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` remains as described in the initial state, with its behavior depending on the value of `line[ind + 1]`.
