Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `a`, `ans` is the count of consecutive pairs in `a` that differ by 2 or an even number where `y` was sufficient to decrement, `tmp` contains the integer division of the differences by 2 for those pairs where the difference was even and `y` allowed it, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, and the condition `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` is true.
