Output State: `j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` remains `False` if the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have reached `m-1` (since the loop runs `m-1` times). The condition inside the loop does not change the value of `impossible` unless one of the specified conditions (elements not being equal) is met during any iteration. Given that the problem statement mentions the initial condition where the first element of the first row and the last element of the last row are not equal to their respective next elements, `impossible` remains `False` throughout the loop iterations.
