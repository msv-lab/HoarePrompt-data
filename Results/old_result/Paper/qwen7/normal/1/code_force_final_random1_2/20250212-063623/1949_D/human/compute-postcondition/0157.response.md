Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer, `nx` is the string 'xx[1][0]', `j` is 1, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', so `nx` becomes the string `xx[1][0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
