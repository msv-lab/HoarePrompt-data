Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, a = test_cases[_]
    freq = [0] * 7
    for prob in a:
        freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
    missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)
    results.append(missing)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `freq` is a list where each index corresponds to the frequency of each letter from A to G based on the list `a`; `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`; `results` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `missing`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `freq` is a list of 7 elements representing the count of characters from 'A' to 'G', `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`, `results` is a list with three elements, the first two are equal to the final value of `missing`, and the third element is also equal to the final value of `missing`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `freq` are incremented by the count of their corresponding character in `a`. The value of `missing` is updated based on the final state of `freq`. The list `results` contains three elements, each equal to the final value of `missing`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
