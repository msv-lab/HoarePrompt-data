Reasoning:
- The main function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1()` with the appropriate parameters for each test case.
- The function `func_1()` is designed to determine if it's possible to defeat all monsters given the constraints. It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player, ensuring that the closest monsters are dealt with first. It then uses the available bullets to reduce the health of the monsters, moving them closer after each second.
- The logic within `func_1()` ensures that:
  - Monsters are processed in order of their proximity to the player.
  - Bullets are used optimally to reduce the health of the closest monsters first.
  - The function returns `True` if all monsters can be defeated before any of them reach the player, and `False` otherwise.
- Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, both functions (`func_1()` and `func_2()`) correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
