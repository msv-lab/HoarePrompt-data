Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly calculates the year in which all \( n \) signs will occur according to the rules specified in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \). For each test case, it reads the number of signs \( n \) and the periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).

2. **Year Calculation**: For each test case, the program initializes `year` to 0. It then iterates over each periodicity \( a_i \):
   - For each \( a_i \), it updates `year` to the next multiple of \( a_i \) that is greater than or equal to the current `year`. This is achieved using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`, which ensures that `year` is incremented to the next multiple of \( a_i \).

3. **Output**: After processing all periodicities, the program prints the final value of `year`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly computes the year when all signs will occur sequentially, as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
