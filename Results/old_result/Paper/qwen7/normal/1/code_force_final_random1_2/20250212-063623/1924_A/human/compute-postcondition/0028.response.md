Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and `ans` is `ans + ss`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the string `ss` to the end of the current value of `ans`. Since the initial state of `ans` is `ss`, after executing the code, `ans` becomes `ans + ss`. The values of `cur`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
