Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case includes the variable `elem` and the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `mini` is defined as the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
   - `final` is an empty list.

3. **Understand what the loop does**: The loop iterates over each element `elem` in `lst`. Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know exactly what happens inside the loop, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the given initial state.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. If `lst` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `elem` will take on the values from `lst` during each iteration, starting from the first element.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `lst` must have at least one element.
- `elem` will start as the first element of `lst`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `lst` must have at least one element, and `elem` is the first element of `lst`**.
