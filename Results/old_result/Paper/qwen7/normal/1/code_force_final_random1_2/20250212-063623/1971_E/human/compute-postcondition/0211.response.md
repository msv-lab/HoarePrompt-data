Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `l` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` calculates the index `s` where the value `ql` (which is the integer input) should be inserted into the list `a` to maintain the list's sorted order. However, since the list `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
