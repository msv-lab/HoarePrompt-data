Output State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`**.

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with an integer factory function. This means that `d1` is now a dictionary-like object where any key that does not exist will automatically be assigned a default value of `0`. None of the existing variables (`j`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `l`) are affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.
