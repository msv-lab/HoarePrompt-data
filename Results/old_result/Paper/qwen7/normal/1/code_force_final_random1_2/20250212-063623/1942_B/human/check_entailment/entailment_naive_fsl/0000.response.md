Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic used to compute the MEX value and assign values to the permutation \( p \) is flawed.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Case
- **Test Case Input:**
  ```
  1
  5
  1 1 -2 1 2
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  A valid permutation \( p \) that satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

- **Program Output:**
  The program attempts to compute the MEX value in reverse order but fails to correctly update the MEX value as it should. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

  1. **Initialization:**
     - `mex = n` (where `n = 5`), so `mex = 5`.

  2. **Backward Iteration:**
     - For \( i = 4 \): 
       - `res[4] = mex - ar[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`.
       - Update `mex = mex - ar[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`.
     - For \( i = 3 \):
       - `res[3] = mex - ar[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`.
       - Update `mex = mex - ar[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`.
     - For \( i = 2 \):
       - `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`.
       - Update `mex = mex - ar[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`.
     - For \( i = 1 \):
       - `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`.
       - Update `mex = mex - ar[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`.
     - For \( i = 0 \):
       - `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`.
       - Update `mex = mex - ar[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`.

  - The resulting permutation \( p \) would be `[2, 3, 4, 3, 2]`, which is not a valid permutation since the values are not unique.

This example shows that the program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
