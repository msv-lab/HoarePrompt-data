Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `best` is `n-1` if `res` is equal to '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, the value of `best` remains 0.

Since the value of `res` is not specified, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `res` is equal to '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, then `best` will be `n-1`.
2. Otherwise, `best` will be 0.

However, since the problem does not specify the value of `res`, we should consider the general case where `best` could be either `n-1` or 0. But typically, without additional context, we assume the most straightforward scenario where `res` is '<' for simplicity unless otherwise stated.

Given this, let's assume `res` is '<' for each iteration, making `best` equal to `n-1`.

Now, we need to determine the value of `k`. Since `k` is not defined in the initial state, it must be a variable that is set somewhere in the code before the print statement. Without further information, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **! [k] [n-1]** (where `[k]` is the value of `k` and `[n-1]` is the value of `best`).
