Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is True, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(arr) - 1` assigns the length of the list `arr` minus one to the variable `n`. The other variables (`tc`, `arr`, `dp`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `n` is now updated to the length of `arr` minus one, while `tc`, `arr`, `dp`, and `i` retain their original values.
