Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed for each iteration, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found for each iteration, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found for each iteration, `z` is the substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if `x` is not -1 and `n - y - 1` is within the bounds of `arr`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged for each iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as an input integer `t` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. For each of the `t` inputs, the variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be set based on the specific input for that iteration. The final state will reflect the processing of all `t` inputs through the loop, with `t` being 0 and all other variables reflecting their last computed values from the respective iterations.
