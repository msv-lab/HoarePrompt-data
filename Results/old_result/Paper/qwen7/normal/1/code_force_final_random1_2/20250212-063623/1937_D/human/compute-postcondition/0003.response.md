Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.

3. **Understand the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `i` should be 0 and `n` should be greater than 0.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
