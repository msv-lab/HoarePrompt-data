Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`**.

Explanation: The code `x = s.count('map')` counts the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. The values of `a` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states, and a new variable `x` is introduced, holding the count of 'map' in `s`.
