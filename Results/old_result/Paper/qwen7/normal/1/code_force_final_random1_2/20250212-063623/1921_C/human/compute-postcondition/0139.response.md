Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the original length of `arr`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `array2` is a list. Depending on the condition, for each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, if `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` will include `arr[0] * a`. For any other index `i` where `0 < i < n`, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` will include `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If neither condition is met for any iteration, `array2` will remain unchanged from its initial state. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the first condition is met. Otherwise, the second condition is met.**
