Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `j` and `n`**:
   - The initial state of `i` is given as `previous_i + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`.
   - The variable `nx` is an empty string, but this does not affect the loop execution.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j` iterating from 1 to `n + 1`, the initial value of `j` should be 1.
   - The variable `n` must be a positive integer such that the loop can execute (i.e., `n` must be at least 1).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
