    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` (which is assigned the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`) is not equal to `-1`. Each iteration appends the current value of `n` to `path_ba`. This process repeats until `n` becomes `-1`, indicating that we have reached the end of the path starting from `b`. At this point, the loop breaks, and `path_ba` contains the shortest path from `b` to the node that has no parent in the `previous` array, which is represented by `-1`.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `ops` is a list containing six tuples: (c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (c, 4), (c, 5), and (c, 6); `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is at least 3, `i` is 7.
        #
        #This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ops` will contain tuples where the first element is always `c` and the second element ranges from 0 to 6, incrementing by 2 starting from 0 up to the maximum value of `ci`, which is at least 3. The other variables (`d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`) remain unchanged from their state after the third iteration, as they are not affected by the loop's body or head.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `ops` is a list containing twelve tuples: (`c1`, `i + 4`), (`c2`, `i + 4`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i`), and (`c2`, `i + 4`).
        #
        #In this final state, `ops` will contain all the appended tuples from the loop executions. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of `2`. Given that the loop has executed three times as per the provided information, we can infer that the loop would continue to append tuples until it reaches the end of its range. Since the loop increments `i` by `2` each time and the loop runs three times, `i` would have been incremented to `i + 6` by the end of the loop. However, the tuples are appended based on the current value of `i` at each iteration, leading to the described set of tuples in `ops`. The other variables such as `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    #State: `ops` is a list of tuples. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains six tuples: (c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (c, 4), (c, 5), and (c, 6). If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains twelve tuples: (`c1`, `i + 4`), (`c2`, `i + 4`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i`), and (`c2`, `i + 4`). The other variables (`d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`) remain unchanged from their state after the third iteration.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: 12
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: - Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we provide the output for both cases.
    #
    #Output:
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input tree structure and computes a specific sequence of operations based on a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal. It first constructs the tree from user input, then performs BFS twice to find a specific node and its predecessor path. Depending on the length of the path, it generates a list of operations (tuples) and prints the count and details of these operations. The function ultimately returns nothing (None).
