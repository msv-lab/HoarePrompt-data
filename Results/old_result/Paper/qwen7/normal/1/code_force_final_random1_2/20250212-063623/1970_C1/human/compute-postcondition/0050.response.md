Postcondition: `queue` is not empty. If `current` (which was the first element of `queue` before calling `popleft`) is equal to `target`, the function returns the second element of the list `queue` (which was initially `dist` before calling `popleft`). If `current` is not equal to `target`, the function does not return anything as there is no else part in the code.
