Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < k`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `i` is 0
   - `k` is a positive integer (though its specific value is not provided, it is known to be positive)

4. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **Adjusting the State**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The value of `k` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer**
