Output State: `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 20; `lst` is [15, 20]; `final` is [5, 10, 15, 20]; `pk` is `mini` + 15; `elem` is 15.

Explanation: After the loop completes all iterations, `lst` will be modified to exclude the elements that were appended to `final`. The original `lst` was [5, 10, 15, 20]. During the loop, elements 5, 10, and 15 from `lst` were added to `final`. Therefore, `lst` is left with [15, 20]. The loop iterates over each element in `lst`, and since `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10, it remains as 10 throughout the iterations. The variable `pk` is updated to `mini + elem` for each iteration where the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is met. In this case, `pk` becomes `mini + 15` when `elem` is 15. The variable `ele` remains 20 as it is not used within the loop. The variable `final` contains all the elements that met the condition, which are [5, 10, 15, 20].
