Output State: **`m` is updated to be the second integer entered through input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers entered through input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `n` is the first integer entered through input, `l` is a list of integers split from the input, `p` is now `[0]`, `c` is now `[0]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `c` with a single element `[0]`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `n`, `l`, or `p`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged except for `p` and `c`, which are now `[0]`.
