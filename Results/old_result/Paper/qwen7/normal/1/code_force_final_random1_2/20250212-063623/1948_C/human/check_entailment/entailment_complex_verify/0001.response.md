### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not cover all necessary conditions for determining if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. Let's break down why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function only checks specific pairs of columns and the last column, but it fails to account for the entire grid configuration.
   - For example, consider the grid `>>><` (first row) and `>><<` (second row). The function would incorrectly conclude that the robot can reach `(2, 4)` because it does not check the entire grid properly.
   - Similarly, for the grid `>><<><` (first row) and `><>>><` (second row), the function might incorrectly conclude that the robot can reach `(2, 6)` due to the same incomplete logic.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - While `func_2` correctly processes each test case, it relies on the flawed logic in `func_1`, leading to incorrect results.

To properly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the robot's path is checked comprehensively. The robot's movement depends on the entire grid configuration, and the function needs to verify that there is a continuous path from `(1, 1)` to `(2, n)`.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve simulating the robot's movement across the entire grid and ensuring that there is a continuous path from `(1, 1)` to `(2, n)`. This can be done by checking if there is a sequence of moves that allows the robot to traverse from the starting cell to the target cell without getting stuck.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately points out the flaw in the logic of `func_1` and the overall incorrectness of the program. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
