Output State: **The program returns two values both as 0.**

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the code `return 0, 0` simply returns two values, both of which are 0. There is no impact on the variables `n`, `k`, or `max_k` since the return statement does not reference any of these variables. Therefore, the return values are explicitly stated as 0, 0.
