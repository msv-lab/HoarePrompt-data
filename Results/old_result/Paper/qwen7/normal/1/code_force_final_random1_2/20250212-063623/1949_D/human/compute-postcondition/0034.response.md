Postcondition: `x` is the input string or integer entered by the user, `j` is 4 if `x[2]` is 'S', otherwise `j` is 3. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` (where `j` is either 3 or 4) is increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are each increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes are made to `a` and `b`.
