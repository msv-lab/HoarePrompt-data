Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list called `b`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
