Output State: **`count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 4)`, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `m` must be at least 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
