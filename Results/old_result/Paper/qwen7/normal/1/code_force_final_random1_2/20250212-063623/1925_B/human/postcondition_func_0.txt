The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two integers \( x \) and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value of \( i \) such that \( x - n \cdot i \) is divisible by \( i \) and \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \), and similarly for \( x // i \). The function prints the maximum value found for each test case.
