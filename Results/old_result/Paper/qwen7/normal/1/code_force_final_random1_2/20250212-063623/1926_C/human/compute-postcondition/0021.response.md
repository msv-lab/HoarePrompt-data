Output State: `pd['400001']` is reduced to `pd['400000']`, which is then decreased by the sum of all digits in the original value of `i` ("400001"), and `i` becomes an empty string after all iterations.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each digit of `i`. Initially, `i` is "400001". In each iteration, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the current digit `j`. After the loop completes, `i` will be an empty string because it loses one character per iteration until it is completely stripped. The final value of `pd['400001']` is adjusted by subtracting the sum of its digits, resulting in `pd['400000'] - (4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1) = pd['400000'] - 5`.
