Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `m` is the second integer input by the user.
- `n` is equal to `m`.
- The current value of `m` is `n - 1`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('Yes')
```

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` do not affect this print statement because it does not reference any of these variables. It only prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
