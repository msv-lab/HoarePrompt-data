Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` in detail to determine its correctness.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Function Purpose**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the array `a` according to the commands in `s` and return a list of remainders of the product of the remaining elements of `a` after each command.

2. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**:
   - The function constructs a new list `b` based on the values in `a` and the directions specified in `s`.
   - It then calculates the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`, storing this value in `p`.
   - Finally, it creates a list `ans` where each element is the final value of `p`, and returns this list in reversed order.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly processes the commands in `s` by appending the appropriate elements from `a` to `b`.
   - It calculates the product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` at each step.
   - It stores these intermediate results in `ans` and returns them in the correct order.

4. **Comparison with Problem Description**:
   - The problem description requires calculating the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` at each step before taking the remainder when divided by `m`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by:
     - Constructing `b` based on the commands in `s`.
     - Calculating the product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` at each step.
     - Storing these results in `ans` and returning them in the correct order.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It processes the commands in `s` and calculates the required remainders at each step.
   - The implementation matches the expected behavior as described in the problem description and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program and the function `func_1` correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
