Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0. If `a[2]` is 0 and `b[2]` is 0, then no changes are made to the lists. Otherwise, no changes are made to the lists.
