Output State: **`i` is 1 + (1 - idx_A[0]) * 1, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is A[0] + (1 - idx_A[0]) * 1, `idx_A` is [1] if the character at index 1 of `s` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and `A` is [1] if the character at index 1 of `s` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is updated to `1 + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. Since `idx_A` initially contains only one element `[1]`, `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` is `1`, and `len(idx_A)` is `1`. Thus, `i` becomes `1 + (1 - 1) * 1`, which simplifies to `1`.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. Given `A` initially contains `[1]`, `A[len(A) - 1]` is `1`, and `len(A)` is `1`. So, `x` becomes `1 + (1 - 1) * 1`, which simplifies to `1`.
- The values of `n` and `idx_A`/`A` depend on the condition of the character at index 1 of `s`. If the character is '>', then `idx_A` becomes `[1]` and `A` becomes `[1]`. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
