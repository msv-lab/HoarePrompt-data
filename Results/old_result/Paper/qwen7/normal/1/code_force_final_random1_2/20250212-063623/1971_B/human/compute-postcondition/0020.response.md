Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of the set `a` is equal to 2, the program does not change `a`. Otherwise, `a` is not equal to 2, and `b` is a string which is the sorted version of `s`, while `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order. After the execution of the if-else block, `b` is either equal to `s` or not equal to `s`.
