Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 998, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` when read from the end or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` (if `x` and `y` are valid indices), or `arr[x:n - y]` if `x` and `y` are valid indices.**

Explanation: The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` removes all spaces from the input string and assigns the result back to `arr`. This means that `arr` now contains the original input string without any spaces. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.
