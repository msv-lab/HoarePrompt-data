Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` is actually encoding the string `b` into a new string rather than decoding it.
2. The logic inside `func_1`:
   - Creates a list of unique characters from `s` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - Tries to replace each character in `s` with the corresponding character from the sorted unique characters list.
   - If a character is not found in the unique characters list, it inserts the character into the list and adjusts indices.
3. This approach is incorrect because it does not reverse the encoding process. Instead, it tries to map characters back to their positions in the sorted unique characters list, which is not the intended decoding process.

To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:
1. Identify the unique characters in the encoded string and sort them alphabetically.
2. Create a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters list to its position.
3. Replace each character in the encoded string with the character from the sorted unique characters list based on the mapping.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
