Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is a string containing the character 'S'**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a string (or it could be any type, but for simplicity, we assume it's a string). After executing the code, `nx` will contain the character 'S'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
