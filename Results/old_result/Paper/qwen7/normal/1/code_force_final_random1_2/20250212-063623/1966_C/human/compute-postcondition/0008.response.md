Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0.
   - `dp` is set to the boolean value of `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `i` is 1 and less than `n`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `tc` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `dp` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **New State:**
   - Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 2.

6. **Final State:**
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0.
   - `dp` is set to the boolean value of `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `i` is 2.

**State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0, `dp` is set to the boolean value of `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is 2**.
