Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ss in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ss`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `ss` is the current character from the string `s`.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.
   - If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is set to 0, and `ans` is updated to `ss + ans`.
   - Otherwise, the values of `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.
   - `cur` and `cnt` and `ans` are in their respective states as per the postcondition.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, the next character `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - All other variables (`cur_ss`, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans`) will retain their values unless they are modified within the loop body.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `s` remains the same (non-empty string).
- `cur_ss` remains the same (difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a').
- `cur` and `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'; `cur` and `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
