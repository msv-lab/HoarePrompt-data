Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where d1[2] = 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

The code `d1[2] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `2` in the dictionary `d1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
