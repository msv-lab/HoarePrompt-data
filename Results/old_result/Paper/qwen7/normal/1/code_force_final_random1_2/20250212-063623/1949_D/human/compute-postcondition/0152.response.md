Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (from `1` to `n+1`) for which `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing the single integer `1`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `n+1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations up to `n`. The lists `a` and `b` will have been updated based on the counts of characters `'F'` and `'S'` respectively, for each position from `1` to `n+1`. The list `sa` will contain all positions from `1` to `n+1` where the count of `'F'` is greater than `0` and the count of `'S'` is `0`. The list `sb` will always contain just the integer `1`.
