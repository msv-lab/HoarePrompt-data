Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 20; `lst` is [10, 15, 20]; `final` is [5, 10, 15]; `pk` is `mini` + 10; `elem` is 15. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` includes 15. Otherwise, the value of `final` remains unchanged.
