Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\)**.

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `cur`. This does not affect any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `cur` now explicitly set to 0.
