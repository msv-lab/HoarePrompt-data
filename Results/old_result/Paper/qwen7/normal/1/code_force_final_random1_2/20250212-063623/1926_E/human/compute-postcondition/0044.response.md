Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first input value.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the second input value.
   - `L` is an empty list.
3. **Understand the loop execution**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `n` must evaluate to `True`. In Python, this means `n` should not be `0`.

Given that `n` is an integer equal to the first input value, we need to ensure that `n` is not `0` for the loop to execute the first time.

Since `k` and `L` do not affect the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state right before the loop that needs to be modified is:

**State: `n` is an integer equal to the first input value and must not be 0**
