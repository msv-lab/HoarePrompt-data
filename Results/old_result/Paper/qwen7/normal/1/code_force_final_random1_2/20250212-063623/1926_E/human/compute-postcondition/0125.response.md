Output State: `a` is 3, `L` is [], `pow` is 16, `tot` is 9.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `L` becomes empty as the loop continues to reduce `n` until it reaches 0. The variable `a` takes on the value of the last element added to `L`, which is 3 (since `m = (n + 1) // 2` and `n` was reduced to 0 over multiple iterations). The variable `pow` is doubled in each iteration of the loop, starting from 1 and doubling 4 times (once for each element in `L`), resulting in `pow` being 16. The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, which is 3 + 3 = 6 from the first two iterations and then 6 + 3 = 9 from the third iteration.
