Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `idx` is 6
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `results` is an empty list
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`
   - `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being `int(data[5])`
   - `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` with the second element being `pf[1] ^ int(data[5])`
   - `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0]
   - `i` is 3
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is now [3]

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 4.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `idx` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `results` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `q` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `pf` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `mp` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 4.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` will be updated to [4] if `i` is within the range and the condition holds.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`idx` is 6, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being `int(data[5])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` with the second element being `pf[1] ^ int(data[5])`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 4, `mp[pf[i]]` is now [4]**
