Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (as per the loop definition: `for i in range(1, n - 1)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n-1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n-1` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, the loop will start with `i = 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must remain less than `n-1` throughout the iterations. This means `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-2`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
