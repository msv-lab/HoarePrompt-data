Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is converted to an integer from the input, `y` is converted to an integer from the input**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged, and `x` and `y` are updated to the integer values of the inputs.
