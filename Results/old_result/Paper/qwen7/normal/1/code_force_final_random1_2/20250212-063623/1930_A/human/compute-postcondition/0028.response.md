Output State: **`l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is the sum of every second element in the original list `l` from index 0 to the last even index, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code reads a list of integers from the input, splits them by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and sorts the resulting list. The variable `score` is defined based on the initial state, which means it remains unchanged. The variable `t` and `i` are also unchanged. Therefore, the only affected variable is `l`, which is now a sorted list of integers.
