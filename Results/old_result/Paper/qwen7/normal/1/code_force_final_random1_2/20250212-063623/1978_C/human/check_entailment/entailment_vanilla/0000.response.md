### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - `func_4` checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \). If \( k \) is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - `func_1` is the main function that constructs the permutation based on the given \( n \) and \( k \).

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` initializes a list `l` with values from 1 to \( n \).
   - It iteratively modifies the list by swapping elements to reduce the Manhattan value until it matches \( k \).
   - `func_2` and `func_3` handle specific swaps within the list to adjust the Manhattan value.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The algorithm seems to attempt to construct a permutation by swapping elements to minimize the Manhattan value.
   - However, the implementation logic might have some flaws, especially in handling edge cases and ensuring the correct permutation construction.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle cases where \( n \) is odd and \( k \) is even, or vice versa.
   - It should also handle cases where \( k \) is exactly the maximum possible value for a given \( n \).

6. **Testing**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement cover various scenarios, including edge cases like odd \( n \), large \( k \), and small \( n \).
   - The function should pass these tests to be considered correct.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and the problem requirements, the given implementation does not seem to correctly handle all edge cases and may fail in certain scenarios. Specifically, the logic for constructing the permutation and adjusting the Manhattan value might be flawed.

**Correctness: False**
