Postcondition: `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is calculated based on `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`, `total_matchs` is now `total_points // 2`; if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.
