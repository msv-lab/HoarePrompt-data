Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` remains unchanged, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `pos` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1, while the values of `rest`, `delta`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (which was previously decreased by `delta`) are updated accordingly.
