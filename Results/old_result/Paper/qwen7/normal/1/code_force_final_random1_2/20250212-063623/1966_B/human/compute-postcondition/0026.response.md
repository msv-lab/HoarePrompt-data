Output State: **`j` is 2, `gr` is a 2D list where either the first row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the first row, or the last row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the last row, and `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `impossible`. This does not affect the values of `j` or the 2D list `gr`. The condition about the elements in the first and last rows of `gr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `impossible` and retains the original conditions regarding `j` and `gr`.
