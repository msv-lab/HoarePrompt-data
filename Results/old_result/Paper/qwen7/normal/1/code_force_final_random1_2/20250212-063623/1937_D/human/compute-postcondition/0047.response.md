Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and the current value of `s[i]` is not less than or equal to '<', `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `B` is updated by appending `x` to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Initially, `j` was 0, so after executing `j += 1`, `j` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
