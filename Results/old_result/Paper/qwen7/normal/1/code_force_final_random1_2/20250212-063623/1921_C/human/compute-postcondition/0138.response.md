Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is set to `n`, where `n` is the original length of `arr`.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
   - `array2` is initially an empty list.

2. **Condition for `array2`:**
   - For each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `i == 0` and `arr[0] >= b / a`, then `array2` will include `arr[0] * a`.
     - For any other index `i` where `0 < i < n`, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] >= b / a`, then `array2` will include `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

3. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is set to `n`, which means it is outside the range of `0` to `n-1`.

Given that `i` is set to `n`, the loop condition `for i in range(0, n):` will not execute because `i` does not fall within the specified range. Therefore, `array2` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an empty list.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No')
```

This will simply print the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
