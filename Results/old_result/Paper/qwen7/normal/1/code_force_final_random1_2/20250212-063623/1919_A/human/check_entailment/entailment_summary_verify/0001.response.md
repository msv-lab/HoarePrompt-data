### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - Both players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them as is.
   - After each turn, one coin is removed from the current player's wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially boils down to the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because:
     - On Alice's first turn, she removes one coin, making the total odd.
     - On Bob's turn, he can always swap wallets back to make the total even again.
     - This process continues until there is only one coin left. At that point, the player whose turn it is will be forced to remove the last coin and lose.
   - If `a + b` is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the total to remain odd after her turn, ensuring she wins.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it returns 'Bob', otherwise 'Alice'.
   - This function correctly implements the logic derived from the key insight above.

4. **Main Function Analysis**:
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1()`.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Given Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1(a, b)`)**:
  - The function correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win.

- **Function 2 (`func_2()`)**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1(a, b)`.
  - It then prints the results for each test case.

### Validation Using Function Summaries:

- The function summary for `func_2()` states that it processes a specified number of test cases, reads two positive integers for each test case, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, collects the results, and prints them.
- The provided implementation matches this summary accurately.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The function summaries align with the expected behavior of the functions.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct.
