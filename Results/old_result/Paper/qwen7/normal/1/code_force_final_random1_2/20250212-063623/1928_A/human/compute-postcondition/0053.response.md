Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
- `a1` is `a` // 2, which means `a1` is the integer division of `a` by 2.
- `a2` is `a` // 2, which means `a2` is also the integer division of `a` by 2.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
