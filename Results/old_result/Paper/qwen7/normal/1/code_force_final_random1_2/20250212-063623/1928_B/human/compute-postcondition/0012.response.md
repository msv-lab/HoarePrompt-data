Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `i` is `-1`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr` when traversed from the end to the beginning, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of elements of `arr` starting from the last element up to each preceding element.

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` when read from the end to the start, and `tem` will hold the final product of all elements in `arr`.
