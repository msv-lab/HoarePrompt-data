Output State: **`l` is the list with its last two elements removed and the first element set to the third last element of the updated list, `x` is the last element of the original list before the modification, and `l` has the new element inserted at position `-k` which is `x`.**

Explanation: 
- The list `l` initially had its last two elements removed and the first element set to the third last element of the updated list.
- The variable `x` holds the last element of the original list before these modifications.
- The code `l.insert(-k, x)` inserts the value of `x` into the list `l` at the position `-k`, which is the k-th element from the end of the list.
