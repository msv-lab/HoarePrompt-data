### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes `t` and `test_cases` with predefined values, simulating multiple test cases. This part is handled correctly.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for calculating the minimum number of problems needed for each test case.
   - It takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and `a`).
   - For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level using a list `freq`.
     - The `freq` list is initialized with 7 zeros, corresponding to the 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G').
     - The frequency of each difficulty level is updated by iterating through the string `a` and incrementing the appropriate index in `freq`.
   - It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level by comparing the required number of rounds (`m`) with the available problems (`f`).
     - The expression `max(0, m - f)` ensures that if the number of available problems `f` is greater than or equal to `m`, the value is zero, meaning no additional problems are needed.
     - Otherwise, the difference `m - f` is taken, indicating the number of additional problems needed.
   - The sum of these missing problems is appended to the `results` list.
3. **Output**: The program iterates over the `results` list and prints each value, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It handles the input, processes each test case, and produces the correct output.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems needed for each test case based on the given requirements.

### Final:
**True**
