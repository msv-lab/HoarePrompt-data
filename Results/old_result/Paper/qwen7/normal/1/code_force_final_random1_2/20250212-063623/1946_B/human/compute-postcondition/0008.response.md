Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - The variable `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Check the given initial states**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `j` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `suf` is a list containing 0 (not relevant to the loop).

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
