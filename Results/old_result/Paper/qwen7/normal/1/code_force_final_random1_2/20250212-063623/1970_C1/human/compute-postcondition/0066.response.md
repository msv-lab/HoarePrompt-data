Output State: **All elements directly connected to the initial `current` node through paths of increasing distance have been added to the `queue`, and these elements are marked in the `visited` set.**

This means that starting from the initial `current` node, the loop continues to explore its neighbors, ensuring that each neighbor is only visited once by adding them to the `visited` set. The `queue` keeps track of nodes to be visited next, with their respective distances from the initial node. After all iterations, every node that can be reached from the initial node will be in the `queue` with its correct distance, and all visited nodes will be recorded in the `visited` set.
