Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n-3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i+2]` is decreased by `opNum`, and `opNum` is now equal to `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `opNum = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. Since `i` was previously set to `n-3`, `opNum` is now equal to `a[n-3]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
