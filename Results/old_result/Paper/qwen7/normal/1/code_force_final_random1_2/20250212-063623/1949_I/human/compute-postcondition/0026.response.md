Output State: **`coef[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `bipartite`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `tot`, and `ok` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `coef[2]` has been updated to 1, and the value of `i` is now 2. All other variables (`n`, `bipartite`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `tot`, and `ok`) remain in their initial states as they were not affected by the code.
