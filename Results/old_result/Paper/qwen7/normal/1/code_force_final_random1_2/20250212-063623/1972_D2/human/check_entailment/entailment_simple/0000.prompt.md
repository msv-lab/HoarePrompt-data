Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

# Annotated Program:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the square root of n does not exceed 2 * 10^3.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 5, `n` is at least 55, `m` is at least 7, `y` is greater than 10, and `cnt` is 36.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the loop and the given information:
    #
    #1. The loop starts with `x` set to 1 and increments `x` by 1 each iteration as long as `x * x <= n`.
    #2. For each value of `x`, it initializes `y` to 1 and increments `y` as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true.
    #3. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, it updates `cnt` by adding the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`.
    #
    #From the provided output states after the first three iterations:
    #- After the first iteration (`x=2`), `cnt` is 12.
    #- After the second iteration (`x=3`), `cnt` is 15.
    #- After the third iteration (`x=4`), `cnt` is 24.
    #
    #We can infer that:
    #- Each increment of `x` adds to `cnt` based on the conditions of the inner while loop.
    #- The value of `cnt` increases by 3 for each additional iteration of the outer loop.
    #
    #Following this pattern:
    #- After the fourth iteration (`x=5`), `cnt` would be `24 + 3 = 27`.
    #- After the fifth iteration (`x=6`), `cnt` would be `27 + 3 = 30`.
    #- After the sixth iteration (`x=7`), `cnt` would be `30 + 3 = 33`.
    #- After the seventh iteration (`x=8`), `cnt` would be `33 + 3 = 36`.
    #
    #Since the problem does not specify the exact stopping condition but implies the loop continues until `x * x > n`, we assume the loop completes its iterations up to `x=5` based on the given information, leading to `cnt` being 36.
    #
    #Additionally, the constraints on `n` and `m` increase with each iteration, ensuring they meet the necessary conditions for the loop to continue. Thus, `n` must be at least 55 (since \(5^2 = 25\)), and `m` remains at least 7, with `y` starting from a value greater than 10 due to the increasing `x` values.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 36

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, and since no operations within the loop modify `t`, its initial condition remains unchanged.
