Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql / ad[s]) + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, q)`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])` to its current value `b[s - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
