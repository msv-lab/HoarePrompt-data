Output State: **`i` is 4; `l` must be greater than 4; `ans` contains the value 16**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 4, \(2^4 = 16\). Therefore, `ans` now contains the value 16. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for `l` (it must be greater than 4) is still valid.
