To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

1. **Condition `rest != 0`:**
   - The loop continues as long as `rest` is not zero.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `rest` has been reduced by `delta`, and `delta` was the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` before the operation.
   - For the loop to continue, `rest` must still be non-zero. Since `rest` was reduced by `delta`, if `rest` is now zero, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `rest` must be greater than 0.

2. **Condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)`:**
   - The loop continues as long as `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `pos` was increased by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was equal to 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`. Since `pos` was incremented by 1, if `pos` is now equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are `rest` and `pos`.

State: **`rest` must be greater than 0, `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`**
