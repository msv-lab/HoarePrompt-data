The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele` from the list `lst`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `ele`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `mini` was updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. This means that `mini` now holds the minimum value encountered so far during the iterations.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` needs to be set to the next element in the list `lst`.

Since no specific values for `mini`, `pk`, or `lst` were given in the problem statement, we cannot provide concrete values for these variables. However, we can state the general condition required for the loop to continue.

State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`**
