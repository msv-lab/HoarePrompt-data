Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length n. The function returns nothing explicitly but processes each test case according to the given conditions and handles up to 10^4 test cases where the total length of all strings s does not exceed 10^6.**
