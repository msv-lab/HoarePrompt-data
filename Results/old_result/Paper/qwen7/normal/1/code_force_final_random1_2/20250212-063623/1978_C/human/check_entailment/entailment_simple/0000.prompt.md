Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    8
    
    3 4
    
    4 5
    
    7 0
    
    1 1000000000000
    
    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

Output

    Yes
    3 1 2
    No
    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    No
    Yes
    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Annotated Program:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_6()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        l = func_3(c, l)
        
    #State: The loop will continue to decrement `i` by 2 until `i` is no longer less than or equal to -1. At that point, the loop will terminate. Since `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 2 each iteration, eventually `i` will reach -1 or less. The final value of `c` will be `n // 2`, as `i` decreases by 2 each time and the loop runs `n // 2` times. `k` will be adjusted in each iteration according to the rule `k = k - i + 1`, and `l` will be updated to the return value of `func_3(c, l)` after each adjustment of `k`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= c < len(l), k is an integer such that 0 <= k < len(l), and l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.
def func_2(c, k, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[-c - k]
    l[-c], l[-c - k] = y, x
    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` with the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` swapped.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is an integer such that 1 <= c <= len(l)/2, and l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.

    #The program returns the list `l` unchanged.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}.
def func_4():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros (0, 0)
    #State: `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, and `k` is divisible by 2
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, and is divisible by 2. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `n`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is also set to `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values both as 0.
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, and is divisible by 2. `max_k` is set to `n`, and `max_k` is not less than `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns n and k, where n is an integer obtained from the first input split, and k is an integer obtained from the second input split and is divisible by 2.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers where each integer represents a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}) that has been determined to have a Manhattan value equal to k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}). Each integer in the list is a valid permutation and is distinct.
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have printed all elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
    #
    #Explanation: Given that the loop iterates over each element in the list `l` and prints them one by one using `print(i, end=' ')`, after all iterations of the loop have finished, it means every integer (permutation) in the list `l` has been printed exactly once, with no newline character (`\n`) added between them due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function. Therefore, the output will be a single line containing all the elements of `l` in the order they were originally listed, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: \n
    return
    #The program returns nothing

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.

    n, k = func_4()

        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns the new values of `n` and `k` after the function `func_4()` has been called.
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `n` is not equal to 0

    #The program returns the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))`
