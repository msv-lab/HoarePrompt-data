Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `i` is `i + 2`, and the condition for the next iteration should be checked to ensure it meets the requirement (either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<'), we break out of the loop or condition check.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or condition check without changing the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`. The conditions and requirements for the variables remain the same as they were before the execution of the `break` statement.
