State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 2** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop `for i in range(2, n):` means that `i` starts from 2 and goes up to `n-1`.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function `range(2, n)` requires `n` to be greater than 2 to include at least one value (2).
4. The initial value of `i` is set to 2 within the loop head.
5. The variable `k` is not used in the loop head and its current value (1) does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is 2.
