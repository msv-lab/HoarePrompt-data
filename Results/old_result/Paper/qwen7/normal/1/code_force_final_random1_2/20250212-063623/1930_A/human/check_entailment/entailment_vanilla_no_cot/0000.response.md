Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score according to the rules described. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the List**: For each test case, it sorts the list of numbers. Sorting ensures that when we pair the smallest numbers together, we maximize the score since \(\min(x, y)\) will always be the smaller of the two numbers.
3. **Calculating Score**: It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices. This effectively pairs the smallest available numbers and adds their minimum value to the score.
4. **Outputting Result**: Finally, it prints the calculated score for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the optimal strategy of pairing the smallest numbers, this approach ensures the maximum possible score is achieved. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
