The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the maximum value in `d`'s keys plus one, an integer `da` representing a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum value in `d`'s keys plus one. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1. Otherwise, it recursively updates `tmp` to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for every `di` in `d[da]`, sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1`, and for each `di` in `d[da]`, sets `processing[di - 1]` to 0. The function ultimately returns `tmp + 1`.
