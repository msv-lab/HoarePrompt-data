Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i]` where `i` is `len(ar) - 2` and `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `res` list by setting `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` where `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. Since `mex` is defined as `n - ar[i]` and `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is set to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. Therefore, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, which simplifies to `(n - ar[len(ar) - 2]) - ar[len(ar) - 2]` or `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
