Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 5; `lst` is [5, 10, 15]**.

Explanation: The code updates `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. Since `ele` is 5, `abs(pk - ele)` would be `abs(pk - 5)`. However, the value of `pk` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `mini` without knowing `pk`. But we know that `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and 10. The values of `ele` and `lst` remain unchanged.
