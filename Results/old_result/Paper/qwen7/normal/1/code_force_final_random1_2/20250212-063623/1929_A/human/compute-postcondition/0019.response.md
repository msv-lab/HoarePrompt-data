Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of input. Each set includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each set, the function returns a specific value based on the input data.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. The function does not take any parameters itself but expects input data in a specific format and returns a result for each test case.
