Output State: **`nx` is `xx[0][2]` (assuming `i` is 0), `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `nx` by adding the element `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. Given that `j` is 3, `j - 1` equals 2. Therefore, `nx` is updated to include `xx[i][2]`. Since `i` is not specified, we assume `i` is 0 for the calculation, making `nx` equal to `xx[0][2]`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
