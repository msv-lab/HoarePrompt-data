Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the input string, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the new input string, `new` is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` during the loop, `new2` is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` during the loop. The condition `i != len(a)` is true.**
