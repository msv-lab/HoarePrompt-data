The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates a value \(z\) based on \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, \(z\) is initially set to \((y + 1) // 2\), then adjusted if necessary based on \(x\) and another calculated value \(m\). The final value of \(z\) for each test case is the maximum value of \(z\) calculated during the process. The function does not return any value but prints the final calculated \(z\) for each test case.
