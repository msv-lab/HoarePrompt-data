Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).

4. **Input Consideration**: The value of `t` in the loop is dependent on the input provided by the user, which is converted to an integer using `int(input())`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the initial state and the input. For the loop to execute, `t` must be less than the value obtained from `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` and the value obtained from `int(input())`.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
- `int(input())` must be greater than `t` for the loop to execute.

Combining these, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), and `int(input())` must be greater than `t`**.
