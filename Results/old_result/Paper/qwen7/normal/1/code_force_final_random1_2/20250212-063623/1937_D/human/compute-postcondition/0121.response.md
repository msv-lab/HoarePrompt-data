Output State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` is greater than 0; `a` is the character at index `l-1` in string `r`; `a` is updated to `ord(a) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b` is the character at index `r` in string `B`.**

Explanation: The code `b = B[r]` assigns the character at index `r` in string `B` to the variable `b`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
