Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`; `cnt` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; `cur_ss` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `1` shifted left by `cur_ss` bits. Since `cur_ss` is defined as the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', it remains unchanged. The other variables (`cnt` and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.
