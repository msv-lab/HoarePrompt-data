The code `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 2, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is 0, `ans` is `n`, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t + 1`.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is 0, `ans` is `n`, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t + 1**.
