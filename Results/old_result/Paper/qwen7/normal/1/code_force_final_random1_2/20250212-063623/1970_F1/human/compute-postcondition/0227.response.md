Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `comand` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the second line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, `obj`, `com`, and `el` are elements of the `comand` list.**

In this step, the code unpacks the `comand` list into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. These variables now hold the respective elements from the `comand` list. The values of `t`, `time`, and `comand` remain unchanged.
