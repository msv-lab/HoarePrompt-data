Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of length `n`, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `i` and `n` as specified in the initial state, `b` remains a list of length `n` as per the initial condition, and `ans` is now an empty list.
