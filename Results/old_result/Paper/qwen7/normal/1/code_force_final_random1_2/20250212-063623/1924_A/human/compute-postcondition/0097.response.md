Postcondition: `s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is `(1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))) - 1 + 1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1`. If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` becomes `(1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))) - 1 + 1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`.
