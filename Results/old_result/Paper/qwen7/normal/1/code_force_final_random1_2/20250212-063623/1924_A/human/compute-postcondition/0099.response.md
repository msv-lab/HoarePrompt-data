Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is `(1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))) - 1 + 1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 2, so now `cnt` is 3. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `ans`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
