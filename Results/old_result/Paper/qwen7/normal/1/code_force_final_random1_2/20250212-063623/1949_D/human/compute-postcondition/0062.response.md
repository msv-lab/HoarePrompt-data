Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - The postcondition of the loop body is that if `x[1]` is equal to 'F' or 'S', then `b[2]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b[2]` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n`.

3. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to 3 (if `n` is greater than 2).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to update `j` to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `b[2]` could have been incremented based on the condition in the loop body, but since we don't know the exact value of `x[1]`, we cannot determine if `b[2]` has changed. However, we know that `b[2]` remains unchanged unless `x[1]` is either 'F' or 'S'.

6. **Final State:**
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` is a positive integer (unchanged)
   - `b[2]` remains unchanged (we don't know its exact value, but it hasn't been modified based on the given conditions)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `b[2]` remains unchanged**
