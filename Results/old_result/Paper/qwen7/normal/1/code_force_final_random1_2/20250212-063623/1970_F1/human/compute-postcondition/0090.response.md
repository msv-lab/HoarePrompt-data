Postcondition: `i` is now `elements[line[ind + 1]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1, `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind + 1)` and `(i, ind)`.
