Output State: **`ops` is a list containing six tuples: (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i`), and (`c2`, `i + 2`); `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged; `i` is `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple (`c2`, `i`) to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains five tuples involving `c1` and `i + 2` or `i`. After appending (`c2`, `i`), the list now contains six tuples. The values of `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged. Additionally, `i` is updated to `i + 2`.
