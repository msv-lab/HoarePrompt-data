Output State: **`even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least one element, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` retains its previous value, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `y`, and `y` retains its previous value which is less than half of `gap`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `2 * y` to its previous value, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
