Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `t` is the same as before, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
