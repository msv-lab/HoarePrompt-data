Output State: **`idx` is 2; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `idx` or `t`. Therefore, `idx` remains 2 and `t` remains an integer within the specified range. The new variable `results` is created and initialized as an empty list.
