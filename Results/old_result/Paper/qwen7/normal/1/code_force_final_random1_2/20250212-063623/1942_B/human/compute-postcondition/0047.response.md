Based on the initial state described:

- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `ar`.
- `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.
- `i` is `-1`, indicating the loop has completed.
- `n` is the original input integer.

The `print` statement will join the elements of the list `res` into a single string with spaces between the elements and then print it.

To determine the exact values printed, we need to understand how `mex` and `res` are computed. Since `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `ar`, and `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, each element in `res` will be `mex - ar[i]`.

Given that `i` is `-1`, it indicates that the loop has completed, and the values of `mex` and `res` have been determined.

The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in the list `res`.

Output: **what is printed**  
Output: **a space-separated string of the elements in the list res**
