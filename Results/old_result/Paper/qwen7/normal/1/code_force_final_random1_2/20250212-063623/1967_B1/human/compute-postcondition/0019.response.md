Output State: **`count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 3)`.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
