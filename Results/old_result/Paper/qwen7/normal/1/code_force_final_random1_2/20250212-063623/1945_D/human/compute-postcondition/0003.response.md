Output State: **`cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer from the input, `pos_final` is an integer from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables (`cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`) remain unchanged.
