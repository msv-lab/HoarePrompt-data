Output State: **`ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`, `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, there exists an integer `i` such that \(1 \leq i \leq x\) and `x % i == 0`. The condition `(x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0)` is true.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
