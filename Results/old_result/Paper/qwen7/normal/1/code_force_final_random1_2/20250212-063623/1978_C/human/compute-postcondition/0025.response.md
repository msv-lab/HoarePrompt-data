Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to focus on adjusting the states of `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `-1` with a step of `-2`. This means `i` decreases by 2 in each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`
   - `c` is increased by 2
   - `i` is `i - 2`
   - `k` is equal to `k - (i - 2) + 1`
   - `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `i - 1`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` decreases by 2 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i - 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is defined before the loop starts.

5. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1` (since the loop runs until `-1`).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i - 2` from the previous state.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `c` is increased by 2, but this does not affect the loop condition directly.
   - `k` is adjusted but does not affect the loop condition either.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i - 2`
- `n` remains the same
- `c` is increased by 2 (though this is not part of the loop condition)
- `k` is adjusted but not relevant for the loop condition

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`, `c` is increased by 2, `i` is `i - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 2`, and `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `i - 1`**.

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the relevant states to adjust are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 2`**.
