Postcondition: `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q with one additional element, which is either 'YES' or 'NO'. `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the left side of `v2` starting from -1 up to the position of `r - 1`. If the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, the additional element in `results` is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'.
