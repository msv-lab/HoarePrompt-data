Output State: **`sm` is equal to (2 ** k - 1) * sm.**

Explanation: The variable `sm` is updated by the equation `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`. This simplifies to `sm = (2 ** k - 1) * sm`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state, and the condition about `sm` being the maximum value among `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `n` is still valid. However, the specific value of `sm` changes according to the new formula.
