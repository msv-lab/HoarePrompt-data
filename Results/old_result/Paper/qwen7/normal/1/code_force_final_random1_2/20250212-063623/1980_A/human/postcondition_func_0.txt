The function calculates and returns a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of problem difficulties ('A' to 'G') in the given string, determines how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement for the next 'm' rounds, and sums these values to produce the result for that test case.
