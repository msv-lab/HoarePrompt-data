Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` has been fully processed, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\), if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged, otherwise `ans` is updated by adding 'j' once and 'a' repeated \(n - cnt - 1\) times to the end of `ans`, `i` is `t`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not affect the values of the existing variables like `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur_ss`, and `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
