Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means the loop variable `i` will take values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that the loop starts with `i = n-1`, the loop will not execute because `n-1` is not less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**: To make the loop execute, we need to change the initial value of `i` such that it satisfies the condition `i < n` at the start of the loop.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables mentioned (`x` and `a`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `n` at the start of the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1000**
