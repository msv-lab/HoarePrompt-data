Reasoning:
1. The program reads input data and processes it according to the problem requirements.
2. It correctly initializes variables and structures needed for processing the input.
3. The program constructs prefix XOR arrays and maps to store indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
4. For each query, it checks if the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.
5. The logic for checking the conditions to determine if a subarray is interesting is implemented correctly using binary search and map lookups.
6. The output format matches the problem's requirement of printing "YES" or "NO" for each query.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to implement the solution correctly based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
