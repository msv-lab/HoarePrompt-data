Output State: **`data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by `2 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', and an empty string is appended to `results`; `n` is an integer from the list `data` at index `idx`.**

This means that the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the `data` list at the current index `idx`. The other variables remain in their previous states, with `idx` updated by adding `2 * q` to its original value, and an empty string added to the end of the `results` list.
