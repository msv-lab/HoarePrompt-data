The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(a)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is less than `len(a)`**
