Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2
   - `a` is an empty list
   - `b` is an empty list
   - `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2
   - `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0

3. **Loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain a positive integer that is at least 3 (since `i` is now 3).

Given these points, the updated states are:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb`) do not change because they are not part of the loop head.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0**
