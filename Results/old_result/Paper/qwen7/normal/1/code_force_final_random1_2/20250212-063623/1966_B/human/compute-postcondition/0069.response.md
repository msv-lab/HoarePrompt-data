Output State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user during the loop's iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr`.**

Explanation: The line `impossible = True` sets the variable `impossible` to `True`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
