Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, with one list at index `v-1` now containing the value `[v-1, u-1] and an additional element `u-1`, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The value of `u` is decremented by 1, changing its value to `u-1`. The values of `n`, `u2vs`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
