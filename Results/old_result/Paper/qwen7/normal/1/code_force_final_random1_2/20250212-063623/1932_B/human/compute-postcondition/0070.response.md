Output State: **`ai` is now the second element of `a`; `current_year` is now equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`; `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration; `a` remains the same; `n` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code updates the `current_year` based on the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. The value of `ai` remains the second element of `a`, and `current_year` is updated accordingly. The `results` list includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration. The lists `a` and `n` remain unchanged.
