Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of standard input after stripping and splitting it, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`.**

The code `grid.append(line)` appends the `line` (a list of strings) to the list `grid`. Initially, `grid` is an empty list. After executing the code, `grid` contains one element, which is the `line`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
