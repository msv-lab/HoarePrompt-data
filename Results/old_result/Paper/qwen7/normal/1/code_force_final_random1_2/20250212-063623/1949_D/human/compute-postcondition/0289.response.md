Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is '?', and neither `i` is in `sb[:n // 4]` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4]; nx` is 'F'.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is assigned the value `'F'`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2), while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that neither `i` is in `sb[:n // 4]` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4]` remains valid.
