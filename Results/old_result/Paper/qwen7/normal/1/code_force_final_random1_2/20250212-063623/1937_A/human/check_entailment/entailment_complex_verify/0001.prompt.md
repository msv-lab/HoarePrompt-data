You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:

            n = log2(n)

    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n_cases`, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n_cases-1`, the value of `power` is determined as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it calculates a specific power of 2 and prints the result. If \( n \) is 1, it directly prints 1. Otherwise, it computes the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to \( n \), and prints the value of that power. The function reads the number of test cases first, then for each test case, it reads \( n \) and performs the calculation and printing as described.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the final position of the number `1` after performing a series of swaps on an array where initially \(a_i = i\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).

2. **Swap Operation Analysis**: The swap operation \(\texttt{swap}(k)\) involves swapping \(a_d\) and \(a_k\) where \(d\) is the largest proper divisor of \(k\). A proper divisor of \(k\) is any divisor of \(k\) except \(k\) itself.

3. **Key Insight**: For any \(k\), the swap operation will eventually move the number \(k\) to its largest proper divisor's position. This process continues until the number reaches its final stable position. The key observation here is that the number `1` will always end up at position `2` because the largest proper divisor of any number \(k > 1\) is less than \(k\), and it will keep moving towards smaller numbers until it reaches `1`.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code attempts to calculate the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(n\).
   - It uses `log2(n)` to find the highest power of 2.
   - However, the logic for determining the position of `1` is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly simulate the swap operations as described.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - For \(n = 1\), the position of `1` is clearly `1`.
   - For \(n > 1\), the position of `1` will always be `2` because the largest proper divisor of any \(k > 1\) is less than \(k\), and the number `1` will always move to position `2`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to find the position of `1` after the swap operations. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
