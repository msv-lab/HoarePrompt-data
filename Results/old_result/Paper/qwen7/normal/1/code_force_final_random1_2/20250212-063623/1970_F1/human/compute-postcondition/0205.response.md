Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 1, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, and `comand` is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code `obj, com = comand` unpacks the `comand` list into two variables `obj` and `com`. Since `comand` is already a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is set to the first element of this list, and `com` is set to the second element. The other variables (`t`, `time`, and `command`) remain unchanged.
