Postcondition: **`gr` is a grid, `impossible` remains `False`, and `i` is `n - 2`. The loop has iterated through all possible pairs of consecutive rows in the grid and found that no such pair violates the condition (`gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`). Since the condition inside the if statement `(impossible)` is not met, `impossible` remains `False`.**
