Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is the first integer entered.
- `y` is the second integer entered.
- `z` is equal to \((y + 1) // 2\).
- If \(m < a\), then the current value of `m` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15\) and `m` is recalculated as \(15 * z - y * 4\).

The `print(z)` statement will print the value of `z`.

To determine the value of `z`:

1. `z` is initially set to \((y + 1) // 2\). This means `z` is the ceiling of \(\frac{y}{2}\).

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `z`. However, we know it is derived from `y` as described.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `z` based on the formula \((y + 1) // 2\).

Output: **(y + 1) // 2**
