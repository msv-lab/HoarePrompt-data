Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the characters from `alp` list at the indices calculated by counting occurrences of each element in `rev_array` starting from its current position and subtracting 1, `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is equal to `l`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` reverses the `array` and assigns the reversed list to `rev_array`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
