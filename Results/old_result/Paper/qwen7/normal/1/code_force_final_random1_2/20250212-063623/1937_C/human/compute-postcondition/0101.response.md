Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i < n`. This means that for the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`.
3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` is 2 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `res` is an input string (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The values of `k` and `res` are not directly affected by the loop condition and are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are to `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
