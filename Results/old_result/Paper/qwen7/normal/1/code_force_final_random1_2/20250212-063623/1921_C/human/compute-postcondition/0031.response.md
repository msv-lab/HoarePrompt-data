Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `array2` contains the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` that are less than `b/a`, scaled by `a`, and the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` will be less than `f` if it was less than `f` before, otherwise it will be greater than or equal to `f`; `feat` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and splits them into a list of integers named `feat`. The values of `i`, `n`, `array2`, `arr`, `b`, `a`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial state.
