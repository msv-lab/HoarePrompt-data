Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, and `d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to be `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the updated value for `d1[3]` (since `i + 2` equals 3) is calculated as `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`. Since `d1[2] = 1`, the value of `d1[3]` becomes `l[2] - l[1] + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
