### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and returns 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly.
- **Function `func_2()`**: This function processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of inputs and printing the results.

#### Corrected Solution Analysis:
- The original assessment suggests a different approach using the parity of the number of coins in each player's wallet.
- However, the game's rules do not depend on the parity of the total number of coins but rather on the individual counts of coins in each player's wallet.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Game Dynamics**: The game is essentially a combinatorial game where the state of the game is defined by the number of coins in each player's wallet.
2. **Optimal Play**: If Alice and Bob play optimally, the game can be reduced to a simpler form where the outcome depends on the initial state of the game.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who forces the opponent into a position where they have no valid moves wins.

#### Correct Approach:
- If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, Bob wins because Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves Bob in a winning position.
- If Alice has more coins than Bob, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.
- If Bob has more coins than Alice, Bob wins for the same reason.

The provided solution in the original assessment is indeed correct. Here is the corrected version of the logic:

```python
def determine_winner(a, b):
    # If both wallets have an equal number of coins, the second player (Bob) wins
    if a == b:
        return 'Bob'
    # If the number of coins in Alice's wallet is greater than Bob's, Alice wins
    elif a > b:
        return 'Alice'
    # Otherwise, Bob wins
    else:
        return 'Bob'

def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = determine_winner(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following lines to run the function
# func_2()
```

This logic correctly simulates the game based on the rules provided. The original assessment incorrectly suggested that the sum of the coins should determine the winner, which is not aligned with the actual game dynamics.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the game rules.
