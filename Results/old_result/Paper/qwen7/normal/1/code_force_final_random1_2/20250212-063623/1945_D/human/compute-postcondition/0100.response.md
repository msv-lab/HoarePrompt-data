Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total`: The value of `total` after the previous iteration.
- `v`: The current value of `v` after the previous iteration.
- `na_frente`: The current value of `na_frente` after the previous iteration.
- `best`: The updated value of `best` after the previous iteration.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a`: A list of costs for swapping.
- `custo_pra_passar_b`: A list of costs for passing.

### Loop Head:
- The loop iterates over `v` in the range from `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop continues as long as `v` is within the specified range.

### Adjusting States:
- The only variable that changes within the loop head is `v`. It starts from `na_frente` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.
- The other variables (`total`, `na_frente`, `best`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged during the loop execution.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `v` is currently set to some value within the range `[na_frente, -1]`.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged.
   - `total` remains unchanged.
   - `best` remains unchanged.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged.
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` remains unchanged.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `v` will be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `v` will be `v - 1`.

### New State:
- `v` will be `v - 1`.
- `na_frente` remains the same.
- `total` remains the same.
- `best` remains the same.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains the same.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` remains the same.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is the same, `v` is `v - 1`, `na_frente` is the same, `best` is the same, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is the same**.

In summary, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`total` is the same, `v` is `v - 1`, `na_frente` is the same, `best` is the same, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is the same**.
