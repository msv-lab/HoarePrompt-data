You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`. `n` is not equal to 2
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 5; `l` is greater than 5; `ans` contains the values [4, 8, 16, 32].
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `l`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` is now 4. For the loop to complete its iterations, `l` must be greater than 4, and it has now reached 5. Each iteration of the loop appends `2 ** i` to `ans`, so after 3 iterations, `ans` contains [4, 8, 16]. Since `i` is incremented to 5 for the next iteration, `ans` will then contain [4, 8, 16, 32] after the fourth iteration.
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `ans` contains the elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]` until the sum of all elements equals \(2^{lk} - 2\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 1`. In each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. This means the loop will append powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-1}\). The sum of these elements will be \(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \ldots + 2^{lk-1} = 2^{lk} - 1\). However, since the loop stops just before `i` reaches `lk`, the last element `2^{lk-1}` is not included, making the sum \(2^{lk} - 2\).
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is `l - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1`. After `lk - 1` iterations (since the loop starts at `lk`), `i` will be `l - 1`. During each iteration, the loop appends `2 ** i` to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain all powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^{l-1}` in addition to the initial elements `[k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.
    #State: `i` is either `l - 1` or 5, `ans` is a list containing either [4, 8, 16, 32] or [2, 2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1], depending on the value of `k`.
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string that contains the elements of the list `ans` converted to strings and joined together with spaces. The list `ans` can either be [4, 8, 16, 32] or [2, 2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1], depending on the value of `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string containing the elements of the list `ans` converted to strings and joined together with spaces. The list `ans` can be either [4, 8, 16, 32] or [2, 2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1], depending on the value of `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns a string that contains the elements of the list `ans` converted to strings and joined together with spaces. The list `ans` can either be [4, 8, 16, 32] or [2, 2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1], depending on the value of `k`.
