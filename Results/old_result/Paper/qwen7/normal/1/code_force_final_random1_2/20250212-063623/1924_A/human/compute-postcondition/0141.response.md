Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'; the current value of `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Given that `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` was initially 0, it means that the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` was 0. After adding `1 << cur_ss` to `cur`, the bit at position `cur_ss` is now set to 1, making `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` equal to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
