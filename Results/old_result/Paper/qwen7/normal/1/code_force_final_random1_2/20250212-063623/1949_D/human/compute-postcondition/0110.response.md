Output State: **`sa` is an empty list, `xx` is a list containing `n+1` strings, each being the input received at each iteration of the loop, the lists `a` and `b` are updated such that for each index `i` from `1` to `n+1`, `a[i]` represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b[i]` represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs; `sb` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `sb`. This does not affect the values of `sa`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, or their contents. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the addition that `sb` is now an empty list.
