Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range.
