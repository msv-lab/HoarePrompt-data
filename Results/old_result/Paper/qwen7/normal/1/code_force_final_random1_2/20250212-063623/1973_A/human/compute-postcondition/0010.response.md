Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points` // 2, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` contains [-1], and `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`.**

Explanation: The code `resultats.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `resultats`. Since `resultats` was initially empty (not explicitly stated but implied by the code), after appending `-1`, `resultats` now contains `[-1]`. The conditions for `total_matchs` and `p3` remain unchanged.
