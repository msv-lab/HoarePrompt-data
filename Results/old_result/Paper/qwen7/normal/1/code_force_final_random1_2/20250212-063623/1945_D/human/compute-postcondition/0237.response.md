Output State: **`custo' is increased by `b_values[y] + a_values[0]' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y] + a_values[0]`. The code then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
