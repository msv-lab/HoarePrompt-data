num is an integer representing one of the positive integers from the input list, na, nb, and nc are non-negative integers such that 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2 and na + nb + nc = n, and sum_a, sum_b, sum_c are the current sums of the numbers in the first, second, and third groups respectively. Additionally, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists that store the numbers in the respective groups.
