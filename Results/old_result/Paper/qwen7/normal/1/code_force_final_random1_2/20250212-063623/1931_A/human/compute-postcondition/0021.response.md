Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is '', `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value remains the same.**

The code `word = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `word`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or the input value. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and only `word` is updated to an empty string.
