Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input split by space.
- `k` is the second integer from the input split by space.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from another input string using `map` and `split` functions, so `x` is also a list of integers obtained from the input().split().

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to know the behavior of `func_1(a, x, k)`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact output. Therefore, we will describe the output based on the condition inside the `print` statement.

The `print` statement will output `'YES'` if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, and `'NO'` if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `False`.

Given the information, we can only describe the output in terms of the result of `func_1`:

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, otherwise 'NO'**
