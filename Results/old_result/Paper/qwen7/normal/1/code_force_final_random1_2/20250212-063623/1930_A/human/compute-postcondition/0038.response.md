Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`. This means `i` will be the value of `2 * n - 1`.
- `score` is the original score plus the sum of elements `l[0]`, `l[2]`, ..., `l[2 * n - 2]`. Since the original score is 0, `score` will be the sum of these elements.

Given this, the `print(score)` statement will print the sum of the elements at indices `0`, `2`, `4`, ..., `2 * n - 2` from the list `l`.

Output: **the sum of elements l[0], l[2], l[4], ..., l[2 * n - 2]**
