Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `lk`.
   - The loop runs from `lk` to `l` (exclusive), so `i` will take values starting from `lk` up to but not including `l`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = lk`, the initial value of `i` should be `lk`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `l`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `lk` and should remain less than `l` throughout the loop.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The initial state of `i` should be set to `lk`.
   - The condition `i < l` must hold true for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the List `ans`:**
   - The list `ans` is given but not directly involved in the loop head. It is part of the program state outside the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is `lk`, `l` must be greater than `lk`**.

This ensures that the loop will start with `i` equal to `lk` and continue as long as `i` is less than `l`.
