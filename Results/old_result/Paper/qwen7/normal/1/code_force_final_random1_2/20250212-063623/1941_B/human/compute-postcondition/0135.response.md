Postcondition: **The list `a` will be empty, `stop` will be `True`, and `i` will be `0`. If the last element of `a` is not 0 or the second last element of `a` is not 0, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, both the last and second last elements of `a` are `0` and the condition remains unchanged.**
