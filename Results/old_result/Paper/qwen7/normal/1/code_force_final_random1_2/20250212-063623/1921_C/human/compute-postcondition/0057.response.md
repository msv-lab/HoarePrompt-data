Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `i` is set to `feat[0] + (n - 1)`.
   - `n` is greater than `feat[0] + (n - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `n > feat[0] + n - 2` or `n > feat[0] - 1 + n - 2` or `n > feat[0] - 1`. This implies that `n` must be at least `feat[0]`.

2. **Array `array2`:**
   - `array2` contains the product `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` where the difference `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than the ratio `b / a`.
   - This means that only certain differences between consecutive elements of `arr` will contribute to `array2`.

3. **Sum Condition:**
   - The sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('No')
```

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. There are no variables or expressions being evaluated within the print statement; it is a direct print of the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
