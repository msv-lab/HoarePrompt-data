Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`.**

Explanation: The code `o = sl.count('1')` counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the list `sl`, which contains the characters of the string `s`. The value of `t`, `n`, `pk`, and `sl` remain unchanged. The new variable `o` is introduced and assigned the count of '1' in `sl`.
