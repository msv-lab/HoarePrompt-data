Output State: The final value of `current_year` will be the same as `next_year` after all iterations, and it will be the result of repeatedly applying the logic inside the loop for each element in `a`. This means that `current_year` will be updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body until all elements in `a` have been processed.

In more detail, `current_year` will be incremented or adjusted according to whether it is divisible by the current element `ai` in `a`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `current_year` becomes `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, it becomes `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. This process continues for each element in `a`, and the final value of `current_year` will reflect the cumulative effect of these operations.
