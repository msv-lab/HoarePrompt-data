Based on the initial state provided:

- `tot` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer.
- `a` is the next integer in the list `L`, but since `a` is not used in the print statement, it does not affect the output.
- `pow` is multiplied by 2, so `pow` now equals `2 * pow`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

Let's break down the expression inside the print statement:

1. `2 * (k - tot) - 1`: This part calculates twice the difference between `k` and `tot`, then subtracts 1.
2. `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`: This multiplies the result from step 1 by `pow`, which has been doubled.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `pow` (which is `2 * pow`) multiplied by the expression `2 * (k - tot) - 1`.

Output: **2 * pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)**
