Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `lst[tmp] != []`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `tmp` and `lst[tmp]`.
3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `z` is an input integer.
   - `tmp` is equal to `z`.
   - `one` is True (this variable is not part of the loop condition).

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list (`[]`).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `tmp` is equal to `z`, we need to ensure that `lst[z]` is not an empty list.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `lst[z]` must not be an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`z` is an input integer; `tmp` is equal to `z`; `lst[z]` must not be an empty list**
