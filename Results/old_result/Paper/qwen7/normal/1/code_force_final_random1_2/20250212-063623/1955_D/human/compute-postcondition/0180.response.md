Output State: **`cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. The initial state of `i` being 0 and `n - m` being greater than 0 remains unchanged. The precondition that `n - m` must still be greater than 0 is also preserved. The only variable updated is `cnt_b[a[i]]`, which is incremented by 1.
