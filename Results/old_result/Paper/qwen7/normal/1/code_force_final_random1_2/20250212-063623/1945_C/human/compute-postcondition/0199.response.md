Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one` is either undefined or 1, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is either greater than or equal to 50 or a specific value, `lst` contains 2 and 2, `one_perc` remains undefined.**

Explanation: The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `lst` now contains the elements 2 and 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
