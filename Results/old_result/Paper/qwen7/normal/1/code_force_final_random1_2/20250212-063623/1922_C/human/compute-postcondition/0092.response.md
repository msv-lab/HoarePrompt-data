Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, and `d1` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

Explanation: The loop has completed all its iterations, setting `i` to `n - 2`. After the loop, `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1. The dictionary `d1` has been updated according to the conditions specified within the loop body, but the exact values in `d1` are not provided, so we only state that it has been updated accordingly. All other variables (`j`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2`) retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.
