Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]`**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `i`, `j`, and the conditions regarding their ranges relative to `sa` remain unchanged.
