Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterated over the values in `b_values`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is a valid value from `b_values`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cnt_b[i]` is 0 (this is the count of occurrences of `i` in some context, but it doesn't affect the loop condition directly).
   - `i` is the next element in `b_values` (meaning `i` has been incremented or moved to the next value in the iteration).

4. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `b_values`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to the next element in `b_values`.

**State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the next element in `b_values`**
