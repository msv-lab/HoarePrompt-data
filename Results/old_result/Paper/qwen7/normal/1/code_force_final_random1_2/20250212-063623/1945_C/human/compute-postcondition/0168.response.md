Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. All other variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
