You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `0`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series of increments calculated from all loop iterations, `i` is `t`, `m` is the final value of `m` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on \( n \) and the number of iterations up to \( m \). Specifically, it iteratively updates a running total starting from \( n \), adding a calculated increment in each iteration until the specified limit \( m \) is reached. The final printed value represents the sum of the initial \( n \) and all the increments calculated during the iterations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on a flawed approach. Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate this:

1. For the input `1 1`, the expected output is `1` because the only pair `(1, 1)` satisfies the condition. However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

2. For the input `2 3`, the expected output is `3` because the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(1, 3)` satisfy the condition. The program also outputs `3`, which seems correct in this case.

3. For the input `3 5`, the expected output is `4` because the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(1, 4)` satisfy the condition. The program outputs `4`, which is correct.

However, for larger inputs, the program's logic fails to accurately count the valid pairs. For instance, for the input `10 8`, the expected output is `14`, but the program outputs `14`. This suggests that the program might be missing some valid pairs or counting invalid ones.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the program does not correctly handle all cases and thus is incorrect.
