Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `score` is `l[0]`
   - `t` remains unchanged
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time (as per the range `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`), the next value of `i` will be `1 + 2 = 3`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`. Given that `i` is now 3 and `n` is greater than 0, `2 * n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the loop can continue, so `2 * n` must be greater than 3. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the smallest possible value for `n` is 2 (since `2 * 2 = 4 > 3`). Therefore, `n` must be at least 2.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`score` is `l[0]`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3**
