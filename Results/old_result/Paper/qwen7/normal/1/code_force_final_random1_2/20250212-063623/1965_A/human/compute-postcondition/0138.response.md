Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is equal to the length of `lis`.
- `test` is `True`.
- The loop has either printed 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`.
- The length of `lis` is even.

The print statement `print('Bob')` is executed outside of any conditional logic that would have been inside the loop. Since the problem does not specify any conditions that would prevent this print statement from executing, we assume it will execute as is.

Given that the print statement directly outputs the string 'Bob', the output will be:

Output: **Bob**
