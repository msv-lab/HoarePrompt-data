Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `s` is the next line from the standard input. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, the original values of `n`, `k`, and `s` are modified according to the if part. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, the original values of `n`, `k`, and `s` are maintained.**
