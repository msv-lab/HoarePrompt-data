Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a[i]` is increased by 1**

The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `a` or the index `i`. Therefore, we only know that `j` remains 2 and `n` remains a positive integer, while `a[i]` is increased by 1.
