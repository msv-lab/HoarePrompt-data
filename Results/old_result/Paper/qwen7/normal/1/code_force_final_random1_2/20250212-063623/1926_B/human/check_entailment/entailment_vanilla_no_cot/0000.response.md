Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape on the grid is a square or a triangle. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting '1's**: The program counts the number of '1's in each row but does not check the specific pattern required for a square or a triangle.
2. **Triangle Identification**: For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should be `2*i - 1` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`. The program does not verify this condition.
3. **Square Identification**: For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same, which is `k` for `k` rows. The program checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows is the same, which is insufficient for identifying a square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for Triangle
        def is_triangle(grid):
            for i in range(1, n):
                if len(grid[i]) != 2 * i + 1 or grid[i].count('1') != 2 * i - 1:
                    return False
            return True
        
        # Check for Square
        def is_square(grid):
            for i in range(1, n):
                if len(grid[i]) != n or grid[i].count('1') != n // 2 + 1:
                    return False
            return True
        
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print('TRIANGLE')
        elif is_square(grid):
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('NO SHAPE')

func()
```

This corrected program properly checks the patterns required for a triangle and a square and outputs the correct shape accordingly.
