Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` will contain the number `1` appended with the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Since `i` is currently 1, `sb` now contains the number `1` followed by `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
