Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the function `func_1` is attempting to decode the string, but it is incorrectly replacing characters and manipulating the `unique_chars` list. Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function `func_1` tries to replace characters in the string `s` with characters from `unique_chars`, but it does not correctly map each character in the encoded string back to its original position. Instead, it attempts to manipulate the `unique_chars` list in a way that doesn't reflect the required decoding process.

2. **Incorrect Handling of New Characters**: If the encoded string contains characters not present in the original string `s`, the function tries to insert these characters into `unique_chars`. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't maintain the correct mapping between the encoded and decoded characters.

To correctly decode the string, you need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the unique characters in the encoded string and sort them.
2. Create a reverse mapping from the sorted unique characters to their symmetric positions.
3. Decode the encoded string using this reverse mapping.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    # Step 1: Identify unique characters and sort them
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    
    # Step 2: Create a reverse mapping
    reverse_mapping = {char: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - 1 - i] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string
    decoded_str = ''.join(reverse_mapping[char] for char in s)
    
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given examples.
