Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will be such that `i` is equal to `n-1`, meaning the loop has iterated through all indices of the string `s`. The variable `A` will contain a series of integers where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, each element in `A` will be the sum of the previous element in `A` plus `(current_index - last_index_in_idx_A) * length_of_idx_A` if the current character in `s` is '>', or it will simply be the previous value of `A` if the current character is not '>'. The list `idx_A` will contain all the indices of the string `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear.

In natural language, the output state will be characterized by `i` being equal to the length of the string `s` minus one, `A` being a list of integers calculated according to the rules described above, and `idx_A` being a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear.
