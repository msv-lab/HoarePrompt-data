Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the number of test cases provided by `int(input())`, `j` will be equal to `l` for each test case, `ans` will be a list of characters from the `alp` list. For each index `j` from 0 to `l-1` for all test cases, the character added to `ans` is the one whose index in `alp` is equal to the number of times `rev_array[j]` appears in the substring of `rev_array` starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array`, minus 1. `array` will be a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer for each test case, and `rev_array` will be the reversed version of `array` for each test case.
