Output State: **`cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer from the input, `pos_final` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The variable `cases` remains unchanged, and `c` is still set to 0. Therefore, the updated states for `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers from the input, while `cases` and `c` retain their initial values.
