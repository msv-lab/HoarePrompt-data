### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - Both players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them as is.
   - After each turn, one coin is removed from the current player's wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially boils down to the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because:
     - On Alice's first turn, she removes one coin, making the total odd.
     - On Bob's turn, he can always swap wallets back to make the total even again.
     - This process continues until there is only one coin left. At that point, the player whose turn it is will be forced to remove the last coin and lose.
   - If `a + b` is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the total to remain odd after her turn, ensuring she wins.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it returns 'Bob', otherwise 'Alice'.
   - This function correctly implements the logic derived from the key insight above.

4. **Main Function Analysis**:
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1()`.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the problem statement, we need to verify the behavior of the game more thoroughly. Specifically, let's consider the sequence of moves and the state transitions.

#### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial State**: Alice and Bob start with `a` and `b` coins respectively.
- **Turn Sequence**:
  - Alice can either swap wallets or keep them. If she keeps them, one coin is removed.
  - Bob can then do the same.
  - This process continues until one player cannot make a valid move.

#### Example Walkthrough:

1. **Test Case: (1, 1)**
   - Initial state: Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 1 coin.
   - Alice removes 1 coin, now Alice has 0 coins, Bob has 1 coin.
   - Bob cannot make a valid move (no coins left), so Bob loses. (Correctly identified as Bob).

2. **Test Case: (1, 4)**
   - Initial state: Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 4 coins.
   - Alice swaps wallets, now Alice has 4 coins, Bob has 1 coin.
   - Bob removes 1 coin, now Alice has 4 coins, Bob has 0 coins.
   - Alice cannot make a valid move (no coins left), so Alice loses. (Correctly identified as Alice).

3. **General Case**:
   - For any `a` and `b`:
     - If `a + b` is even, Alice will eventually be forced to remove the last coin and lose.
     - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can always ensure the total remains odd after her turn, forcing Bob to lose.

#### Verification:

- The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
- The main function `func_2()` correctly processes each test case and prints the results.

Given the detailed walkthrough and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Final:
**True**
