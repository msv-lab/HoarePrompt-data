Postcondition: `k` is a list that contains the count of '1's from each input string `b` that contained '1'. If an input string `b` did not contain '1', it is not included in the list `k`. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the postcondition remains as is. Otherwise, the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.
