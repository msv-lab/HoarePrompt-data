Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
