Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not compute the product of the array elements modulo `m` before removing elements based on the commands. Instead, it tries to compute the product in reverse order, which is incorrect.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Compute the product of the remaining elements modulo m
        for j in range(i):
            p = (p * a[j]) % m
        b.append(p)
        
        # Process the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            del a[0]
        else:
            del a[-1]
    
    return b
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize the product `p` to 1.
2. **Loop through the commands**: For each command, compute the product of the remaining elements in the array modulo `m`.
3. **Append the result**: Append the computed product to the result list `b`.
4. **Process the command**: Depending on the command ('L' or 'R'), remove the appropriate element from the array.
5. **Return the result**: Return the list `b` containing the results of the product computations.

This approach ensures that the product is computed correctly for each step, and the elements are removed based on the commands as specified in the problem statement.
