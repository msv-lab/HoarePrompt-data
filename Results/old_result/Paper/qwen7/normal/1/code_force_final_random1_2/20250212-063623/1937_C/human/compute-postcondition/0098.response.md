Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` and `k` both have the value 2, `n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `res` remains an input string with its current value being '<'.
