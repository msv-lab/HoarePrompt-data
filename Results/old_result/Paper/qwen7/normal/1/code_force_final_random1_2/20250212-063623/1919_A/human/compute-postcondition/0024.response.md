Functionality: **The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two positive integers (`a` and `b`) and calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner based on the inputs. It collects the results of these calls in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, which include the winner for each test case along with the original values of `a` and `b`.**
