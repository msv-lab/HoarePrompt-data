Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year + ai`.**

Explanation: The code updates `next_year` to be `current_year + ai`. Since `current_year` is now equal to `next_year` before this line of code is executed, after executing `next_year = current_year + ai`, `next_year` becomes `current_year + ai`. Therefore, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year + ai`.
