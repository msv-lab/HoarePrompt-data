Based on the initial state provided:

- `sm` is equal to either \(2 + \text{suf}[n] + 2 \times (10^9 + 7)\) or \((2 + \text{suf}[n]) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), depending on whether `sm` is less than 0.
- If `sm` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

Given this, let's break down the possible scenarios for `sm`:

1. **If `sm < 0`:**
   - `sm` would be assigned the value of \(2 + \text{suf}[n] + 2 \times (10^9 + 7)\).
   - Since \(10^9 + 7\) is a large number, adding it twice ensures that the result is significantly larger than any negative value of `sm`.

2. **If `sm >= 0`:**
   - `sm` would be assigned the value of \((2 + \text{suf}[n]) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - This ensures that `sm` is always non-negative and within the range of \(0\) to \(10^9 + 6\).

In both cases, the value of `sm` is either a large positive number (if `sm < 0`) or a non-negative number (if `sm >= 0`).

Since the exact value of `suf[n]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `sm`. However, we know that `sm` will be a non-negative number due to the modulo operation if `sm >= 0`, and a large positive number if `sm < 0`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `sm`, which is either a large positive number or a non-negative number.

Output: **sm (where sm is a non-negative number if sm >= 0, otherwise a large positive number)**
