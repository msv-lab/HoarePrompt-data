Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 1 or 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- The element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is either `nx` or `'?'`.
- If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `j` ranges from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is either 1 or 2.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range specified by the loop head, i.e., `1 <= j <= n`.

### Determining the Next State
- Since `j` is currently 1 or 2, the next value of `j` will be 2 if `j` was 1, and 1 if `j` was 2.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
- The condition for the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` being either `nx` or `'?'` does not change because it is not modified by the loop head.
- The conditions regarding `nx` being 'S' or 'F' based on the quarters of `sb` also remain unchanged.

### Adjusted States
- `j` will be 2 if it was 1, otherwise it will be 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- The condition for the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` being either `nx` or `'?'` remains the same.
- The condition for `nx` being 'S' or 'F' based on the quarters of `sb` remains the same.

### Final State
State: **`j` is 2 if it was 1, otherwise 1, `n` is greater than 0, the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is either `nx` or `'?'`, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'**.
