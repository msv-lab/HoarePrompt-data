Output State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is equal to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables that were true before the operation still hold.
