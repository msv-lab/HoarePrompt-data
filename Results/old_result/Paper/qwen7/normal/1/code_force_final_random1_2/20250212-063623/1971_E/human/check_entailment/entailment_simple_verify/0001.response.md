### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `b` as specified. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distances between consecutive points in arrays `ad` and `bd` are calculated correctly. This part is also handled correctly.

3. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The speeds between consecutive points are calculated correctly and stored in array `v`. This part is handled correctly.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment where the queried point `ql` lies. This part is handled correctly.

5. **Time Calculation**:
   - If the queried point exactly matches one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time. This part is handled correctly.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the additional time taken to travel from the previous known point to the queried point using the speed for that segment. However, there is a critical flaw in this calculation. The formula used is:
     ```python
     m += bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]
     ```
     Here, `bd[s]` is the distance between `a[s]` and `a[s - 1]`, but the speed `v[s - 1]` should be used instead of `bd[s] / ad[s]`. The correct formula should be:
     ```python
     m += v[s - 1] * (ql - a[s - 1])
     ```

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program formats the output correctly, printing the time for each query on the same line separated by spaces. This part is handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct but overlooks a critical error in the time calculation. The program incorrectly uses `bd[s]` instead of `v[s - 1]` to calculate the additional time. This mistake can lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the mistake in the time calculation formula.
