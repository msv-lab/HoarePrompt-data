Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Since `mex` is equal to `n`, the updated state of `res` is such that each element `res[i]` is now equal to `n - ar[i]`. The values of `i`, `ar`, `n`, and `mex` remain unchanged from their initial states.
