You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `t` will be the last integer from input, `v` will be the second last integer from input, `num` will be a list containing all integers from input where `t` was 3, and `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1, or it will remain unchanged if no such `v` exists; `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2, or it will remain unchanged if no such `v` exists.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `count_num` will be the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive. The variables `i`, `t`, `v`, `num`, `start`, and `end` will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `i` will be the last element of `num` processed, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1 (or unchanged if no such `v` exists), and `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2 (or unchanged if no such `v` exists).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running through all iterations of the loop, `count_num` will hold the count of numbers in the list `num` that are between `start` and `end`, inclusive. The values of `i`, `start`, and `end` will reflect the last processed value and the range defined by the conditions in the loop.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `count_num` will be the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive. The variables `i`, `t`, `v`, `num`, `start`, and `end` will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `i` will be the last element of `num` processed, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1 (or unchanged if no such `v` exists), and `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2 (or unchanged if no such `v` exists). The condition `start > end` is false.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
