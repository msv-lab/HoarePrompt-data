Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `l`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < l`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `j` is equal to `l`.
   - `ans` contains the character from `alp` list which is at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array` minus 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is equal to `l` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again because the condition `j < l` will be false (since `j == l`).
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `j` or `l`.

5. **Conclusion**: The loop will not execute again because the condition `j < l` is not met. Hence, the states of `j` and `l` do not change, but we need to ensure that the loop does not execute again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `l`, `ans` contains the character from `alp` list which is at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array` minus 1.**
