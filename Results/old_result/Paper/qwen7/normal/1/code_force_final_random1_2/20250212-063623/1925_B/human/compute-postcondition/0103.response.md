Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `x` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` remains a non-negative integer, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division result `x // i`. If the condition in the if statement is true, `ans` will be set to `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous maximum value.
