Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 2, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and `x` and `n` are updated to the values of the two integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, including `t`, `q`, `x`, `n`, `i`, and the values of `x` and `n` being updated to the values of the two integers inputted by the user.
