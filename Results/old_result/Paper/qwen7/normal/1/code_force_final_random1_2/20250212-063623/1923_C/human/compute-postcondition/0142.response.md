Output State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l`, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the values [2, `i`], `c` is a list containing the values [1, `j`].**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Since `c` was initially `[1]`, after appending `j`, `c` becomes `[1, j]`. The values of `x`, `j`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
