Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an updated input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the updated `s`, `b` is a sorted string of the updated `s`.**

Explanation: The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the characters in the string `s` and joins them back into a single string `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged.
