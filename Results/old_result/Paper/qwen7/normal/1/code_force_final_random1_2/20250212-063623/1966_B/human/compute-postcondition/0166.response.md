Output State: **The final value of `tc` is `t-1`, `t` remains the same, `n` and `m` remain as their last values entered during the loop's execution, `gr` is a list containing exactly `n` elements, each being a string representing a row of the grid as input during the loop's execution, `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the final evaluation of the conditions inside the loop.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, `tc` will have reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `n` and `m` will be the dimensions of the grid as they were last updated during the loop's execution. The list `gr` will contain all the rows of the grid as input. The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `gr`. The variable `ans` will be 'NO' if any of the conditions to set it to 'NO' were met during the loop's execution; otherwise, it will remain 'YES'.
