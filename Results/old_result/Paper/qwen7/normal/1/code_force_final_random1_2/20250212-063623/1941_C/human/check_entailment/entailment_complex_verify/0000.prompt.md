You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `a` is determined by the input for each test case, `s` is the string input for each test case, `x` is the total count of occurrences of 'map' across all strings, and `y` is the total count of occurrences of 'pie' across all strings.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `a` will take on the value of the last input integer provided, `s` will be the last string input. However, since the loop processes each string individually and counts 'map' and 'pie' occurrences separately for each string, `x` and `y` will accumulate the counts of 'map' and 'pie' across all strings processed. Thus, `x` and `y` represent the grand totals of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences respectively, summed up from all the input strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), a positive integer \( n \), and a string \( s \) of lowercase Latin letters with length \( n \). For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string \( s \), and prints the sum of these counts. The function accumulates these counts across all test cases and outputs the total counts of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences after processing all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. It simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of deletions required. For example, in the input "mmapnapie", the program would output 2 because it counts both "map" and "pie", but the correct solution is to remove only 2 characters ('m' and 'e') to make the string "mmapnapie" beautiful.
