Postcondition: `start` is 3, `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, and 2, and `nums[3]` is decreased by 1. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is truthy (i.e., `nums[4]` exists and is not 0), then `start` is 3, `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, and 2, and `nums[3]` is decreased by 1. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is falsy (i.e., `nums[4]` does not exist or is 0), the function returns None.
