Output State: **The program returns the value of `l` which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is increased by 2, `i` is `i - 2`, and `k` is equal to `k - (i - 2) + 1`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**

This output state describes the final value that the program returns. It is the result of calling `func_3(c, l)` with `c` incremented by 2, `i` decreased by 2, and `k` adjusted according to the given formula, ensuring `k` remains non-zero and greater than or equal to `i - 1`. The function `func_2` then returns this value as `l`.
