Output State: **`i` is `m` or `m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `curr` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `curr -= 1` decrements the value of `curr` by 1. Given that `curr` was previously incremented by 1, it now becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
