Output State: **`zero` is 3, `zero_perc` is 30, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 3`, `one` is `o - 1`, `lst` contains `[i + 1]`**

Explanation: 
- The line `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`.
- Given `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` becomes `n - 1`.
- Therefore, `lst` now contains `[n - 1]`.
- All other variables (`zero`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `one`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
