Based on the initial state provided:

- \( i = n - m - 1 \)
- \( n - m > 0 \)
- \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i]] \) is incremented by 1 if \( a[i] \) is in \( b\_values \) and \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i]] \) is greater than 0
- \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i + m]] \) is decremented by 1 if \( a[i + m] \) is in \( b\_values \) and \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i + m]] \) is greater than 0
- \( \text{curr} \) is increased by 1 if \( a[i + m] \) is in \( b\_values \), otherwise it remains unchanged
- \( \text{ans} \) is incremented by 1 if \( \text{curr} \geq k \) and \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i + m]] \geq 0 \)

We need to determine the value of `ans` after executing the code snippet.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - \( i = n - m - 1 \)
   - \( n - m > 0 \) implies that \( i \) is a valid index within the array bounds.
   - \( \text{cnt\_b} \) is a dictionary where keys are elements from the array \( a \) and values are counts of those elements.
   - \( \text{curr} \) starts at 0.
   - \( \text{ans} \) starts at 0.

2. **Conditions for Incrementing/Decrementing:**
   - \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i]] \) is incremented if \( a[i] \) is in \( b\_values \) and \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i]] > 0 \).
   - \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i + m]] \) is decremented if \( a[i + m] \) is in \( b\_values \) and \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i + m]] > 0 \).

3. **Condition for Increasing \( \text{curr} \):**
   - \( \text{curr} \) is increased by 1 if \( a[i + m] \) is in \( b\_values \).

4. **Condition for Incrementing \( \text{ans} \):**
   - \( \text{ans} \) is incremented by 1 if \( \text{curr} \geq k \) and \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[i + m]] \geq 0 \).

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- Since \( i = n - m - 1 \), the value of \( a[i + m] \) is \( a[n - 1] \).
- If \( a[n - 1] \) is in \( b\_values \) and \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[n - 1]] > 0 \):
  - \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[n - 1]] \) is decremented.
  - \( \text{curr} \) is increased by 1.
  - \( \text{ans} \) is incremented by 1 if \( \text{curr} \geq k \) and \( \text{cnt\_b}[a[n - 1]] \geq 0 \).

However, since no specific values for \( a \), \( b\_values \), \( k \), or the exact state of \( \text{cnt\_b} \) are provided, we cannot determine the exact value of \( \text{ans} \). But based on the logic, if the conditions are met, \( \text{ans} \) would be incremented by 1.

### Conclusion:
Output: **1** (assuming the conditions are met and \( \text{ans} \) is incremented by 1).
