Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` to the variable `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `n` is still greater than 0. The new value of `a` is determined based on the current values of `B[r - 1]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, and `i`.
