Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `a` is 1
   - `L` is [1, 1, 1]
   - `pow` is 2
   - `tot` is 3

2. **Loop Information**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   Here, `t` is the number of iterations of the loop. From the initial state, we know that `t` is 3 because the loop has already completed 3 iterations.

3. **Loop Execution**: Since the loop has already completed 3 iterations, we need to determine the state at the start of the next (4th) iteration. However, the loop is defined to run for `t` iterations, and since `t` is 3, there is no 4th iteration.

4. **Adjusting States**: Given that the loop is defined to run for exactly 3 iterations and has already completed them, there is no need to adjust any states for an additional iteration. The loop is complete, and the final state after all iterations is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which doesn't exist in this case) would be the same as the current state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1, 1], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3**
