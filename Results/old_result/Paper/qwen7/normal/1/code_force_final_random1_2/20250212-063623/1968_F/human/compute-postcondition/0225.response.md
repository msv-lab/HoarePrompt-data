Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `idx` is 2 * n + 3, `data` is a list of values, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 2]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `it2` using `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. This means `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` just before `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
