Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer input by the user for the last iteration, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed for the last iteration, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if `x` is not -1 and `n - y - 1` is within the bounds of `arr`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, there will be only one remaining iteration left to process. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will reflect the state of the last input provided by the user, as all other inputs have been processed in previous iterations.
