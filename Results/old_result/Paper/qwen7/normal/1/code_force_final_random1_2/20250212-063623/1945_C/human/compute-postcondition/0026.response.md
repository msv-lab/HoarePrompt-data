Output State: **`zero` is 1 or 0; `zero_perc` is 0; `i` is 1; `one_perc` is -100**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `zero` is either 1 or 0.
- `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 1, `zero_perc` becomes `zero * 100 // 2`. This results in `zero_perc` being 0 because `zero` is either 1 or 0, and both 100 // 2 and 0 // 2 are 0.
- `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. However, the variable `o` and `one` are not defined in the given initial state, and `n` is also not defined. Assuming `o` and `one` are meant to be `zero` and `i` respectively, and `n` is not specified, we proceed with the available information. Given `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(zero - 1) * 100 // (n - 1 - 1)`. Since `zero` is either 1 or 0, `(zero - 1)` would be -1 or -1, resulting in `-100 // (n - 2)`. Without the exact value of `n`, we assume the simplest case where `n` is just greater than 1, making the denominator at least 1, thus the result is -100.
