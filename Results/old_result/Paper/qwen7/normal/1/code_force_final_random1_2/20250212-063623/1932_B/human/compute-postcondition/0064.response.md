Output State: **`current_year` is `ai`, `next_year` is `(ai // ai + 1) * ai`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one, `ai` is the first element of `a`, and `current_year % ai != 0`**

Explanation: The code updates `current_year` to the next multiple of `ai`. Since `current_year` was initially set such that `current_year % ai != 0`, the next year (`next_year`) is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. This ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. All other variables remain unchanged.
