Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r`; `b` is equal to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` if `l - r > 0`. If `l - r` is not greater than 0, the conditions remain as initially stated.
