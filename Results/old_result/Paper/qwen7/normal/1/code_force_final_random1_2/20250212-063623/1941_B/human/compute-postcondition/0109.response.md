Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers where each element is decremented by `opNum`.
- `stop` is `True`.
- `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `opNum` (with `i` incremented by 1).

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables or the state of the list `a`.

Output: **NO**
