Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `j` is `n + 1`**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was not defined before this line, it is initialized to an empty string. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
