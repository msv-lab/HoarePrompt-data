Output State: **`power` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1**

The code initializes the variable `power` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `n_cases`, or any other variables. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
