Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is an index such that `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the postcondition was defined. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the postcondition still holds true. We simply break out of the loop or conditional block.
