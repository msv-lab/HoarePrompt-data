Output State: **s is a string of length n, n is the length of the string s, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'**.

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The string `s` and its content remain unchanged. Therefore, the length of `s` is now stored in `n`, while `s` itself remains a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
