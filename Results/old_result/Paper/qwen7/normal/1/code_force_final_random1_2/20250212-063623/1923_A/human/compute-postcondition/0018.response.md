Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 998, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the same as before, `z` is the same as before, `x` is assigned the value of `arr.find('1')`**.

This means that `x` is now assigned the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`. If '1' is not found, `x` remains -1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
