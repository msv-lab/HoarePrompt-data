The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the sorted list. It then prints this difference for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the differences for each test case.
