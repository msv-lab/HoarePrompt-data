Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the last pair of numbers entered through input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, and the condition involving `m` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `m`, while keeping the other variables as they were initially.
