Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is an input string.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
- `h` is not '00'.
- `int(h)` is greater than 12.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `h` is the first two characters of the string `s`.
2. `int(h)` converts these two characters into an integer.
3. It is given that `int(h)` is greater than 12. Therefore, `int(h)` must be one of the following: 13, 14, 15, ..., 59 (since `int(h)` cannot be 60 or more because it would exceed the typical range for hours in a 24-hour clock).

The code snippet `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')` subtracts 12 from `int(h)` and then formats the result to ensure it is preceded by a '0' if necessary. 

For example, if `int(h)` is 13, then `int(h) - 12` is 1, and the output will be '01'. If `int(h)` is 15, then `int(h) - 12` is 3, and the output will be '03'.

Therefore, the output will be a zero-padded string representing the value of `int(h) - 12`.

Output: **'0[int(h) - 12]' where int(h) is an integer greater than 12 and less than or equal to 59**
