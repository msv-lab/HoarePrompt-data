Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
