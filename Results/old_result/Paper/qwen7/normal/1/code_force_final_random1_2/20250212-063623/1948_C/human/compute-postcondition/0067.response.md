Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two strings of equal even length consisting of "<" and ">". For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` (where `i` is odd) such that either `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`. If such an index is found, it prints "No" and stops processing further. If no such index is found after checking all possible indices, it prints "Yes".**
