Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of three integers: t, a, and b. For each test case, it checks if t is within the range of 1 to 10^4, and a and b are within the range of 1 to 10^9. Based on these conditions, the function processes each test case and returns specific outputs for each case.**

However, since the exact output for each case is not specified in the given information, the functionality can be described as processing a series of test cases with the given constraints and returning appropriate results for each test case.
