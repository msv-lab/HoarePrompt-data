Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is either 'FFS' or 'FS', `j` is 3**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the character at index `j - 1` (which is 2) of the list `xx[i]` (where `i` is 1). Since `nx` can be either 'FF' or 'FSS', adding the third character from `xx[1]` will result in 'FFS' if `xx[1][2]` is 'S', or 'FS' if `xx[1][2]` is 'F'. However, since the exact value of `xx[1][2]` is not given, we consider both possibilities. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
