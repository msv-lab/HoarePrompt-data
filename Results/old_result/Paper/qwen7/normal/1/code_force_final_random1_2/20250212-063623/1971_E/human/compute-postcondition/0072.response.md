Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 1, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` to its current value, which was `b[s - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
