Output State: **`sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is less than 0), or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is greater than or equal to 0), `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), `j` is `t`, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of the second element of the list `b` (after converting it to an integer) to the variable `k`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the values of `sm`, `a`, `j`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
