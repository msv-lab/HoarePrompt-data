Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `m` is an integer from the input.
- `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `t` is the same as before.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will print the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `t`.

Output: **Yes**
