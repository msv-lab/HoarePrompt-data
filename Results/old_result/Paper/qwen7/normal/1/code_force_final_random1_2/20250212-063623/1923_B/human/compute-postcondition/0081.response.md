Output State: **`rest` is greater than `2*delta`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**.

This means that the value of `delta` is now the minimum between the current value of `rest` and the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The conditions on `rest` and `pos` remain unchanged.
