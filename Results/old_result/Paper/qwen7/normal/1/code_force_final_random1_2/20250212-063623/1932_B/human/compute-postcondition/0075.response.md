Output State: **`ai` is the third element of `a`, `current_year` is the value of `next_year`, `results` includes the updated `next_year` for the current iteration, `a` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `next_year` is calculated using the given formula, and this updated value is included in the `results` list for the current iteration.
