Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
            if a1 != b:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        if b % 2 == 0:
            b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
            if b1 != a:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        print('No')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer input split from input, `b` is the second integer input split from input. If `a` or `b` is an even integer, `a` is divided by 2 to get `a1` and `a2` (which are the same), and `b` remains unchanged unless `b % 2 == 0` and `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, in which case `b` remains unchanged as well. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space. If `a` or `b` is even, `b` is divided by 2, and the result is stored back in `b`. If `b` is even, it is split into two equal parts `b1` and `b2`, where `b1 = b2 = b // 2`. The condition `b1 != a` is checked, and if it holds, `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space, and if either `a` or `b` is even, `a` and `b` are divided by 2 repeatedly until `b` equals `a`, at which point the function terminates with the updated values of `a` and `b`. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, `a` and `b` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
