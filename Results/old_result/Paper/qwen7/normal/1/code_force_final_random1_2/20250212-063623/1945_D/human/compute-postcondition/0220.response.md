Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`**.

This means that the variable `custo` has been increased by the value of `a_values[y]`, where `y` is `max_p - 1`. The conditions and values of `max_p` and the relationship between `a_values[y - 1]`, `b_values[y]`, and `a_values[y]` remain unchanged.
