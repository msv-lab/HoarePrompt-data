Postcondition: `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is int(`n` / 2), `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `t + 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.
