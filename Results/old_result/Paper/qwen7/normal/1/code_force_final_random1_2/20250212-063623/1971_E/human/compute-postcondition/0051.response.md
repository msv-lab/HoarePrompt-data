Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, q)`, `ql` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `ql`. Since `input()` reads a line from input and `int()` converts it to an integer, `ql` now holds the value of the integer input. The values of `q`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `s`, and the expression for `ql` (which involves `a[s - 1]`) remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
