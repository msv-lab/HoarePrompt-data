Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `count = m + 1`: This means `count` starts at `m + 1`.
   - `countmins = m - 1`: This means `countmins` starts at `m - 1`.
   - `g = 0`: `g` is initialized to 0.
   - `ans = n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int(1 / 5) + 1`: We need to evaluate this expression.
     - `int(n / 2)`: This is the integer division of `n` by 2.
     - `int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2)`: This is the integer division of `(int(n / 2) - 1)` by 2.
     - `int(1 / 5)`: This is the integer division of 1 by 5, which is 0.
     - So, `ans = n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + 0 + 1`.
     - Simplifying further, `ans = n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 2`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `g < countmins`.
   - Each iteration, `g` is reduced by `countmins`.
   - Since `g` starts at 0 and `countmins = m - 1`, `g` will never be greater than or equal to `countmins` because `g` is always 0.
   - Therefore, the loop does not execute any iterations.

3. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - Since the loop does not execute, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 2`.

Given the above steps, the final value of `ans` is determined by the formula provided.

Output: **n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 2**
