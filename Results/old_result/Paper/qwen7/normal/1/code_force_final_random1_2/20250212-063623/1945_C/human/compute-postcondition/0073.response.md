Postcondition: `lst` must contain at least one less element than before, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` is now `[elem, elem]` where `elem` is the element that minimizes `abs(pk - elem)`, or `final` remains an empty list if no such `elem` exists.
