Based on the initial state described:

- `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces.
- `s` is the next line from the standard input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(2 * n)
```

Here, the `print` statement will print twice the value of `n`. Since `n` is explicitly defined as the first integer from the input split by spaces, we can directly use its value in the output.

Output: **2 * n (where n is the first integer from the input split by spaces)**
