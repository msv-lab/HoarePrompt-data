#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of strings representing the field, b is an integer representing the number of steps in the game.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns the first element of list 'a' added to the value of 'dx', and the second element of list 'a' added to the value of 'dy'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `a` and an integer `b`. It returns a tuple where the first element is the first string in list `a` incremented by the value of `dx`, and the second element is the second string in list `a` incremented by the value of `dy`.
