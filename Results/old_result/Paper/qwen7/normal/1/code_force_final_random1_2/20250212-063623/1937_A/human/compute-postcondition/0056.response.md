Output State: `n` must be greater than 1; `power` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `power < n` must no longer be true because the loop stops when `power` is no longer less than `n`. Since `power` starts from 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, the final value of `power` will be equal to `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
