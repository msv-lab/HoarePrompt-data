Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance` is 0; `balance_info` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
    if s[i] == '(':
        balance += 1
    else:
        balance -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is either 0 or 1, `balance` is either 1 or decreased by 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being an unspecified value, and `s[i]` is the first or second character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2; `balance` is either 1, 0, or -1; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the second or third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2 or 3, `balance` is either 0, -1, or 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false, and `balance_info` now includes an additional instance of `BalanceInfo` with the updated balance, current index `i`, and the character `s[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
