The function processes a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. It also uses a processing list, an integer `da`, and a rank list. If the list associated with the key `da` in dictionary `d` contains only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in the list associated with `da`, updating a temporary variable `tmp` with the minimum value obtained. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns this value.
