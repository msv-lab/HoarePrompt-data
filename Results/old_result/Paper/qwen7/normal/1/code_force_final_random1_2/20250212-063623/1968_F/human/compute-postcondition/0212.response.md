Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is `2 * n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding value from the `data` list starting from `idx - n` to `idx - 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is computed as the XOR of all previous elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from the `pf` list and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `a` where that key appears.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, the variable `i` will be `n + 1`, `idx` will be `2 * n + 1`, the list `a` will contain the first `n + 1` elements from the `data` list starting from the position specified by `idx - n` to `idx - 1`, the list `pf` will store the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to each index, and the dictionary `mp` will map each unique cumulative XOR value to a list of indices in `a` where that XOR value occurs.
