You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        h = s[0]
        
        j = -1
        
        for i in s[1:]:
            j += 1
            if h < i:
                break
            else:
                ans += 1
        
        p = j
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans1 = 0
        
        s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
        
        z = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        
        print(max(ans, ans1))
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state will have `ans1` as the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`. Here, `ans` is the count of elements in the list `s` starting from index 1 that are less than or equal to the first element `h` of the list `s` (before the swap), and `ans1` is the count of elements in the list `s` that are equal to `h` plus the count of elements less than `h` if `s[0]` was not equal to `h` initially.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ans1` will reflect the highest possible count of elements in the list `s` that meet the specified conditions, effectively considering both scenarios where elements are less than or equal to `h` and where elements are equal to `h` with the additional condition on `s[0]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a single integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers where each integer in `a` is between 1 and 10^9. For each test case, the function processes the list `a` and returns a value based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
