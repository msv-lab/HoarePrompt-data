### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` against the problem description and the given function summary.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s` of commands.
   - This part of the assessment is accurate.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results.
     - Two pointers, `l` and `r`, are used to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - **Constructing List `b`**:
     - The function iterates through the string `s` and appends the corresponding element (leftmost or rightmost) to `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
     - However, there is a logical error here. The function should be removing elements from `a` based on the commands, but instead, it is appending them to `b`. This means `b` will contain the elements that would have been removed, not the elements that remain after processing the commands.
   - **Product Calculation**:
     - The function reverses the list `b` to start calculating the product from the last command.
     - It initializes `p` to 1 and iterates over the reversed list `b`, updating `p` with the product modulo `m` and appending the result to `ans`.
     - The final step of reversing `ans` ensures the correct order of remainders.
   - **Output**:
     - The main loop correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

The key issue lies in the construction of the list `b`. Instead of storing the elements that remain after processing the commands, the function stores the elements that would have been removed. This means the product calculation and the final output will be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic of removing elements from the array `a` based on the commands. The constructed list `b` should contain the remaining elements, not the removed ones.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
