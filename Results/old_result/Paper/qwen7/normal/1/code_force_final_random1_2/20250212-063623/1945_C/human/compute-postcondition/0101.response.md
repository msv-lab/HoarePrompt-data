Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 because `range(n-1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `lst` (or another relevant list), but since `lst` is empty, `n` must be 0 initially.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute as long as `n - 1` is non-negative. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
