Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the variable `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute. Since `t` is already stated to be a positive integer within the specified range, no adjustment is necessary for `t`.

3. **Adjust the State**: The only state that needs to be considered for the loop to execute is `t`, which must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
