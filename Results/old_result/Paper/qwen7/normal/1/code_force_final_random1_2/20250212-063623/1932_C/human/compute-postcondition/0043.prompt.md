You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of length `n`. For each index `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, if `s[j]` is 'L', then `b[j]` is equal to `a[l + j]`, otherwise `b[j]` is equal to `a[r - j]`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of length `n`, `v` is the first element of `b`, `p` is `p * v % m` (where `v` is the first element of `b`), `ans` is a list containing all elements from `p` repeated `n` times.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `v` will be the first element of the list `b` because the loop iterates over `b` in reverse order. The variable `p` will be updated `n` times, each time multiplying the current value of `p` by the next element in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. Since `p` starts as 1 and gets updated in each iteration, by the end of the loop, `p` will be the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`. This final value of `p` is appended to `ans` in each iteration, resulting in a list where every element is equal to the final value of `p`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list where each element is the final value of `p` (which is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`), and the list is reversed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list where each element is the final value of `p` (which is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`), and the list is reversed.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list where each element is the final value of `p` (which is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`), and the list is reversed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
