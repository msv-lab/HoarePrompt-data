Output State: **`total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is calculated based on `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`, `total_matchs` is now `total_points // 2`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value `-1` to the list `resultats`. Since `resultats` was previously defined based on the conditions involving `total_points` and `egalites`, appending `-1` does not change the initial conditions related to `total_points`, `egalites`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `total_matchs`. The only change is that `resultats` now contains the value `-1`.
