Output State: **`i` is 0, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and the values of `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `curr` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, and `curr`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
