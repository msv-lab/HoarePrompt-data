Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `idx` is 2 * n + 3, `data` is a list of values, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 2]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1, and the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` is true.**
