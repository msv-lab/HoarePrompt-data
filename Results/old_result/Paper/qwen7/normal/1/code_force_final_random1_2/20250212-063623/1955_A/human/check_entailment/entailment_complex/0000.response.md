Reasoning:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates `t` times, which matches the number of test cases. This ensures that each test case is processed correctly.
2. **Input Parsing**: Inside the loop, the input is parsed into `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`, which correctly handles the input format specified in the problem statement.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition checks if the promotional price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than the regular price for two yogurts (`2*B`). If true, it means buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying them individually.
   - The second condition checks if the total number of yogurts (`A`) is even. If true, it means Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs, thus minimizing the cost.
   - The third condition handles the case where the total number of yogurts is odd. It calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price.
4. **Output**: The code prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirements.
5. **Edge Cases**: The logic covers various scenarios, including when the promotional price is better, when the number of yogurts is even, and when the number of yogurts is odd.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
