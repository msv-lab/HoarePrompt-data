Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are more values in `b_values` for `i` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is one of the values in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` is 0 (this variable is not directly part of the loop head but might be affected by the loop body).

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the values in `b_values`, and `i` is one of those values, we need to ensure that `b_values` still has valid values for `i` to iterate over.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was one of the values in `b_values`, so for the loop to continue, `b_values` must still contain `i`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` remains one of the values in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` is not directly modified by the loop head, so its value remains 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is one of the values in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**
