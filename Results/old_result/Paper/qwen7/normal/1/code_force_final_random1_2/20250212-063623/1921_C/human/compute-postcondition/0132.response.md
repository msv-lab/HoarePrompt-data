Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2 (if it was 1, otherwise 3), `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `array2` is a list. If `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `arr[0] * feat[2]`. Otherwise, `array2` contains the element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. If neither condition is met, `array2` remains unchanged.
