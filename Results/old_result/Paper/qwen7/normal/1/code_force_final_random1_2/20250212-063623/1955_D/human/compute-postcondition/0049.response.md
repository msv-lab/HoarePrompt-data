Output State: **`i` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `m - 1` to `m - 2`. The other variables (`n` and `cnt_b[a[i]]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
