Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. The only variable involved here is the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split on spaces and converted to integers
   - `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1
   - `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer
   - This holds whether the condition `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2)` is true or false.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations must be decremented by 1. Therefore, the number of iterations should be reduced by 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop head involves `int(input())`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations. The other states (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `num`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split on spaces and converted to integers, `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1, `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer**.

Since the number of iterations is reduced by 1, the loop will continue as long as the remaining number of iterations is positive.
