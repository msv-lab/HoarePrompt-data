Postcondition: **`queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that is not in `visited`, and `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`.**

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the else part does not change the state of the variables, and the if part does not have any additional changes to report beyond what is already stated in the precondition.
