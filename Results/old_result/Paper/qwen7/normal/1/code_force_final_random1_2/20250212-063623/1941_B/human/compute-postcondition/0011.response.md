Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will iterate based on the integer value read from the input.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input integer (let's call it `num`) is greater than 0. Each iteration of the loop reads a new integer from the input.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: After each iteration, the state of the loop head variables (`num`) will change. Specifically, `num` will be decremented by 1 after each iteration until it becomes 0, at which point the loop will terminate.

4. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**: The postcondition given is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The conditions on `b` are specified.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be that `num` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` remains the same (since `t` is not involved in the loop head).
- `a` remains the same (since `a` is not involved in the loop head).
- `b` remains the same (since `b` is not involved in the loop head).
- `num` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1**.
