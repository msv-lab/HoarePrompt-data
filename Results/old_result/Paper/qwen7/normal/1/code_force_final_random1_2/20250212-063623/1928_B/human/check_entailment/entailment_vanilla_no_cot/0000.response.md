Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code defines several functions using `func_1` to `func_9`, but it does not actually implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation to the array. However, none of the defined functions address this requirement. 

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:

1. Read the input for the number of test cases and process each test case.
2. For each test case, read the array and sort it.
3. Use a permutation to maximize the frequency of a single number in the array.
4. Output the maximum frequency of any number in the transformed array.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def solve(test_case):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Sort the array
    arr.sort()
    
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_freq = max(freq.values())
    
    # Check if we can achieve a higher frequency by shifting
    for key in freq:
        if key + 1 in freq:
            if freq[key] + freq[key + 1] > max_freq:
                max_freq = freq[key] + freq[key + 1]
    
    print(max_freq)

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    solve()
```

This solution reads the input, sorts the array, and then uses a counter to find the maximum frequency of any number. It also checks if combining frequencies of consecutive numbers can yield a higher frequency.
