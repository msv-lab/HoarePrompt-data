Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from another input string split and converted to integers.

The `print` statement checks the result of `func_1(a, x, k)` and prints `'YES'` if the function returns `True`, otherwise it prints `'NO'`.

However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact outcome of `func_1(a, x, k)`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's return value.

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, otherwise 'NO'**
