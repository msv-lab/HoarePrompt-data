Output State: **`start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing 0 and 1; `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start]` by 1. Given that `start` is 1, it modifies `nums[1]` by subtracting 1 from its current value. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
