Output State: **`zero` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 100 or 50, `i` is 4, `one_perc` is -400, `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4, `n` must be greater than 4**.

Explanation: The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. Since `zero` was either 1 or 2, after incrementing, it becomes either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
