Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is updated to be a sorted list of unique integers in descending order followed by 0.**

Explanation:
1. The input is split and converted to integers, then made unique using `set()`.
2. The resulting set is converted back to a list and sorted in descending order.
3. A 0 is appended to the end of the list.
4. The variable `arr` is updated to reflect these changes.

All other variables (`tc`, `n`, `dp`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
