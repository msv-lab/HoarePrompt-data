Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values and conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `t` is the first integer from input.
   - `v` is the second integer from input.
   - `num` is a list containing the second integer from input (`v`).
   - If `t` does not equal 2, `start` remains unchanged; if `t` equals 2, `end` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, it will increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` is not specified to change within the loop, so `n` remains the same.
   - The values of `t`, `v`, `num`, `start`, and `end` do not change based on the loop itself but depend on external conditions (input and initial conditions).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `t`, `v`, `num`, `start`, and `end` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from input, `v` is the second integer from input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from input, and if `t` does not equal 2, `start` remains unchanged; if `t` equals 2, `end` remains unchanged.**
