Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Duration:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid by processing the string `s` in two directions (left-to-right and right-to-left) and storing intermediate results in `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B`.
   - However, the logic for calculating the time to leave the grid is flawed. The current implementation does not accurately reflect the movement of the pinball based on the rules provided.

2. **Misinterpretation of Pinball Movement:**
   - The pinball moves based on the direction indicated by the character at its current position. If the character is '>', the pinball moves right, and if it is '<', the pinball moves left.
   - The pinball also inverts the direction at each step, but the current implementation does not correctly simulate this behavior.

3. **Incorrect Use of Indices and Values:**
   - The variables `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are used in a way that does not align with the intended logic. For example, the calculation of `x` in the loops does not correctly represent the time taken for the pinball to move to the boundary of the grid.

4. **Lack of Proper Simulation:**
   - The program does not properly simulate the movement of the pinball for each query. Instead, it tries to precompute some values and then use them to derive the final result, which is not accurate.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
