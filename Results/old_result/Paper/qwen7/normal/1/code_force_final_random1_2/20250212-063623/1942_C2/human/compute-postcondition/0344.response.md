Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `gap` as it iterates over the `even` iterable.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `even` is a non-empty iterable.
   - `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`.
   - `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - The loop takes each value from the `even` iterable and assigns it to `gap`.
   - `ans` is updated by adding the current value of `gap`.
   - `y` is updated by subtracting `gap // 2`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `even`, the next value of `gap` will be the next element in the `even` iterable.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `gap`.
   - `y` will be updated based on the new value of `gap`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `even` remains a non-empty iterable (since it is still being iterated over).
   - `ans` will be increased by the next value of `gap`.
   - `y` will be decreased by the next value of `gap // 2`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`even` is a non-empty iterable, `ans` is increased by the next value of `gap`, `y` is decreased by the next value of `gap // 2`**
