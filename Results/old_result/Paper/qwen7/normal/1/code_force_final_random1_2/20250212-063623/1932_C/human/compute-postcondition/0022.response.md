Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with one additional element from `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[r])` appends the element `a[r]` to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide the exact values or definitions of `a` and `r`, so we can only say that `b` now contains one more element than before, which is `a[r]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
