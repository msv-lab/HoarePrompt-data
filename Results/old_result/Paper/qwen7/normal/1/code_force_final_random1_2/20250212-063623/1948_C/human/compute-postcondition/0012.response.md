Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n, 2)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 until it is no longer less than `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is an index such that `i + 1 < n`.
   - Either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 2` must still satisfy `i + 1 < n`.
   - The condition `n > 1` remains unchanged as long as `n` does not change.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The condition `i + 1 < n` needs to hold true for the next iteration.
   - The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` might or might not hold true depending on the values of `a` and `b` at the next `i`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so if the current `i` is `i`, the next `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - The condition `i + 1 < n` must still hold true.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `i` becomes `i + 2`.
- The condition `i + 1 < n` must still hold true.
- The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` might or might not hold true depending on the values of `a` and `b` at the next `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is an index such that `i + 2 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`**.
