Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `feat` by taking user input and splitting it by spaces. Each element in the input is converted to an integer. The values of `test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
