Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` which is being unpacked from each inner list in `cas_de_test`.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each inner list in `cas_de_test`.
   - Each inner list contains three integers `[p1, p2, p3]` which are sorted non-decreasingly (0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30).

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `cas_de_test` is a list of lists, and each inner list contains `[p1, p2, p3]`, we need to ensure that `cas_de_test` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` within each inner list should satisfy the condition 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30.

4. **Consider the initial state**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `[p1, p2, p3]` representing the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.
   - `resultats` is an empty list.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `cas_de_test` is not empty.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`cas_de_test` must not be an empty list**
