Output State: **`x` must be greater than 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` now contains the value of `a` appended to a list, `lst[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to the list `lst[a]`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `rev[b]` is updated to contain `a` appended to its list.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list stored in `rev[b]`. Since `a` and `b` are input integers, their values remain unchanged. The list `rev[b]` is updated to include `a` as its last element. The conditions and values of other variables remain the same as the initial state.
