Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `n` is equal to `feat[0]`, `i` is `feat[0] + (n - 1) + 1` to ensure it is less than `test_cases`, `f` is equal to `feat[1]`, `a` is equal to `feat[2]`, `b` is equal to `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `array2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `array2`. The values of the other variables (`feat`, `n`, `i`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
