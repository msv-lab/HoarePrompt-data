Output State: `i` is `n - m - 1`; `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`; `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `curr` is `0`; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key from `0` to `n - m - 1` (inclusive) has a value of `0`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` has reached `n - m - 1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than `2 * m - 1`. The variable `ans` holds the cumulative count of instances where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` throughout the loop's execution. The variable `curr` is reset to `0` after the last iteration. The dictionary `cnt_b` has been updated for each value of `i` from `0` to `n - m - 1`, setting each corresponding entry to `0`.
