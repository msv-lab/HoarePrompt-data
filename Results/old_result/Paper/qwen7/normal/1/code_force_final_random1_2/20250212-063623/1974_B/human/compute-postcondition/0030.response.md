Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a new string where each character in `s` that exists in `unique_chars` is replaced by the corresponding character from `unique_chars` based on its last occurrence index, and characters not in `unique_chars` are inserted into `unique_chars` at their correct positions with `j` being set to the length of `unique_chars`.**
