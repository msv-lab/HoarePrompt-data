Output State: **`k` is a list that contains the count of '1's from each input string `b` that contained '1'. If an input string `b` did not contain '1', it is not included in the list `k`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `k` will contain the counts of '1's from all the input strings `b` that had at least one '1'. Strings `b` that did not contain the character '1' will not be included in the list `k`.
