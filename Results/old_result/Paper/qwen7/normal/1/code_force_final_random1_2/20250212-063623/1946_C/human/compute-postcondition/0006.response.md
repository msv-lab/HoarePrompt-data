Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), and `num_iterations` is \(t - 1\).

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive of 1 but exclusive of \(10^4\)), and the variable `num_iterations` will hold the value \(t - 1\). This means that the loop has executed exactly \(t - 1\) times.
