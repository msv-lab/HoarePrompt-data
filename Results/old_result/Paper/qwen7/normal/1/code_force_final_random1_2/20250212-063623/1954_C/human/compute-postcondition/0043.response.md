Output State: **`i` is `len(a) + 1`, `b` is a list of integers created from the input string**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, list(input())))` takes an input string, converts it into a list of characters, and then maps each character to an integer. This results in `b` being a list of integers derived from the input string. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `len(a) + 1`, where `a` is a list of integers created from another input string.
