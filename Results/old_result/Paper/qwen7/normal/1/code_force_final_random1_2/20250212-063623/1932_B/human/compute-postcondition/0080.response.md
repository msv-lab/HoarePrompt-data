Output State: **`ai` is the last element of `a`, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one, `a` remains the same, `n` remains the same.**

The code `results.append(current_year)` appends the current value of `current_year` (which is now equal to `next_year`) to the list `results`. The values of `ai`, `a`, `n`, and the previous `current_year` values in `results` remain unchanged.
