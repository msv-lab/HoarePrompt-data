Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 6 (4 * q + 2), `results` is a list of length q + 1 with one additional element 'YES', `l` is now an integer value from `data` at the index `idx`, `r` is an integer value from `data` at the index `idx + 1`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` and `v2` will be updated based on the new `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `it2` will be recalculated based on the new `v2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `idx` is increased by 6 (which is 4 * q + 2), `l` is set to the value of `data` at the new index `idx`, and `r` is set to the value of `data` at the next index `idx + 1`. The value of `x` is calculated as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. Variables `v1`, `v2`, and `it2` will be updated based on the new values of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
