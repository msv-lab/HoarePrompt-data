Output State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the original input, the second element is the new input from the append operation, and the third element is the new input, `i` is 2, `ans` is 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the result of `input()` to the list `gr`. Since `gr` originally contained two elements (the first element being the original input and the second being the new input from an append operation), after appending the new input, `gr` now contains three elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
