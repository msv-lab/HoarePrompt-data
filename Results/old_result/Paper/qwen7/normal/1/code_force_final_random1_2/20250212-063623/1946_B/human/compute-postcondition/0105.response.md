Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `sm` is either equal to `suf[i] - smin[i]` if the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111` is true, or `sm` remains unchanged (equal to -111) if the condition is false.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts from `0` and goes up to `n`. Since `i` is currently `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `n`.
2. **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop. Therefore, it remains the same.
3. **Variable `sm`**: The value of `sm` depends on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111`. This condition is evaluated based on the current values of `i`, `suf`, and `smin`. Since `i` changes to `n` in the next iteration, the value of `sm` might change depending on the new value of `suf[n] - smin[n]`.

### Adjusting the States
- **`i`**: It will be incremented by 1 from `n-1` to `n`.
- **`sm`**: Its value will depend on the condition `suf[n] - smin[n] > sm or sm == -111`. However, since we don't know the exact value of `suf[n] - smin[n]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `sm` without knowing these values. But we can say that `sm` will be updated based on the condition.

### Final State
Given the above analysis, the final state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `n`
- `n` remains the same
- `sm` will be updated based on the condition `suf[n] - smin[n] > sm or sm == -111`

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `sm` is either equal to `suf[n] - smin[n]` if the condition `suf[n] - smin[n] > sm or sm == -111` is true, or `sm` remains unchanged (equal to -111) if the condition is false**.
