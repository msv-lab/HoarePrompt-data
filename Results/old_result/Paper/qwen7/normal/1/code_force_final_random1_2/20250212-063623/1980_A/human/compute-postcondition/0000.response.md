Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', and a function is defined to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.**

The provided code snippet does not modify any of the variables or perform any operations that would change their values. It only defines a docstring for a function that calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create based on the given parameters. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
