Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l`. If the first element of `lis` is not 1 or the length of `lis` is 1, the postcondition remains as the precondition. Otherwise, `lis` has at least 2 elements, `test` is definitively False, and `j` is the total number of elements in `lis`.
