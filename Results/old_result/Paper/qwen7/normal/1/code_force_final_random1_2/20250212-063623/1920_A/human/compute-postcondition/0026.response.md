Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` is 3
   - The condition `t == 3` is met, so the function does nothing and the values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop iterates over the range defined by `n`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i` (the loop will iterate as long as `i < n`), we need to determine the value of `n` such that the loop can execute at least once.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
