Postcondition: `i` must be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is equal to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains less than `n`, `n` remains greater than 0, the character at position `i` in string `s` is '>', `l` remains less than `r`, `a` remains equal to the element at index `l` in array `A`, `x` is non-negative, and `b` is calculated as `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.
