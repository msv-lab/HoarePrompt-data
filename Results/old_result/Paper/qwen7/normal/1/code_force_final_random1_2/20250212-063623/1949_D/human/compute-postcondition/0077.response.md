Output State: **`x` is a list of strings, the value of `x[j-1]` is 'F', and `a[i]` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. The value of `x[j-1]` remains 'F' as no operation was performed on it. All other elements of `x` retain their original values as no operation was performed on them.
