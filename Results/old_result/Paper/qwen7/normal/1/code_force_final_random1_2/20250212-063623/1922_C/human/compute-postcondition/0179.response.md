Output State: **`d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` must be at least 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. The value of `i` remains `n - 4`, and `n` must be at least 3, which means the condition for the list indices to be valid is still met.
