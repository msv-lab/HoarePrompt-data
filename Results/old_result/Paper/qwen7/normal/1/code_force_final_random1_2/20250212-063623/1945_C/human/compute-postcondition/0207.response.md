Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 3 or 2 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is now `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one` is undefined, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is either greater than or equal to 50 or a specific value, `lst` contains 2, 3, `one_perc` remains undefined.**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. This updates the list `lst` from `[2, 2]` to `[2, 2, 3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
