Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input split from the input string, `b` is the second integer input split from the input string**.

Explanation: The code splits the input string into two integers and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since the initial value of `t` is the integer input that matches the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains unchanged. The input string is split into two parts, and these parts are converted to integers and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.
