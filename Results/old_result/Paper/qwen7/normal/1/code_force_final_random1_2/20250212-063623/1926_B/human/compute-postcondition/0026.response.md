Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is in the range of `a`.
   - There are no other variables mentioned in the loop head.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - The postcondition mentions `k` which is a list containing counts of '1's from each input string `b` that contained '1'.
   - The loop does not directly affect `k` or `a`, but it increments `i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < a`, so `i` must be less than `a` for the loop to execute again.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is incremented by 1 and the loop condition remains valid.

**State:**
- `k` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `a` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`k` is a list that contains the count of '1's from each input string `b` that contained '1', `i` is `i + 1`, `a` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
