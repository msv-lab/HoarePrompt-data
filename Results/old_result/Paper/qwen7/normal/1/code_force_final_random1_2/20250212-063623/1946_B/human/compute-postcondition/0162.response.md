Output State: **`sm` is -111, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and `smin` is a list containing `n+1` elements. Each element in `smin` will be the minimum cumulative sum encountered so far during the iterations. Specifically, `smin[i]` will be the minimum of `suf[i+1]` and `smin[i-1]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, with `smin[n]` being the final cumulative sum `suf[n]`.**

In this state, the variable `sm` is explicitly set to -111. The variables `i`, `n`, and `smin` retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state, with `i` now updated to `n-1` since the loop has completed all its iterations.
