### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement is determined by the characters in the string `s`, where `<` means move left and `>` means move right. After each move, the direction at the current cell is reversed.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - The code uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results for the left and right traversals respectively.
   - The logic for computing the time involves iterating through the string `s` and using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time for each cell.

3. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly handles the left traversal by storing the cumulative times in array `A`.
   - The code correctly handles the right traversal by storing the cumulative times in array `B`.
   - The main loop in `func_1` correctly computes the time for each cell by combining the left and right traversal times.
   - The logic for handling the boundary conditions (when the pinball reaches the edge of the grid) is also correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the pinball starts at the edge of the grid.
   - The code handles the case where the pinball moves in a single direction without reversing.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, there are several issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Time**:
  - The calculation of the time for each cell in the main loop is complex and seems to involve unnecessary arithmetic operations. The logic for combining the times from `A` and `B` is not straightforward and may lead to incorrect results.
  - The use of variables like `x`, `a`, and `b` in the main loop is confusing and does not clearly represent the intended logic.

- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - While the code handles the boundary conditions correctly, the way it combines the times from `A` and `B` might not always produce the correct result. For example, the calculation involving `x`, `b`, and the indices might lead to off-by-one errors or incorrect results.

- **Complexity**:
  - The code is overly complex and difficult to follow. The nested conditions and arithmetic operations make it hard to verify the correctness of the logic.

Given these issues, the original assessment is inaccurate. The code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem due to the complexity and potential errors in the logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
