Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( 2n \) integers. It then sorts the list and calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.**
