Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]`, `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[i + 1]`, and `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends `i` to the list associated with `pf[i]` in `mp`.**

Explanation: The code appends the index `i` to the list associated with `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
