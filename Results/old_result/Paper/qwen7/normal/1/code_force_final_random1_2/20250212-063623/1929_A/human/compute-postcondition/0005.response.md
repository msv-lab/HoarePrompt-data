Given the initial state:
- `ntest` is an input integer.
- `itest` must be between 0 and `ntest`-1 inclusive, and `itest` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input split.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input split. This means `a` contains integers from the input split, and it is sorted.
2. `a[len(a) - 1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`.
3. `a[0]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.
4. The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the last and the first elements of the list `a`.

Since the exact values of the integers in the list `a` are not specified, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the list.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`**
