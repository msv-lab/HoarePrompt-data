The function accepts three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `a` representing the health of the monsters, a list of integers `x` representing the initial positions of the monsters, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. It returns `True` if it can defeat all monsters given the conditions, otherwise it returns `False`. The function processes the monsters based on their positions, firing bullets to reduce their health until all monsters' health is depleted. If all monsters' health can be reduced to zero using the given number of bullets, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
