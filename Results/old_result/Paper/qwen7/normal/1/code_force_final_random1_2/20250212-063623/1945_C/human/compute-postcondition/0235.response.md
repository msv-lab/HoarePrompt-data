Output State: **`mini` is 10, `ele` is 20, `lst` is [15, 20], `final` is an empty list, `pk` is 25, `elem` is 20, `c1` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c1 = o * 100 // n` contains variables `o` and `n`, which are not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the operation cannot be performed, and `c1` remains undefined. All other variables retain their initial values.
