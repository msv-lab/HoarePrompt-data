Output State: **`count` is 4; `countmins` is 3; `g` is an integer value equal to `n // 4` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `count`, `countmins`, or `g`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no other operations are performed on these variables, their values remain unchanged.
