Output State: All values in `cnt_b` are 0, `curr` is 0, `ans` retains the value it had after the last iteration of the loop, and `n` and `m` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the dictionary `cnt_b` will have been reset for each element in `b_values`, making all its values 0. The variable `curr` will be reset to 0 after the last iteration. The variable `ans` will retain the value it had after the last iteration of the loop, as no further changes are specified for `ans` beyond what was described for the first three iterations. The variables `n` and `m` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, as they are not modified within the loop.
