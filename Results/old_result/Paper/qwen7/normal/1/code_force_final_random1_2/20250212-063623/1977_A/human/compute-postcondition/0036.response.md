Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, and `n` is not equal to `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` remains greater than `n`. If `m` is not greater than `n`, then `m` is either equal to `n` (with at least one of them being even) or equal to `n - 1`.
