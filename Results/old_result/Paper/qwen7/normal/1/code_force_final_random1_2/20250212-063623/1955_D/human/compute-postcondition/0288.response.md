Postcondition: `ans` remains 1, `curr` either increments by 1 or stays the same depending on whether the element `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` remains greater than or equal to `k` minus 1. The dictionary `cnt_b` updates the count of `a[i + m]` in `a` based on the condition, and `a[i + m]` is confirmed to be in `b_values`. If the condition `curr >= k` is true, then `ans` becomes 2.
