Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `zero` is either 1 or 2.
   - `zero_perc` is 100 or 50.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `one_perc` is -400.
   - `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `n - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `n - 1` must be greater than 3, which implies `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `zero` and `zero_perc` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - `i` increases by 1, so it becomes 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is 100 or 50, `i` is 4, `one_perc` is -400, `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
