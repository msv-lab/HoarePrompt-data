Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
   - `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.
   - If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the postcondition remains as initially described. Otherwise, `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`, or at least one of `a` or `b` is 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.
   - `mn` remains the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.**
