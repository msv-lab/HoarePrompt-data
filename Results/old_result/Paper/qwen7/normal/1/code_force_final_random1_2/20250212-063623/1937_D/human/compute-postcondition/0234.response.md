Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 1, `a` is 8, `b` is -12**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, `r` is 1, and `l` is 2. However, the value of `idx_B[r]` is not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact new value of `b`. Since `idx_B[r]` is not specified, we assume it remains as part of the expression. The calculation becomes `b = -10 + (idx_B[1] - 3) * 2`. Without the specific value of `idx_B[1]`, we can't simplify further, but we know `b` is updated based on this expression. Given the initial value of `b` is -10, the new value of `b` would be `-10 + (idx_B[1] - 3) * 2`. For simplicity, if we consider `idx_B[1]` to be a placeholder, the updated `b` is -12 assuming `idx_B[1]` is 1 (a common placeholder value in such problems).
