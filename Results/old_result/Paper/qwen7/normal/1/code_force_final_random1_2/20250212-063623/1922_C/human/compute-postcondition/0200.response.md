Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < m`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `j` is 1
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `x` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `y` is an integer obtained from splitting the input and converting it to an integer (this variable is not part of the loop head)

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but based on the given information, `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
