Output State: `tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`, and `j` equals `m-1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have been incremented in each iteration until it reaches `m-1`. The loop checks the condition `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` for each value of `j` from 0 to `m-2`. Since the loop has run for 3 times and we know it continues until `j` reaches `m-1`, it means that the condition inside the loop was found to be `True` for at least one value of `j` in each of the iterations. Therefore, `impossible` is set to `False`. All other variables remain in their initial or updated states as described in the loop's execution.
