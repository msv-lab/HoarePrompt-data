Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` must still be less than `len(a)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. The value of `new[i]` remains unchanged as it was previously assigned to `min(a[i], b[i])`. The condition that `i` must be less than `len(a)` still holds true.
