Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points` // 2, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, and `resultats` does not change if `total_points` is even, otherwise `resultats` contains -1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_matchs` as half of `total_points` using integer division (`//`). The value of `total_points` remains unchanged as it is only used in the calculation of `total_matchs`. The condition for `resultats` (whether it contains -1 or not) is based on the parity of `total_points`, which is not affected by the execution of this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `total_matchs` and the unchanged status of `resultats`.
