Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an input consisting of n lines, each containing n characters representing a partial transition video plan. The characters can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video). The function ensures that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided (i.e., at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters are F or S). Based on this input, the function determines the feasibility of the plan according to the given constraints.**

This functionality describes a function that takes no explicit parameters but processes an input structured as described, ensuring the constraints on the number of decided transition videos are met.
