Postcondition: **`aOnes` is 1 if `i` is found in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `aOnes` is 0. `bOnes` is either 0 or incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `b` up to `newk`. `i` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` is now a list of integers from the input, `b` is now a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `k` is at least 1.**

This means that if `i` is found in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` will be set to 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` will remain 0. The value of `bOnes` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `b` up to `newk`. All other variables and conditions remain as specified in the precondition.
