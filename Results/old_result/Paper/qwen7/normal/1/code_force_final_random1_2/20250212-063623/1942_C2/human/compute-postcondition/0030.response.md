Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` after the previous iteration plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `a` is the list `a` with its original values, `i` is the value of `i` after the previous iteration incremented by 1, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its previous value. The list `a` and the variable `i` have been incremented by 1, and `tmp` still contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.
