Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the array and compute the MEX.
   - The function uses a counter (`nums`) to count occurrences of each number in the array.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited numbers.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program enters a loop where it checks if `start` is present in the array.
   - If `start` is present, it marks it as visited and decrements its count.
   - If `start + 1` is also present, it processes `start + 1` instead.
   - If neither `start` nor `start + 1` is present, it prints `start + 1` and returns.

### Correctness Check

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Alice always picks elements from the array and adds them to her list `c`, then removes them from `a`.
   - Bob only removes elements from `a`.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should try to maximize the MEX, while Bob tries to minimize it.
   - The key insight is that Alice can ensure that the smallest missing number is maximized by ensuring that small numbers are added to `c` before larger ones.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the smallest number that is missing from the array.
   - However, it does not simulate the game properly. It simply finds the smallest number that is not present in the array, which is not equivalent to finding the MEX of the sequence `c`.

### Example Verification

Consider the example given:
- Test Case 1: `n = 4`, `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
- Expected Output: `2`

The correct sequence of moves would be:
1. Alice picks 1, `c = [1]`, `a = [0, 0, 1]`.
2. Bob picks 0, `a = [0, 1]`.
3. Alice picks 0, `c = [1, 0]`, `a = [1]`.
4. Bob picks 1, `a = []`.

Final `c = [1, 0]`, MEX = 2.

However, the provided code does not simulate the game correctly. It simply finds the smallest missing number in the array, which is not the same as the MEX of the sequence `c`.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly simulate the game and does not compute the MEX of the sequence `c` as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
