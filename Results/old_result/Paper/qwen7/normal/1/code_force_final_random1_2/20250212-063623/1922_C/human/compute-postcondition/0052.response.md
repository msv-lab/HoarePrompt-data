Given the initial state:
- `j` is 0
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `y` is less than or equal to `x`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` and `y` are input integers with the condition that `y <= x`.
- `d2` is a list or dictionary, but its contents are not specified in the initial state.

Since the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not explicitly given, we can only describe them in terms of their indices in the `d2` structure.

The print statement will output the difference between the `y`-th element and the `x`-th element of `d2`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
