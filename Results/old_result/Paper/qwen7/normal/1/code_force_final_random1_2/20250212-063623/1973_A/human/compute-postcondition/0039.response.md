Postcondition: `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is calculated based on `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`; if `total_points % 2 != 0`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`. If `total_points % 2 == 0`, `resultats` is either `[-1]` if `egalites < 0`, or a list containing `egalites // 2` if `egalites >= 0`.
