Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), `m` is \(15 * z - y * 4\), `x` is updated to the first integer entered, `y` is updated to the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `z`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
