Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a `defaultdict` with the default factory set to `int`. This means `d2` can hold integer values by default when accessed with a key that hasn't been set before. The values of `n`, `l`, and `d1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
