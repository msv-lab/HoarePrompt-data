`x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 4, `n` is at least 21, `m` is at least 7, `y` is 8, and `cnt` is 24.
Output State: **`x` is 4, `n` is at least 21, `m` is at least 7, `y` is 8, and `cnt` is 24.**
