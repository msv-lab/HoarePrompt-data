Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is the input string entered by the user.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from the input string `s`.
- `b` is a sorted string of the input string `s`.
- `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.
- `a` is now a set of unique characters from the input string `s`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
