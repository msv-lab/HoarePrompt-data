Postcondition: `num` must have at least one element, and `i` will iterate over each element in `num`. If the current value of `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If the current value of `i` is within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive, then `count_num` is incremented by 1.
