Output State: The list `suf` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `l` up to each index. Specifically, `suf[i]` will represent the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `suf` will be a list where each element (except the first one) is the sum of all elements in the list `l` up to that index. The length of `suf` will be equal to the length of `l`.
