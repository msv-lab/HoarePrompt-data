Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is given as a positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\) and both \(n\) and \(m\) are odd.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since \(n\) is an odd positive integer between 3 and 99, it will always be at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` should be 0, as the loop starts iterating from 0 up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `n` is within the specified range and is an odd positive integer.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99**
