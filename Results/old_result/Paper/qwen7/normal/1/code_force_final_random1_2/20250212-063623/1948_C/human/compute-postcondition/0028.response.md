Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer and must be at least 3.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
- The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<'.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Since no other variables or objects are being evaluated or modified within the provided code snippet, the output will be exactly as stated in the `print` statement.

Output: **No**
