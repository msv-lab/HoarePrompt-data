Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `idx_B = []` initializes `idx_B` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, or `B`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
