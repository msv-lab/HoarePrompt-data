Output State: **`d1[i + 2]` is 1 + `d1[i + 1]`, `i` is `current_i + 3`, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` is assigned the value `1 + d1[i + 1]`. The variable `i` is set to `current_i + 3`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
