Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means the loop will run based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are the placeholder `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

3. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 3
   - `res` is an input string
   - If `res` equals `<`, then `best` is 3

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since the loop head does not involve `i`, `n`, or `res`, these states remain unchanged.
   - The only thing that changes is the condition for the loop to continue, which is determined by `int(input())`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` remains 3
   - `n` remains greater than 3
   - `res` remains an input string
   - The loop will continue if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `res` is an input string, and the loop will continue if `int(input())` is greater than 0**.
