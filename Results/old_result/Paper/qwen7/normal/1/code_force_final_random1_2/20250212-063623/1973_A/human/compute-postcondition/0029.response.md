Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `egalites` using the formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This updates the value of `egalites` without affecting the values of `total_matchs`, `total_points`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Additionally, since the condition `p3 > total_matchs` was not met (otherwise `egalites` would be set differently), we keep the condition that `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`.
