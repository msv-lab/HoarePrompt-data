Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `j` is 0; `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b`; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in `l`. The other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.
