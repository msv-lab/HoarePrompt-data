Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to simulate a movement on the field. It takes a coordinate `(x, y)` and a direction `(dx, dy)` and returns the new coordinate.
   - The implementation of `func_1` is correct. It simply adds the direction values to the current coordinates and returns the new coordinates as a tuple.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program correctly handles the initialization of the field, players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - The program processes each move step-by-step, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle accordingly.
   - The program correctly handles player elimination when a player and a Bludger are in the same position.
   - The program correctly updates the score when a player successfully scores a goal.
   - The program prints the correct events in the correct order, including player eliminations and scoring events.
   - The final score is correctly printed at the end of the game.

3. **Edge Cases and Validations**:
   - The program ensures that the movements are within the bounds of the field.
   - The program correctly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
   - The program correctly handles the elimination of players and updates the Quaffle's position accordingly.
   - The program correctly handles the scoring events and updates the score.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
