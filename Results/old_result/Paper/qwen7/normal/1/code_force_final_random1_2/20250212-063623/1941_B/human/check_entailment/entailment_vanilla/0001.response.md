Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`
     2. `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`
   - If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Operation Description**:
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and performing the following assignments:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - This operation decreases the sum of the array by exactly 3.

4. **Analysis of Conditions**:
   - The conditions check if the first and last elements of the array have specific parity (odd/even) and value relationships with their adjacent elements.
   - Specifically:
     - `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`: This condition checks if the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2.
     - `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`: This condition checks if the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions without considering the entire array.
   - The program does not account for the possibility of making all elements zero through the described operations.
   - The conditions provided do not cover all scenarios where the array can be made zero.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The conditions provided are insufficient to cover all cases.

**Correctness: False**
