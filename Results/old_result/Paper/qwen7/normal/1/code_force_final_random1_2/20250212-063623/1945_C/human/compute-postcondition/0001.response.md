Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of times the loop should run.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input from the user. The value of `t` must be within the range [1, 2 * 10^4].

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, the initial state of `t` must be such that the loop can execute. Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range.

5. **State the Adjusted State**: The initial state before the loop starts should reflect that `t` is a valid integer input within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive**
