Output State: **`m` must be a positive integer; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `m` is a positive integer and its value does not change, it remains unchanged. The exact value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` depends on its previous state, but it is clear that it has been incremented by 1.
