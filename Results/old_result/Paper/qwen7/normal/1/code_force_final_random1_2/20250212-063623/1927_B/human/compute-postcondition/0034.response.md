Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `l`, `ans` is an empty list, `array` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.**

The code initializes `ans` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
