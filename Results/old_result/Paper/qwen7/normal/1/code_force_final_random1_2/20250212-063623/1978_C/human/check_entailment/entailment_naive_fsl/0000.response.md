Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation based on the given `n` and `k`, but it does not cover all possible scenarios, particularly when `k` is odd or when `n` is odd and `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for that `n`.

For example, consider the test case `(n, k) = (1, 1000000000000)`. Here, `n` is 1 and `k` is a very large number. Since the Manhattan value for a permutation of length 1 can only be 0, there is no valid permutation for this case. However, the program does not handle this edge case correctly and returns a permutation instead of indicating that no such permutation exists.

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where `k` is odd. The Manhattan value is always even because each term `|p_i - i|` contributes either 0 or an even number to the total sum. Therefore, if `k` is odd, no permutation can satisfy the condition, but the program does not account for this scenario.

To fix these issues, the program needs to check if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given `n` and return "No" in those cases.
