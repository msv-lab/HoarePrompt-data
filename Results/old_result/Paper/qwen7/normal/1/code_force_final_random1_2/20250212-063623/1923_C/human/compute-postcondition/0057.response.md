Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs an integer.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is driven by user input, the only thing that changes from one iteration to the next is the value of the loop variable `_`.
   - The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`) are not directly modified by the loop itself but rather by the loop body, which is omitted in the given code.

3. **Understand the loop body implications**: Although the loop body is not provided, we know that the loop increments `m` by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `m` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `m` will be incremented by 1.
   - `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged because the problem statement does not indicate any modification to these variables within the loop body.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `m` is incremented by 1.
- `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed plus 1, `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers entered through input, `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**
