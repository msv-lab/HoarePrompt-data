#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of the monsters, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. The length of a and x is n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. The values in x are sorted in strictly increasing order and are non-zero, and -n ≤ x[i] < x[i+1] ≤ n for all i.
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        
        rest = k
        
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        
        distance += 1
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in the list `a` that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0, `distance` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, `rest` is 0, and `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, every element in the list `a` that corresponds to indices in `sorted_indices` has been reduced to 0. This means all monsters' health has been depleted. The variable `distance` keeps track of how many times the loop has executed, which is equivalent to the length of `sorted_indices`. The variable `rest` is depleted to 0, indicating that all available bullets have been used up. Finally, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, meaning that all indices in `sorted_indices` have been processed.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `a` representing the health of the monsters, a list of integers `x` representing the initial positions of the monsters, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. It returns `True` if it can defeat all monsters given the conditions, otherwise it returns `False`. The function processes the monsters based on their positions, firing bullets to reduce their health until all monsters' health is depleted. If all monsters' health can be reduced to zero using the given number of bullets, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. x is a list of n integers where each integer x_i satisfies -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more inputs left to process. For each iteration, `n` will be the first integer from the input split by space, `k` will be the second integer from the input split by space, `a` will be a list of integers obtained from the input string, and `x` will be a list of integers obtained from another input string using map and split functions. The variable `t` will decrement by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads values for \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), list \( a \), and list \( x \). It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to determine if a certain condition is met. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends with the variable `t` set to 0, indicating that all inputs have been processed.
