Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(2, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
   - `res` is an input string (not part of the loop head).
   - `k` is 1 (not part of the loop head).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(2, n)` will execute as long as `n > 2` and `i` starts from 2 up to but not including `n`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 3, it satisfies the starting condition of the loop (`i = 2` is the first value in the range).
   - `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to start. Given that `n` is an input integer greater than 3, this condition is inherently satisfied.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 2, which is already given as an input integer greater than 3.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `res` is an input string, `k` is 1**
