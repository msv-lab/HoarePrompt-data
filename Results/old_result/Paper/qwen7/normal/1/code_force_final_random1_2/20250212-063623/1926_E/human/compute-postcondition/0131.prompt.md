You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        d = n
        
        h = n
        
        p = 1
        
        g = 0
        
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are inputs provided through `input()`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following will be true:
    #
    #- `t` will be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
    #- `n` and `k` will hold the last pair of integers read from the input.
    #- `s` will be equal to the total number of iterations `i`.
    #- `d` will be 0.
    #- `h` will be reduced to 0.
    #- `p` will be equal to `i`.
    #- `g` will be the sum of the series \(\left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + \ldots + 1\).
    #- `f` will be `k - g`.
    #- `y` will be \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times (k - g) - 1)\) if `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise it will be undefined.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `i` (which represents the total number of iterations) will determine the final values of `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `y`. The values of `n` and `k` will reflect the last input pair processed by the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is simply a count of the total number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within specific ranges (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. It returns a result based on the relationship between `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
