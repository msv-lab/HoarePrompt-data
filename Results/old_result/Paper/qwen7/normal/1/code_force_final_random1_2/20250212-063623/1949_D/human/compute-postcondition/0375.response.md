Output State: **`nx` is 'SF' or 'FS', `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by concatenating the character at index `j - 1` (which is `1`) of the list `xx[i]` to `nx`. Given that `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1. Since `nx` can initially be either 'S' or 'F', concatenating the character at index 1 of `xx[i]` (which is also 'F' or 'S') results in `nx` becoming either 'SF' or 'FS'. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2.
