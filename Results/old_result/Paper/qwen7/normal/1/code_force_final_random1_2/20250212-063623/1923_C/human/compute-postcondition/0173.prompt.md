Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [0]
    c = [0]
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if x == 1:
            j += 1
        i += x
        p.append(i)
        c.append(j)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
        s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `m` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed, `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers entered through input, `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no change is made to `s - (b - a + 1)`. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are integers representing the last pair of numbers entered through input. `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed. If during any iteration `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, no changes are made to `i` and `s`. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to `i` and `s` as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from the input for each iteration, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. The condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i)` must hold true for each iteration where `b - a + 1 > 1`. If the condition is not met for any iteration, `m` will decrease but cannot go below 1. Additionally, `p` and `c` are lists where `p[0]` is 0, followed by the cumulative sums of the list `l`, and `c[0]` is 0, followed by the cumulative counts of 1's in `l`.

This means that after all iterations, `m` will reflect the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` found that satisfy the given condition across all iterations, and the cumulative sums and counts will be updated accordingly based on the input values of `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
