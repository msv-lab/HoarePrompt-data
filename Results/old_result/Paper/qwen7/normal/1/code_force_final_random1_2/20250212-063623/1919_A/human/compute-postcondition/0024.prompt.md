You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the `winner` values from each iteration, the original `a` and `b` values from each iteration, and the `winner` is added to the list after each iteration until `t` becomes 0.
    #
    #In this final state, `t` has reached 0 after all iterations of the loop have completed, meaning all `t` input integers have been processed. The `results` list contains the `winner` value determined by `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers `(a, b)` entered by the user, along with the original values of `a` and `b` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing tuples for each iteration where each tuple includes the `winner`, the original values of `a` and `b`, and possibly other information.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. Based on these inputs, the function performs some operations and returns a result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
