Output State: **`ans` contains the element 2 ** `i`, `i` retains its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified, so `i` retains its previous value. The list `ans` now includes the element `2 ** i`.
