Output State: **`i` is 3; `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` becomes `a[3] - a[2]`. Since `ad` initially contains the value `a[1] - a[0]`, after executing the code, `ad` will contain both `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
