Based on the initial state described:

- `new` is a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- `i` is equal to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

This statement joins the elements of the `new` list into a single string, converting each element to a string before joining them together.

Since `new` contains the minimum of the corresponding elements from `a` and `b`, and `i = len(a)` means the loop has processed all elements, `new` must have the same length as `a` (and also `b`).

However, without the actual values of `a` and `b`, we cannot determine the exact content of `new`. But we know it will be a list of integers (or other comparable types), and the `print` statement will join these elements into a single string.

Therefore, the output will be a string composed of the elements of `new` concatenated together.

Output: **a string composed of the elements of `new` concatenated together**
