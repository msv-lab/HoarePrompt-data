Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (from `1` to `n+1`) for which `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. The list `sb` is a list containing the single integer `1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` will still just contain the number `1`.
