Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, the value of `A` remains unchanged. If `A` is odd, `i` becomes 0, `A` is set to half of the original value of `A`, and `B` and `C` retain their original values.
