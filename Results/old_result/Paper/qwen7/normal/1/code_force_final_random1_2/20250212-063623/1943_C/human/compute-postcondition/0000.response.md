Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` being an integer between 1 and 2000 is preserved, and now `n` holds the specific value input by the user. The list `u2vs` remains unchanged.
