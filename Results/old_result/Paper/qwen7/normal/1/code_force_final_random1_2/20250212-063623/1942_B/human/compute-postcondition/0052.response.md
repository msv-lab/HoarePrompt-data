Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `-1`.**

Explanation: The line `mex = n` updates the value of `mex` to be equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
