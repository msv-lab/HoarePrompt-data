Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is the value of `B[r - 1] - B[x]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `b - B[x]`. Given that `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, the updated value of `b` is now `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
