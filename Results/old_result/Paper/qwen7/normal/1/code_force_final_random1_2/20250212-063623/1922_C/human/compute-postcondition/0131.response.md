Given the initial state:
- `j` is 2
- `m` is an input integer
- `x` is an integer from the input split
- `y` is an integer from the input split

We need to determine the value of `d1[y] - d1[x]` and then print it.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the dictionary `d1`. Since `d1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the actual values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` when the code runs. 

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
