Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, and `n` is equal to `m`, and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, and if `m` and `n` are both odd, then they remain odd; otherwise, at least one of `m` or `n` is even.
