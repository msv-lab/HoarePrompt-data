Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`).

2. **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because the maximum beauty of the array is achieved when the largest possible difference between consecutive elements is maximized. Sorting ensures that the smallest and largest elements are at the ends of the array, maximizing the differences between them.

3. **Beauty Calculation**: The program calculates the beauty of the array as the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). This is correct because the beauty is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. By sorting, we ensure that the differences are maximized, and the sum of these differences is the maximum possible.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
