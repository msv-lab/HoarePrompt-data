Postcondition: `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is calculated based on `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`; if `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`; otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing `egalites // 2`.
