Output State: **`x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `p` is a list containing the value 2.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is appended with the value of `i`, which was previously increased by 1. Since `i` was initially increased by 1 (making it 2), `p` now contains the value 2. The values of `x` and `j` remain unchanged.
