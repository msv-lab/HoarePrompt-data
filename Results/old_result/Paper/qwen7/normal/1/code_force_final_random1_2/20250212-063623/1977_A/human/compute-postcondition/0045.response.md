Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `m` is an integer from the input.
- `i` is `k + 1`, where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `t` is the same as before.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since no specific values for `n`, `m`, `k`, or `t` are provided, and the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output will be the literal string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
