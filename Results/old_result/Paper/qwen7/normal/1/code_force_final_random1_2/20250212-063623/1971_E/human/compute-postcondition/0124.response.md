Output State: **`ql` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `l` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `ql`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `s`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
