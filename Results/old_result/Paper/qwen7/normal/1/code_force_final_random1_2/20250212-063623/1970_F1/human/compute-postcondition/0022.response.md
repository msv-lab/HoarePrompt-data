Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `i`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, and if `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.
