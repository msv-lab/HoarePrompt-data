The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero (i.e., `n != 0`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to a non-zero value.

State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 3], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3, `m` is 3, `n` must be non-zero**
