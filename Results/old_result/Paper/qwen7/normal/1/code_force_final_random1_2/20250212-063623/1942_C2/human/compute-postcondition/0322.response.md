Postcondition: `even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least two elements, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` is the next element from `odd`, `ans` is increased by the previous `gap` value, and `y` is decreased by half of `gap` if `y` is not less than half of `gap`. If `y` is less than half of `gap`, then `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
