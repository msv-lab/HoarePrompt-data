Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is 2.
   - `L` is a list containing the single element 2, i.e., `L = [2]`.
   - `pow` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))`.

3. **Identifying Variables and Their Values:**
   - We need to identify the values of `k` and `tot` to evaluate the expression inside the print statement. However, these variables are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since they are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values. 

4. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Given `pow` is 2, the expression becomes `2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since `k` and `tot` are not specified, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)**
