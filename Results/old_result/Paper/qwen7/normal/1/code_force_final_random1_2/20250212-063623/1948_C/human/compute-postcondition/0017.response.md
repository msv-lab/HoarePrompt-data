Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is an index such that `i + 4 < n`.
- Either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Since no other values are being referenced or computed, and the print statement directly outputs the string `'No'`, the output will be:

Output: **No**
