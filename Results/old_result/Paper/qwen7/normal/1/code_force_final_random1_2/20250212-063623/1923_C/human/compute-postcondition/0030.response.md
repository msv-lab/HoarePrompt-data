Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `l` is an empty list, `x` is not defined since the loop has completed, `i` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in the original list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l` for each iteration, `c` is a list containing the count of 1s encountered so far for each iteration.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `l` will be consumed (turned into an empty list), `i` will hold the total sum of all elements in `l`, `j` will hold the total count of 1s in `l`, `p` will contain a list where each element represents the cumulative sum of the elements seen up to that point in the loop, and `c` will contain a list where each element represents the cumulative count of 1s seen up to that point in the loop.
