Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, then the postcondition remains as `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l**.
