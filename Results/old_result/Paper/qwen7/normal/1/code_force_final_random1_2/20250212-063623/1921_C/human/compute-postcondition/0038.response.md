Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

3. **Initial values**:
   - `i` is initially set to `feat[0] + 1`.
   - `n` is initially set to `feat[0]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
   - `array2` is an empty list.
   - `feat` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `feat[0] + 1` and `n` is set to `feat[0]`, this means `i` will always be 1 more than `n` initially, making the loop condition `i < n` false.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the initial value of `n` such that `i` is less than `n`.

5. **Final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` (which is `feat[0] + 1`) is less than `n` (which should be adjusted to be greater than `feat[0] + 1`).

Given these considerations, the final state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` must be greater than `feat[0] + 1`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is an empty list, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input**.

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `n`:

State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` must be greater than `feat[0] + 1`**.
