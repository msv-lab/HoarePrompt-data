Output State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk` and is sorted, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0, `s` is the input string**.

Explanation: The code sets `pk` to `n / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `n` is divided by 2 to assign to `pk`. The other variables (`lst`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, and `s`) retain their initial states.
