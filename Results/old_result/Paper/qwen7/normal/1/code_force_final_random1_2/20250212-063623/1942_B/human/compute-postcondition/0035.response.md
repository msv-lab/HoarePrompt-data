Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means the loop starts at `i = len(ar) - 2` (as per the previous iteration) and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was `len(ar) - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, it will become `len(ar) - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjust Other States**: The other states (`n`, `mex`, `res`, `ar`) are not directly affected by the loop itself but might be indirectly modified within the loop body. However, since the problem does not specify any changes to these variables within the loop body, we assume they remain unchanged.

5. **Postcondition Check**: The postcondition for the loop body is that `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`. Since this condition is checked and potentially modifies `res[i]`, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` reflects the correct position in the list `res`.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, and if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.**
