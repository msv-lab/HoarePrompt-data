Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each value in `b_values`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be one of the values in `b_values`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is one of the values in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each value in `b_values`, the variable `i` will take the next value from `b_values`.
   - The variable `cnt_b[i]` will be incremented by 1 during the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume it remains 0 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will change to the next value in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` will remain 0 until the loop body runs.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is the next value in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**
