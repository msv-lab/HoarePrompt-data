Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, `a` is `B[1] + (idx_B[1] - 3) * 2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` to `a`. Given that `r` is 2, `r - 1` is 1. Therefore, the expression becomes `B[1] + (idx_B[1] - 3) * 2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
