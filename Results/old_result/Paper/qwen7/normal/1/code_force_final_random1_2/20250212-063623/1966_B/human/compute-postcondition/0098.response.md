Output State: **`j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m-1]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][m-1]`, `i` is `n-2`**

Explanation: The code sets `impossible` to `False`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
