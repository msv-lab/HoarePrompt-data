Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-2` (the second-to-last value).

3. **Determine the current state of `i` and `n`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n-1`.
   - If `i` is 2, then `n` must be greater than 3.
   - If `i` is 3, then `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - If `i` is 2, then for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than 4.
   - If `i` is 3, then for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 4.

Given these conditions, let's summarize the state adjustments:

- If `i` is 2, then `i` becomes 3 and `n` must be greater than 4.
- If `i` is 3, then `n` must be greater than 4.

Since the problem does not specify which value `i` took in the previous iteration, we consider both possibilities. However, the key adjustment is related to `n` being greater than 4 if `i` is 3.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**
