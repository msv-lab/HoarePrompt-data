N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string contains M characters. The field contains goals for two teams (RG for red goal, BG for blue goal), players (R0-R9 for red team, B0-B9 for blue team), and exactly one Quaffle (.Q). The field also contains integers P such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10, indicating the number of players in each team. The number of steps T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. Each step is described by a valid action involving moving, catching, or throwing the Quaffle.
