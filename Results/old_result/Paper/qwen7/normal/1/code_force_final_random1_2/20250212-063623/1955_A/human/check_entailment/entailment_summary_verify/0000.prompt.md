You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). For each test case, it prints one of three possible values based on the conditions: \(A \times B\), \(\text{int}(A \times C / 2)\), or \(\text{X} \times C + B\) where \(\text{X} = A // 2\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where buying in pairs (at the promotion price) is more cost-effective than buying individually (at the regular price), especially when the number of yogurts is odd. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 5 11`
- Expected Output: `15` (since buying 3 yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying 2 at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price)

However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as follows:
- It checks if `B * 2 < C`, which is `5 * 2 < 11` (True).
- It then prints `A * B`, which is `3 * 5 = 15`.

This is correct for this specific case, but the program fails to consider the scenario where buying in pairs is more cost-effective when the number of yogurts is odd. For example, in the case where `n = 3`, the correct approach would be to buy 1 yogurt at the regular price and 2 yogurts at the promotion price, resulting in a total cost of `5 + 11 = 16`. However, the program incorrectly calculates this as `15`.

To fix this, the program should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible and then add the remaining individual yogurts at the regular price. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        singles = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly.
