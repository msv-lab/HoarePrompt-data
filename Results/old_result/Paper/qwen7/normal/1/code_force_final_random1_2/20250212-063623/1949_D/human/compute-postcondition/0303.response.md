Output State: **`nx` is equal to `nx` plus `xx[0][2]`, `j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nx` by adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is 3, `j - 1` equals 2. Therefore, `nx` is updated to its current value plus the value of `xx[i][2]`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
