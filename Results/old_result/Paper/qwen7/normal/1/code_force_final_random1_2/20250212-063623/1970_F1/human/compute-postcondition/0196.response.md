Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 1, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, and `comand` is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input, `el` is the third element of the `command` list**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first, second, and third elements of the `comand` list to `obj`, `com`, and `el` respectively. Since `comand` is the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input, `el` will be the third element of this list. All other variables remain unchanged.
