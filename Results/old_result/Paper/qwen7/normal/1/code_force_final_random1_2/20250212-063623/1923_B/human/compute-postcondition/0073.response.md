Output State: **`rest` is now equal to `rest - delta`, `pos` is increased by 1, and `delta` remains equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. The value of `delta` is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. After this operation, `rest` is updated to its new value, which is the original `rest` minus `delta`. The value of `pos` is increased by 1, and `delta` remains unchanged because it is not reassigned in this line of code.
