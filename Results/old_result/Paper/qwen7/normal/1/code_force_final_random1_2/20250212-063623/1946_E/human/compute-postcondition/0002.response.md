Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer; and `b`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (m1, m2, n, _). It calculates the value of `c` multiplied by `a` and then takes the result modulo 1000000007.**

Note: The underscore `_` in the tuple indicates that the fourth element (n) is used in the calculation, but the other elements (m1 and m2) are not utilized in the described functionality.
