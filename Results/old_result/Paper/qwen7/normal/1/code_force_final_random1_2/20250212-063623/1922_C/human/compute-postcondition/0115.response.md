Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `m`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `m` is an input integer.
3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j < m`. Therefore, `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to continue executing.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the initial state of `j` (which is 0) is such that the loop can start executing. This means that `j` should be less than `m`.

### Adjusted State:
- `m` is an input integer.
- `j` is 0, and for the loop to start executing, `j` must be less than `m`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`m` is an input integer, `j` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0**.
