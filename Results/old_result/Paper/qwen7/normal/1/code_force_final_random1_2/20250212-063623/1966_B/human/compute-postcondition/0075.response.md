Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` must be greater than 1
   - The postcondition involves checking elements in the matrix `gr`:
     - If the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the last row in `gr`, then `impossible` remains `False`.
     - If neither of these conditions is met, the value of `impossible` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m - 1):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop variable `j` is being incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `m-2` (since `range(m - 1)` generates values from `0` to `m-2`).

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to `1`.

5. **Conditions to Check:**
   - The loop does not directly affect `m` or `impossible`.
   - The loop iterates over `j` but does not change the values of `j` itself; it only increments it.

6. **New State:**
   - `j` will be `1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `m` must still be greater than 1.
   - The postcondition involving `impossible` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `impossible`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, if the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the last row in `gr`, then `impossible` remains `False`. If neither of these conditions is met, the value of `impossible` remains unchanged.**
