Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing one tuple `(i, ind)` which is `(0, 3)`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `i` is 0 and `ind` is 3, the tuple `(0, 3)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. The value of `tmp` determines which list in `goal` the tuple is appended to (either `goal[0]` if `tmp` is 0, or `goal[1]` if `tmp` is 1). The values of other variables remain unchanged.
