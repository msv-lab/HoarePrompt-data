Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is equal to `l`. This means `j` and `l` have the same value.
   - `ans` is a list containing the alphabet characters at the indices calculated by `rev_array[j].count(rev_array[j]) - 1` for each `j` from 0 to `l-1`.
     - `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.
     - `array` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
     - `j` ranges from 0 to `l-1`.
     - For each `j`, `rev_array[j].count(rev_array[j])` counts how many times `rev_array[j]` appears in `rev_array[j]` itself. Since `rev_array[j]` is a single integer, this count is always 1.
     - Therefore, `rev_array[j].count(rev_array[j]) - 1` is always 0.
     - So, `ans` will contain the alphabet character at index 0 for each `j` from 0 to `l-1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
   ```
   - `map(str, ans)` converts each element in `ans` to a string.
   - `''.join(map(str, ans))` joins these string elements into a single string without any separators.

Given the above analysis, `ans` will be a list where each element is the alphabet character at index 0 (which is 'a'), repeated `l` times. Therefore, the joined string will be `'a'` repeated `l` times.

Output: **'a' * l**
