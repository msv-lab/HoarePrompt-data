Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**.

The code `y = s.count('pie')` calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `y`. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
