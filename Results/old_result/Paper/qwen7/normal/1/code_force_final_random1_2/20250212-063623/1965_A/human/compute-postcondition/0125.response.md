Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `test` remains False
   - The condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` determines if the loop breaks.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = len(lis) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `len(lis)`.
   - Since `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` would be 3, which is still within the range as long as `len(lis)` is at least 3.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `test` remains False unless the condition inside the loop changes it.
   - The condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` will be checked again with `j` now being 3.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 3, `test` remains False, and if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] <= 1`, the same conditions hold without any change.**
