Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid and the grid itself.
3. The program then checks if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is the same as the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`).
4. If these two cells are different, it further checks:
   - Whether all cells in the first row are the same.
   - Whether all cells in the first column are the same.
   - Whether all cells in the last row are the same.
   - Whether all cells in the last column are the same.
5. If any of these checks fail, it sets `ans` to 'NO', indicating that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
6. If all checks pass, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.
7. The logic appears to be sound and aligns with the problem statement. It correctly identifies scenarios where it's impossible to make all squares the same color and those where it is possible.

Given this analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the solution based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
