Based on the initial state provided:

- `tc` is greater than 0.
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0.
- `dp` is updated in each iteration of the loop based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and after the loop, `i` is equal to `n`.

Given that `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, let's consider the implications for `dp`:

1. The last element of `arr` is 0.
2. For `dp` to be `True`, the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` must be satisfied at some point during the loop, or `dp` remains `True` if it was initially `True`.

Since `arr` is in descending order and ends with 0, the difference between any two consecutive elements will always be positive and greater than 1 until the last element (0). Therefore, the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` will never be true for the last element (0), but it could be true for any other pair of elements before it.

However, since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` will be checked for each pair of elements, and if it is true for any pair, `dp` will be set to `True`. If no such pair exists, `dp` will remain `False` unless it was initially `True`.

Given that the initial value of `dp` is not specified, we assume it starts as `False` unless otherwise stated. Since the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` is likely to be true for some pairs due to the nature of the list being in descending order, `dp` will be `True` after the loop.

Therefore, the expression `'Alice' if dp else 'Bob'` will evaluate to `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
