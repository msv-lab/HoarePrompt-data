Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]` are filled with their respective values from `data[idx]` starting from `idx = 2 * n + 7`. The variable `idx` is incremented by `n` (the final value of `n`). The prefix XOR array `pf` is fully populated up to `pf[n]` where each `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR from `pf[0]` to `pf[i]`. The dictionary `mp` maps each unique value in the `pf` array to a list of indices where that value appears.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2, `results` list is updated. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `'YES'` is appended to `results`. Otherwise, `'NO'` is appended to `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q with one additional element, which is either 'YES' or 'NO'. `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the left side of `v2` starting from -1 up to the position of `r - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 6 (4 * q + 2), `results` is a list of length q + 2 with one additional element 'YES' or 'NO'. `l` is an integer value from `data` at the index `idx`, `r` is an integer value from `data` at the index `idx + 1`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2`. If the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, then `results` has an additional element 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, `results` has an additional element 'NO' appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
