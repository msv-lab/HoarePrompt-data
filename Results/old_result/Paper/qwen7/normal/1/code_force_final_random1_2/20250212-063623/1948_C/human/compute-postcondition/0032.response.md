Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches a value less than `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer and must be at least 3.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
   - The current value of `i` is such that either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<', leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next possible value for `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 2` must still be within the range defined by the loop condition, i.e., `1 <= i + 2 < n`.

Given that the current value of `i` satisfies the loop condition (either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<'), the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer and must be at least 3.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
- The current value of `i` will be `i + 2`, ensuring that either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<'.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and the current value of `i` is such that either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<'.**
