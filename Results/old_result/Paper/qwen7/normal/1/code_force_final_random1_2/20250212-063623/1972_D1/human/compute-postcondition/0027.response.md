Output State: **The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `rank[da - 1]` is explicitly stated to be equal to `tmp + 1`. The code snippet `return tmp + 1` directly returns this value. Therefore, the program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`.
