Output State: `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user, `i` is `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `tc` remains unchanged at 1. The variable `n` remains the same input integer it was initialized as. The variable `m` also remains unchanged. The list `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input from the user. The variable `i`, which is used in the loop, will be equal to `n-1` after the last iteration of the loop.
