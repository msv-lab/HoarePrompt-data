You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 1000
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: i is equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[j] = 1000 + sum(x[k] for k in range(j+1))`, and `n` retains its value as it was last updated via user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list `x` + 1), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then calculates a list `a` of length `n` where each element `a[j]` is the sum of 1000 and the first `j+1` elements of `x`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
2. \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `x`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - An array `a` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 1000.

3. **Filling the Array**:
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where \( i \geq 1 \)), the value is computed as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
   - This means that each element `a[i]` is derived by adding the corresponding `x[i-1]` to the previous element `a[i-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The array `a` is printed.

### Verification
We need to check if this approach satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

- Let's consider the first few elements:
  - \( a_1 = 1000 \)
  - \( a_2 = a_1 + x_1 = 1000 + x_1 \)
  - \( a_3 = a_2 + x_2 = (1000 + x_1) + x_2 = 1000 + x_1 + x_2 \)
  - And so on...

- For \( x_2 \):
  \[
  x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1 = (1000 + x_1) \bmod 1000 = x_1
  \]
  This is true because \( (1000 + x_1) \bmod 1000 = x_1 \).

- For \( x_3 \):
  \[
  x_3 = a_3 \bmod a_2 = (1000 + x_1 + x_2) \bmod (1000 + x_1) = x_2
  \]
  This is also true because \( (1000 + x_1 + x_2) \bmod (1000 + x_1) = x_2 \).

This pattern holds for all subsequent elements. Therefore, the program correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
