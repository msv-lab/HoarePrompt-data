Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space, `k` is the second integer from the input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `x` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from another input string using map and split functions.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
