Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `res` is an input string (no specific value given)
   - `best` is set to 2 if `res` equals '<', otherwise it remains unchanged

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `res` remains an input string (no specific value given), but since the loop condition does not depend on `res`, its state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is an input string**
