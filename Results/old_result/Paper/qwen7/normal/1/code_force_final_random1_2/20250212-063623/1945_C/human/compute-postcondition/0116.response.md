Output State: **`zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is `n - 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1. The values of `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `i` are recalculated based on the updated value of `zero`. Since `i` was initially `n - 1`, after incrementing `zero`, `i` becomes `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
