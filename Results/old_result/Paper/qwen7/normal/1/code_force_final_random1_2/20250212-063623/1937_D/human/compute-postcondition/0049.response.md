Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and the current value of `s[i]` is either '<' or not less than or equal to '<'. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `B` is updated by appending `x` to it, where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.
