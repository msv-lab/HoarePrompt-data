Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` for `i` in the range of `n` is an integer entered by the user.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the index `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its cycles. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will each contain `n` integers, which were provided by the user during each iteration of the loop.
