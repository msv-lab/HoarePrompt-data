Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `gr`. Since `gr` was initially an empty list, after appending the input, it now contains one element which is the user's input. The values of `tc`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.
