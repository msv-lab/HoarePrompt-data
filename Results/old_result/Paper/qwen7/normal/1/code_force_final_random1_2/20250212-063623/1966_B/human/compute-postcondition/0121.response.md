Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is 'YES', and the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr` with the indices adjusted by subtracting 1 from the respective positions.
