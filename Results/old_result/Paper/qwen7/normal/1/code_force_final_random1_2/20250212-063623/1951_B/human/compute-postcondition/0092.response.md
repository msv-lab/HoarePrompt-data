Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `s`, `s[1:]` is the list starting from the second element of the list `s` with the first and last elements swapped, and `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The values of `i` and `s[1:]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
