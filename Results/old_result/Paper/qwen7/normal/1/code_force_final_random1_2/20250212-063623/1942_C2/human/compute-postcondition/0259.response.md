Output State: **`ans` is `x + 1`, `y` is an input integer, `t` is `1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted set of integers where each element is one less than its original value in the list, `i` is `4`, `t1` is `(a[3] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[4] + 2) % n**.

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially `x`, after the code executes, `ans` becomes `x + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
