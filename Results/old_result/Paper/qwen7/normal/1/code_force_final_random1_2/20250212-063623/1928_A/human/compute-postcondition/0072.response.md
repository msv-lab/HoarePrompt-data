Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). It checks whether either \(a\) or \(b\) can become even by repeatedly dividing them by 2. If either \(a\) or \(b\) can become even and match the other number after division, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
