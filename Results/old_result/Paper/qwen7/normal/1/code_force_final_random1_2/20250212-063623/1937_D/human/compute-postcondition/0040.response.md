Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `i` to `n - 1 - j`. Given that `j` is initially 0, `i` is now set to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
