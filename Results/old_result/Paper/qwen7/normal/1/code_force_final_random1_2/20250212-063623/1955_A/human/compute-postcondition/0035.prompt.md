Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the current state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the state also remains unchanged. If `A` is odd, `i` is 0, `A` is the first input integer divided by 2, `B` is the second input integer, and `C` is the third input integer with `B * 2` being greater than or equal to `C`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A` is the first integer input, `B` is the second integer input, `C` is the third integer input, and if `B * 2 < C`, then no change occurs. If `B * 2 >= C`, and `A` is even, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer input, `B` is the second integer input, `C` is the third integer input, and `next_input` is the fourth integer input provided by the user. If `B * 2 < C`, the condition is not met and the program continues without changing `X`. Otherwise, if `A` is even, `X` is set to `A // 2`. If `A` is odd, `X` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
