Output State: **`i` is 1; `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` evaluates to `a[1] - a[0]`. Since `i` was 1 before the operation and no other changes were made to `i`, its value remains 1. The list `ad` is initialized with the calculated difference.
