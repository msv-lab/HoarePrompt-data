Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is the result of `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables (`tc`, `arr`, `dp`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
