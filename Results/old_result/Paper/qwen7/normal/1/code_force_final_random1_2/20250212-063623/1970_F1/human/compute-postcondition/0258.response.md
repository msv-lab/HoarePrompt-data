Functionality: **The function processes a game scenario represented by a grid and updates the state of the game over a specified number of steps. It reads the initial setup of the game from standard input, including the dimensions of the grid, the positions of players, goals, and other entities, and the number of steps. During each step, it handles various game events such as players catching the Quaffle, moving, scoring goals, and eliminating other players. Finally, it prints the final scores of both teams.**
