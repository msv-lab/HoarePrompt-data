Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop will start with `i` being 0 because `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`.
3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be a non-negative integer. This means `n` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `m-1`
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `impossible` is `True`
- `ans` is 'NO'

We need to focus on adjusting the states related to the loop head, specifically `i` and `n`.

Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop runs from 0 to `n-2`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. There are no direct mentions or dependencies of `j`, `m`, `impossible`, or `ans` on the loop itself, so these states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 0**
