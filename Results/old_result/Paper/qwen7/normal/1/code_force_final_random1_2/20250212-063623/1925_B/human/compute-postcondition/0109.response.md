Output State: **The final value of `ans` is the maximum value among all `i` and `x // i` that satisfy the conditions within the loop for all iterations.**

To explain this output state in natural language:

After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` holds the maximum value found during any iteration of the loop where the conditions `x % i == 0` and either `(x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0)` or `(x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x // i) > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` are satisfied for all possible values of `i` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. This means that `ans` will contain the highest value that meets these criteria across all test cases and inputs processed by the loop.
