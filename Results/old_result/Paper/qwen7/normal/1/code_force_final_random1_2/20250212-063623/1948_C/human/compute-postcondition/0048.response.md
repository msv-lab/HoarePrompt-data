Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
- The current value of `a[i]` is '<'.
- `b[i + 1]` is also '<' or the current value of `b[i - 1]` is '<'.

The print statement is `print('No')`.

Given this information, the print statement directly outputs the string `'No'` without referencing any variables or their values.

Output: **No**
