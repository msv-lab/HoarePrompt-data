Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n - 2` to `i = 1` (since the loop increments `i` by `-1`).

3. **Determine Initial Values**:
   - The final value of `i` after the loop completes all iterations is `n - 2`.
   - The initial value of `i` should be `n - 2` because the loop starts from `i = n - 2`.
   - The variable `n` remains greater than 2, so `n` must be at least 3.

4. **Consider the Other Given Conditions**:
   - `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
   - `d1[n]` is updated based on the conditions within the loop for each iteration. However, since we are only adjusting the initial state for the loop to execute, we do not need to specify the exact value of `d1[n]` at this point.

5. **Formulate the State**:
   - We need to set `i` to `n - 2` as the initial value.
   - We need to ensure `n` is at least 3.
   - We do not need to specify the exact value of `d1[n]` or `d2[n - 1]` as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 3**
