To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze each function step by step.

### Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`
This function aims to construct a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`. Here's how it works:
1. It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. It iteratively modifies this list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
3. If `k` becomes zero, it returns the current list `l`.
4. Otherwise, it performs swaps to adjust the values until `k` is exhausted.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
This function checks if a permutation with the given `n` and `k` exists:
1. It checks if `k` is even because the Manhattan value is always even.
2. It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
3. If `k` exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
4. Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

### Function 3: `func_3(l)`
This function prints the result:
1. It prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.

### Function 4: `func_4()`
This function ties everything together:
1. It calls `func_2()` to get the parameters.
2. If `n` is zero, it prints "NO" and exits.
3. Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then `func_3()` to print it.

### Analysis
1. **Function 2** correctly identifies whether a solution is possible based on the parity of `k` and the maximum possible Manhattan value.
2. **Function 1** attempts to construct the permutation, but there are issues:
   - The logic for swapping elements is flawed. It doesn't guarantee that the Manhattan value will be exactly `k`.
   - The approach of popping and inserting elements might not always lead to the correct permutation.
3. **Function 3** and **Function 4** are correct in their implementation.

### Testing Cases
Let's test the functions with the provided examples:

#### Example 1: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
- `func_2()` returns `(3, 4)`.
- `func_1(3, 4)` should return a permutation with Manhattan value 4.
- The correct permutation is `[3, 1, 2]` with Manhattan value \(|3-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\).
- `func_3([3, 1, 2])` prints "YES 3 1 2".

#### Example 2: `n = 4`, `k = 5`
- `func_2()` returns `(0, 0)` because 5 is odd and cannot be achieved.
- `func_4()` prints "NO".

#### Example 3: `n = 7`, `k = 0`
- `func_2()` returns `(7, 0)`.
- `func_1(7, 0)` should return the identity permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- `func_3([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])` prints "YES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7".

#### Example 4: `n = 1`, `k = 1000000000000`
- `func_2()` returns `(0, 0)` because 1000000000000 is too large.
- `func_4()` prints "NO".

### Conclusion
The core issue lies in **Function 1** where the logic for constructing the permutation is flawed. While the other functions are correct, the overall program will fail for many cases due to the incorrect construction method in `func_1`.

**Correctness: False**
