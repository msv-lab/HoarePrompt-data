Output State: **`i` is 4; `bd` includes the new element `b[4] - b[3]` and the updated list is `[b[4] - b[3]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[4] - b[3]` to the list `bd`. Since `i` is 4, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` evaluates to `b[4] - b[3]`. Initially, `bd` includes this element, and now it remains the same with the appended value.
