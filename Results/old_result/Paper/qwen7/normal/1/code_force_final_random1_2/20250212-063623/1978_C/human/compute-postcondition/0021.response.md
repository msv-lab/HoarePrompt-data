Postcondition: `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`, where `c` is increased by 2, `i` is `i - 2`, and `k` is equal to `k - (i - 2) + 1`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. The function always returns `l` under the condition that `k` is not equal to `0` and is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.
