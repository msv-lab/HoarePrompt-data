Output State: **The input string `s` has been fully processed, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, the variable `cur_ss` represents the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and it resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\), and `tmp` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = ''` initializes the variable `tmp` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, or `cur_ss`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
