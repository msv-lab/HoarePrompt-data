Output State: **`tmp` is 'c', `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` changes the value of `tmp`. Since `i` was initially set to 2, `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `97 + 2`, which is `99`. The `chr(99)` function returns the character corresponding to the ASCII value 99, which is `'c'`. All other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
