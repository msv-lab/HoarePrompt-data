Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
- `a` is the integer entered first after the space.
- `b` is the integer entered second after the space.
- `a1` is `a // 2`.
- `a2` is `a // 2`.
- `b1` is `b // 2`.
- `b2` is `b // 2`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. Since no values of `a` and `b` are specified, the values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **Yes**
