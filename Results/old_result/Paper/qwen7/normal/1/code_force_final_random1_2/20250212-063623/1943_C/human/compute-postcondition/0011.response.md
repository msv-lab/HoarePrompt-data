Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, with one list at index `v-1` now containing the value `[u-1], v` is `v-1`.**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v` is now `v-1`, while `n` and the structure of `u2vs` remain as they were in the initial state.
