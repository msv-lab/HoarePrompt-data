Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`; `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, starting from `a[1] - a[0]` up to `a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a` minus one (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include the length of `a`). The list `ad` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a`.
