Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input correctly, splitting it into multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it processes the array and its prefix XOR values efficiently using a dictionary to store the prefix XOR values and their corresponding indices.
3. It then handles each query by checking if there exists a subarray within the specified range whose bitwise XOR is zero.
4. The logic for determining if a subarray has a bitwise XOR of zero is sound:
   - If the prefix XOR value at the end of the subarray (`pf[r]`) is equal to the prefix XOR value just before the start of the subarray (`pf[l-1]`), then the subarray `a_l,...,a_r` has a bitwise XOR of zero.
   - This is because `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]` would be zero, indicating that the XOR of the subarray is zero.
5. The program uses binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find appropriate indices in the stored prefix XOR values, which is efficient for this purpose.
6. The program correctly appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on the query outcome and appends an empty string after processing all queries for a test case.
7. The overall structure and logic of the program align with the problem requirements and the provided execution summary.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
