Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 3 and 200,000), `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (integers between 1 and `n-2` such that their sum equals `n`), and a list of `n` positive integers called `numbers`. It first sorts the `numbers` list in descending order. Then, it attempts to distribute the numbers into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively, checking if the sums of the elements in each group can be made equal. If successful, it returns 'YES' along with the sizes of the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
