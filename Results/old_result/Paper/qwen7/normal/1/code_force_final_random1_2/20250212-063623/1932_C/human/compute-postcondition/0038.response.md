Output State: **`v` is the last element of `b`, `p` is `p * v % m`, `ans` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are `p` and the third element is also `p`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains two elements, both equal to `p`. After appending `p`, `ans` now contains three elements, all equal to `p`. The values of `v`, `p`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
