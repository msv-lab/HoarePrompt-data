Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of n lines, each containing n characters representing a partial transition video plan. These characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.' (no transition video). The function updates two lists, `a` and `b`, to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' at each position across all inputs. It then determines two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on these counts. Depending on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`, the function constructs and prints a new string for each line, replacing '?' with either 'F' or 'S' based on specific conditions. If `sa` is longer than or equal to `sb`, it prioritizes 'F'; otherwise, it prioritizes 'S'. Finally, the function outputs these constructed strings.**
