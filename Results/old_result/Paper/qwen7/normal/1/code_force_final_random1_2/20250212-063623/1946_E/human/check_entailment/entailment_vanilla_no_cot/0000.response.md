Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code includes two functions `func_1` and `func_2`, but these functions do not seem to be directly related to solving the problem described. The problem requires determining the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial logic rather than the Euclidean algorithm implemented in `func_1`.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement logic that takes into account the constraints provided by the prefix and suffix maximums to count the valid permutations. The current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not contribute to solving the permutation counting problem as described.
