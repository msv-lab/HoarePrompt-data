Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - From the postcondition, we know that at the end of the previous iteration:
     - `j` is 2 if it was 1, otherwise 1.
     - `n` is greater than 0.
     - The element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is either 'S' or 'F'.
     - If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S', otherwise `nx` is 'F'.
     - If the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is 'F', then `nx` becomes 'SF' when `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, and 'FF' otherwise.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will increment `j` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1, the next value of `j` will be 3 (if it was 2).

4. **Update the State**:
   - `j` will be 3 (since it was 2 and the loop increments it by 1).
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Final State**:
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `n` is still greater than 0.
   - The conditions for `nx` remain the same as they depend on the values of `i`, `sb`, and `xx[i]`, which are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0**.
