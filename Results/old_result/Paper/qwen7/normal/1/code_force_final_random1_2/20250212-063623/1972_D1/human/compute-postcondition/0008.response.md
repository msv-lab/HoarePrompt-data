Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6) are processed.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integer values within given ranges, and process them accordingly without accepting any direct parameters from the caller.
