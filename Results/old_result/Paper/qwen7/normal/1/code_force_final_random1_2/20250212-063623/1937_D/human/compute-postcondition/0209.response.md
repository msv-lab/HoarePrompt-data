Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, `x` is -2, `b` is 1, `b` is calculated as (-2 - 3) * (2 + 1) which equals -15.**

This means that the value of `b` has been updated to -15 due to the calculation `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
