Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Time Interval:**
   - The program calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`.
   - This value represents the minimum interval after which the next set of fireworks from either installation could potentially overlap in visibility.

3. **Checking Conditions for Maximum Overlap:**
   - The program checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` (`m % a == 0 and m % b == 0`).
   - It also ensures that neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1 (`a != 1 and b != 1`).
   - If these conditions are met, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the same installation do not overlap in visibility.
   - Fireworks from different installations can overlap if their intervals align within the visibility period `m + 1`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key insight is that the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks occurs when the intervals of the two installations align perfectly within the visibility period.
   - This happens when `m` is a common multiple of `a` and `b`.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies the condition where `m` is a common multiple of `a` and `b`.
   - When this condition is met, the formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` is used to calculate the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.
   - This formula accounts for the fact that one additional firework from each installation can be seen simultaneously due to the alignment of intervals.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` or `b` is 1 separately, which is unnecessary because the main logic already covers all cases.
   - The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` have a common divisor other than 1, but this is covered by checking if `m` is a common multiple.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks. The conditions and calculations are appropriate for the problem statement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
