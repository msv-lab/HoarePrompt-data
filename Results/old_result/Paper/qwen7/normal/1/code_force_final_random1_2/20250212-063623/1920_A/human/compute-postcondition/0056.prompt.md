Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and updated to the integer input value, `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `t` is 3, since the condition `t == 3` is met, the function does nothing and the values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from input, `v` is the second integer from input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from input, and if `t` does not equal 2, `start` remains unchanged; if `t` equals 2, `end` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `num` is a list containing [v], and if `start` is less than `v`, then `start` remains unchanged; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
