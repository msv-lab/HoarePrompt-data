Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value, and `array2` contains all elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where the difference between `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]` is less than `b / a`. If the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the condition holds. Otherwise, `array2` includes all elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where the difference between `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `b / a`.
