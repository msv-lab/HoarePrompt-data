Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases (which is provided as input at the start), `n` will be an integer between 1 and 100 for each iteration, and `word` will be constructed based on the value of `n` according to the rules specified in the loop body.**

In more detail:
- The variable `i` will hold the total count of iterations, which is determined by the first input value (the number of test cases).
- For each test case, `n` will be an integer within the range of 3 to 78 (as specified in the loop body conditions).
- The variable `word` will be constructed as follows:
  - If `n > 52`, then `word` will be `'zz'` followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53`.
  - If `27 < n <= 52`, then `word` will be `'az'` followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`.
  - If `1 <= n <= 26`, then `word` will be `'aaa'` followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 3`.

This construction continues for each test case until all iterations are completed.
