Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For `i = 3`, the condition `i + 1 < n` becomes `4 < n`. This means `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.
   - We don't need to check the character conditions since they depend on the values of `a` and `b`, which are not specified to change.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` remains 3 because it is incremented within the loop body, but we are adjusting the state before the next iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than 4 to satisfy the condition `i + 1 < n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `a` and `b` are lists of characters**
