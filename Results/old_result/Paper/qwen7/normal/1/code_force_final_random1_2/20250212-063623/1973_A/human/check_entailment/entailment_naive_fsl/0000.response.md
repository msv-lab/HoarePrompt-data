Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the scores are (1, 1, 2) correctly. According to the problem description, the scores (1, 1, 2) are achievable through two games: one win-lose game and one draw game. However, the program incorrectly returns -1 for this case. 

To verify this, let's manually check the logic:

- For scores (1, 1, 2):
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\)
  - Total matches: \(4 / 2 = 2\)
  - Since \(p_3 = 2\) and \(p_2 = 1\), the difference in points is \(2 - 1 = 1\).
  - The number of wins/losses is \(2 \times 1 = 2\).
  - The remaining points are \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\), which should be distributed as draws.
  - Therefore, the number of draws should be \(2 / 2 = 1\).

However, the program incorrectly returns -1 for this case. Thus, the program is incorrect.
