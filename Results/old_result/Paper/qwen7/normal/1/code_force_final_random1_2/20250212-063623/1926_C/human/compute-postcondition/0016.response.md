Output State: **`pd[i]` is increased by the value of `int(j)`**.

In this case, the code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Since the initial values of `pd` and `i` are not specified, we only know that `pd[i]` has been updated to its original value plus the integer value of `j`. The state of `j` itself is not relevant to the output state, and no other variables are affected.
