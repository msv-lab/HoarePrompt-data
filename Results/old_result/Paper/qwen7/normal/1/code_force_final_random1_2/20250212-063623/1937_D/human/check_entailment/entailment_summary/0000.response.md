Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by breaking down the string into two parts: processing from left to right and from right to left. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation that make the program incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `A` and `B`:**
   - The arrays `A` and `B` are supposed to store the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from the leftmost and rightmost positions, respectively. However, the current implementation does not correctly account for the inversion of directions and the actual movement of the pinball.
   
2. **Incorrect Use of `idx_A` and `idx_B`:**
   - The indices stored in `idx_A` and `idx_B` are not used correctly to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. The logic for calculating the time based on these indices is flawed.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundaries of the grid. For example, if the pinball starts at the first or last cell, it should take fewer steps to leave the grid.

4. **Complexity and Overcomplication:**
   - The program uses complex arithmetic operations and nested conditions that do not accurately reflect the movement of the pinball. The current approach is overly complicated and does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
