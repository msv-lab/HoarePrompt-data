Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `n` is `R()`, `x` is the final value after the loop completes, `y` is `R()`, `sx` is equal to `x`, `l` is a sorted list containing elements generated by `R()` with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing all values of `c` where `c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` if `c` equals 1 during each iteration of the loop, and `val` is sorted by a key that first checks if the value is even or odd (with even coming first) and then by the value itself.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `n` is `R()`, `x` is the final value after the loop completes, `y` is `R() - (i // 2)`, `sx` is `x + y * 2 + i`, `l` is a sorted list containing elements generated by `R()` with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, and if `y < c`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is `R()`, `x` is the final value after the loop completes, `y` is `R() - ((i_prev + 1) // 2) - c`, `sx` is `x + y * 2 + (i_prev + 1) + y * 2 + i`, `l` is a sorted list containing elements generated by `R()` with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `i // 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is `R()`, `x` is the final value after the loop completes, `y` is `R() - (i_prev + 1) // 2 - c`, `sx` is `x + y * 2 + (i_prev + 1) + y * 2 + (i_prev + 1) + 1 + y * 2 + i`, `l` is a sorted list containing elements generated by `R()` with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `(i_prev + 1) // 2`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
