Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` for the loop to execute one more time, `new2[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`**.

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `new[i]`, `a[i]`, and `new2[i]` remain the same as they did before the increment, meaning `new[i]` is still the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `a[i]` is still equal to `b[i]` for the loop to execute one more time, and `new2[i]` is still the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
