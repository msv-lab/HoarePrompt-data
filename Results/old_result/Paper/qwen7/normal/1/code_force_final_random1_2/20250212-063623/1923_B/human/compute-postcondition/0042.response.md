Output State: **`rest` is `k - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` to the variable `delta`. This means that `delta` now holds the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The value of `rest` is reduced by this minimum value. The variable `pos` remains unchanged, and its condition of being less than `len(sorted_indices)` still holds true.
