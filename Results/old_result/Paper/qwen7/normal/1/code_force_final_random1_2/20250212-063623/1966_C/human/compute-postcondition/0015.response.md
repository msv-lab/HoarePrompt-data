Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is the result of `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `tc -= 1` decrements the value of `tc` by 1. Since `tc` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, `tc` is now greater than 0 minus 1. The values of `n`, `arr`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
