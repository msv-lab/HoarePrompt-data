Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for all possible cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid seems overly complex and does not accurately reflect the movement rules described in the problem statement.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3
<><
```

Expected Output:
```
1 4 2 
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
1 4 3 
```

This discrepancy arises because the program incorrectly calculates the time for the pinball to move from the third cell back to the left boundary. The correct calculation should account for the exact number of steps the pinball takes, considering the inversion of the direction at each step. The provided solution does not handle this correctly, leading to an incorrect result for the third cell.
