Output State: All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for each `i` in `b_values`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every element in the set `b_values` will have been processed exactly once. The counter `cnt_b` for each element `i` in `b_values` will be set to 0.
