Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`**.

In this case, the code `a = B[r]` assigns the value of `B[r]` to `a`. Since `r` is decreased by 1, `a` will take the value of the element in list `B` at index `r`. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
