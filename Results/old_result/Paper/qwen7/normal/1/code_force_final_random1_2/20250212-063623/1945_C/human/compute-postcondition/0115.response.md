Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(n - 1)`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `zero` is increased by 1.
   - `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
   - `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
   - If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is set to a list containing `i + 1`. Otherwise, no change to the variables.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1`.

Given this information, let's update the state:

- `i` will be `n - 1`.
- The conditions for `zero_perc` and `one_perc` remain the same because they are calculated based on the current values of `zero`, `one`, `o`, and `n`, which do not change within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is `n - 1`**.
