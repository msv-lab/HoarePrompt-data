Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty is achieved when the largest element is paired with the smallest element to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

- The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
- It sorts the array, which arranges the elements in ascending order.
- By taking the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array, it effectively maximizes the beauty as per the definition given in the problem statement.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program should work as intended for the problem description provided.

Correctness: **True**
