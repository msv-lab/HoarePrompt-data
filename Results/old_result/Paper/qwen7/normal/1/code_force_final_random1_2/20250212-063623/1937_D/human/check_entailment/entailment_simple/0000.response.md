Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - The function processes the string `s` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to store intermediate results based on the positions of `>` and `<` respectively.
   - The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is correct. For each cell, it checks the direction of the pinball and calculates the time accordingly.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loops correctly iterate through the string `s` to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The conditions for updating `A` and `B` are correct based on the rules provided.
   - The final loop that prints the results for each cell is also correctly implemented, considering both directions (`>` and `<`) and the intermediate results stored in `A` and `B`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where there are no `>` or `<` in the string, ensuring the pinball leaves the grid in the minimum possible time.
   - The logic for handling the boundary conditions (leftmost and rightmost cells) is correctly implemented.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell, adhering to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
