Output State: `ntest` is an input integer, and `itest` is equal to `ntest`; for each iteration `it` in the range from 0 to `ntest-1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to the input split, and the loop has printed the difference between the maximum and minimum value in each list `a`.

This means after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ntest` will be the last index value of `itest`, which is `ntest-1`. For each of the `ntest` inputs, a list `a` was sorted and the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in each list was printed.
