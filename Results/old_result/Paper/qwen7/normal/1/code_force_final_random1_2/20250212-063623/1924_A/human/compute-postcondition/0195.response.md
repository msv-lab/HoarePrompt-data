Output State: **All characters of the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \(2^k - 1\), `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is appended with `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code appends 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times to `ans`. Since `n`, `cnt`, and `ans` are the only variables affected, `ans` is updated accordingly. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.
