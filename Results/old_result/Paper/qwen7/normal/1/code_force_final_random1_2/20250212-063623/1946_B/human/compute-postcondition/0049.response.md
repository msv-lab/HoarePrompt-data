Output State: `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, inclusive. The values of `suf` and `smin` remain unchanged from their final states after the loop has executed all iterations, and `n` remains its final value from the loop execution.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `sm` will hold the highest value obtained from evaluating `suf[i] - smin[i]` for every index `i` within the range of the loop. The lists `suf` and `smin` and the variable `n` retain their last computed values from the loop's final iteration.
