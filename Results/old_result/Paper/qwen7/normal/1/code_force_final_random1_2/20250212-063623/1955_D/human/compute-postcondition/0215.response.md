Output State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the next element in `b_values`**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0. This means that the count for the current element `i` in `b_values` is initialized to 0. The value of `i` itself remains unchanged and is still considered to be the next element in `b_values`.
