Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[2]` to be the sum of `a[1]` and `x[1]`. Given the initial state where `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, we substitute this into the equation to get `a[2]` as `(a[0] + x[0]) + x[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
