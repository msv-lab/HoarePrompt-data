Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`.**

The code assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. The values of `t`, `m`, and `count` remain unchanged.
