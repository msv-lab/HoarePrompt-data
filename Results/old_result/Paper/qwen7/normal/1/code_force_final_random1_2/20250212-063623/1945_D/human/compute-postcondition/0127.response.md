The only object in the loop head is the variable `c` and the variable `cases`. Since all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `c` must have reached its final value, which is equal to `cases`.

Given that all iterations have been executed, it means that `c` is now equal to `cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` would need to be incremented by 1 and be less than `cases`. However, since all iterations have already been executed, `c` cannot be incremented further.

Therefore, the state cannot be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time because the condition `c < cases` is no longer satisfied.

State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed, `c` is equal to `cases`**
