Postcondition: `i` is an integer starting from 3. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `i` is set to 4, `array2` becomes `[arr[3] - arr[2] * a]`, and `n` must still be greater than 1. If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] >= b / a` holds, then no changes are made to `i`, `array2`, and `n` remains greater than 1.
