Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r**.

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `b` is now adjusted based on the new value of `i`.
