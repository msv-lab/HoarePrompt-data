Output State: **`x` is the input string or integer entered by the user, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[i]` is increased by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know that it has been incremented. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
