Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `power` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't affect the loop execution)
   - `i` is 2

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < n` must be true.
   - Currently, `power` is 3, so `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop head only involves `power` and `n`, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 3.
   - The other states (`power`, `n_cases`, and `i`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`power` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**
