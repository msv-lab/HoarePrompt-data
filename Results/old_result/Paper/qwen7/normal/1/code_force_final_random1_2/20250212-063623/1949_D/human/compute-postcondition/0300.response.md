Postcondition: `j` is 2 or 3, `n` is a positive integer, and `nx` is determined as follows:
- If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j-1]` plus `xx[i][j-1]`.
- If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'S' if either `i` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]` or `j` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]`, otherwise `nx` is 'F'.
