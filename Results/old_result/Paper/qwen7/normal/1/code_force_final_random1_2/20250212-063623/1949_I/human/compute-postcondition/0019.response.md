Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, `visited` remains unchanged and is still filled with `False`, `coef` is updated such that `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is False.**

The value of `coef[i]` (where `i` is 0) is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
