Output State: `tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from the append operation, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO'.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `tc` remains 2, `t` stays unchanged, `n` must be at least 3 (since we know it needs to go through at least 3 iterations), `m` is still an input integer, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), and `ans` remains 'NO'.
