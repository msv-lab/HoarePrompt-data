You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: `a` is 2, `L` is [], `pow` is 16, `tot` is 12.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `L` becomes empty as the loop continues to process until `n` reaches 0. The variable `a` takes on the value of the last element added to `L`, which is 2. The variable `pow` is doubled in each iteration of the loop, starting from 8 after 3 iterations, and doubles again for each additional iteration until the loop completes. Since the loop processes until `L` is empty and `n` is 0, `pow` doubles for each of the 3 elements in `L`, resulting in `pow` being 16 (2^4). The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, which is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and it continues to be incremented by `a` (which is 2) for each full iteration of `L` being processed, resulting in `tot` being 12 (6 + 6).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, it constructs a sequence \( L \) by repeatedly dividing \( n \) by 2 and subtracting the result from \( n \). It then iterates over this sequence, determining a value to print based on the position of \( k \) within the cumulative sum of elements in \( L \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Odd Number Count Calculation:**
   - The program calculates how many odd-numbered cards can be placed in the sequence.
   - Specifically, it computes `m = (n + 1) // 2`, which gives the count of odd numbers up to `n`.
   - It then subtracts this count from `n` and appends `m` to the list `L`.

3. **Binary Search-Like Approach:**
   - The program initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - It iterates over the list `L` (which contains counts of cards at different multiples of odd numbers).
   - For each element `a` in `L`, it checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]`.
   - If it does, it calculates the card number using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

4. **Card Number Calculation:**
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly maps the position `k` to the corresponding card number.
   - Here, `pow` keeps track of the current multiple (starting from 1), and `(2 * (k - tot) - 1)` ensures the correct odd number is selected.

5. **Updating Totals:**
   - After determining the card number, it updates `tot` by adding `a` to it.
   - `pow` is updated by multiplying it with 2 to move to the next multiple.

### Verification:

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 7`, `k = 1`
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - First card is 1.
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 7`, `k = 2`
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Second card is 3.
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Third card is 5.
- **Test Case 4:** `n = 7`, `k = 4`
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Fourth card is 7.
- **Test Case 5:** `n = 7`, `k = 5`
  - Twice the odd numbers: 2, 6
  - Fifth card is 2.
- **Test Case 6:** `n = 7`, `k = 6`
  - Twice the odd numbers: 2, 6
  - Sixth card is 6.
- **Test Case 7:** `n = 7`, `k = 7`
  - Four times the odd numbers: 4
  - Seventh card is 4.

The program correctly identifies the positions of the cards as per the rules described.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the `k`-th card laid down by Vladislav. Therefore, the program is correct.
