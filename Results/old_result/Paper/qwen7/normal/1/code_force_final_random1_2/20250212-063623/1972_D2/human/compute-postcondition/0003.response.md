Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:** `t` must be greater than 0.
- **For Loop Statement:** 
  ```python
  for _ in range(t):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is typically an underscore indicating that the variable is not used within the loop body.
   - The loop condition is controlled by the variable `t`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 (since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`).

3. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we do not need to adjust it.
   - We need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

### New State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 (so that it can be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0).

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1**
