Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is a list containing `m`, where `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2**.

This means that the value of `m` has been updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
