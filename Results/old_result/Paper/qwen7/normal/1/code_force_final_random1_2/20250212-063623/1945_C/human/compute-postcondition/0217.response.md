Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 10, `ele` is 20, `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20].**

Explanation: Given that the loop runs from the first element of `lst` to the last, and it has executed 3 times so far with `lst` containing `[5, 10, 15]`, the next iteration would involve the fourth element of `lst`, which is `20`. During each iteration, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. Since no specific value for `pk` or its initial value is provided, we assume `mini` is initialized to a value greater than 10 (as seen in the previous iterations), and `abs(pk - 20)` is less than or equal to 10, thus updating `mini` to 10. The value of `ele` becomes 20, and `lst` now includes 20 as its last element.
