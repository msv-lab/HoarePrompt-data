Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', and `l` is greater than or equal to `r`; `a` is equal to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r**.

This means that the variable `a` has been assigned the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values from the initial state.
