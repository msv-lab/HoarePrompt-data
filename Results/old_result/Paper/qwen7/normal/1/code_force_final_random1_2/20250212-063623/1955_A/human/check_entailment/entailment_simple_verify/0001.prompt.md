You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `t - 1`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are the last set of inputs provided by the user during the loop's execution. Depending on the conditions within the loop, either `A * B`, `int(A * C / 2)`, or `X * C + B` (where `X = A // 2`) was printed for each iteration. The variable `X` retains its final value after the last iteration based on the conditions evaluated.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Logic:**
   - The program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`C`) is less than the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at price `a`. Hence, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - Otherwise, it proceeds to check if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
       - If `A` is even, it calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which means buying all yogurts in pairs.
       - If `A` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic handles the scenario where the number of yogurts is odd by buying the maximum number of pairs and then buying the last yogurt separately.
   - It correctly accounts for the scenario where the promotional price for two yogurts is better than buying them individually.

### Testing with Provided Examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Here, `B * 2 = 10 > C = 9`, so it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
   - Output: `2 * 5 = 10` (but the expected output is `9`).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Here, `B * 2 = 10 > C = 9`, so it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
   - Output: `3 * 5 = 15` (but the expected output is `14`).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Here, `B * 2 = 10 < C = 11`, so it's cheaper to buy in pairs.
   - Output: `1 * 11 + 5 = 16` (but the expected output is `15`).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Here, `B * 2 = 10 < C = 11`, so it's cheaper to buy in pairs.
   - Output: `4 * 5 = 20` (expected output is `20`).

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the cases correctly when the promotional price for two yogurts is better than buying them individually. Specifically, it fails to account for the optimal way to buy the remaining yogurt when the total number of yogurts is odd.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**
