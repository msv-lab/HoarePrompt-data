You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are lists of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i from 1 to n; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    custos = []
    for i in range(x):
        custo = 0
        
        num_fila = 0
        
        max_p = 0
        
        a_values = []
        
        b_values = []
        
        nf = input().split()
        
        num_fila = int(nf[0])

        a = input().split()
        
        b = input().split()
        
        for y in a:
            a_values.append(int(y))
        
        for y in b:
            b_values.append(int(y))
        
        for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
            if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
                custo += a_values[y]
            else:
                custo += b_values[y]
        
        for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
            if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
                custo += b_values[y]
                if y == 1:
                    custo += a_values[0]
                    break
            else:
                custo += a_values[y]
                break
        
        custos.append(custo)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `y` will be 0, `max_p` will remain as the integer value of `nf[1]`, `num_fila` will remain as `int(nf[0])`, `b` will remain an empty list, `b_values` will be a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` will be a list containing the value of `custo` for each iteration, and `custo` will be the final sum calculated by adding either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited; `custos.append(custo)` appends the final value of `custo` to the list `custos`.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: The loop will iterate over all elements in the list `custos`. The variable `c` will take on the value of each element in `custos` in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000) for each test case, and two lists of positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i from 1 to n). The function returns a result based on the conditions provided for each test case.
