Output State: **`i` is 3, `nx` is 'S', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and the condition on `xx[i][j - 1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
