Output State: **`new2[i+1]' is equal to the maximum of `a[i+1]' and `b[i+1]', while `new[i+1]' is equal to the minimum of `a[i+1]' and `b[i+1]'**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. This means that the next index considered will be `i+1`. The values of `new2` and `new` are updated based on the new index `i+1`, where `new2[i+1]` is the maximum of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, and `new[i+1]` is the minimum of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`. The initial conditions for other variables remain unchanged.
