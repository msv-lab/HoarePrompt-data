Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` to the current value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
