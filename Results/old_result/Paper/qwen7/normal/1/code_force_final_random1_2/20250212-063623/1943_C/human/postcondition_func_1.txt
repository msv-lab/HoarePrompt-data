The function processes an input tree structure and computes a specific sequence of operations based on a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal. It first constructs the tree from user input, then performs BFS twice to find a specific node and its predecessor path. Depending on the length of the path, it generates a list of operations (tuples) and prints the count and details of these operations. The function ultimately returns nothing (None).
