Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r - l]`**

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[r - l]` subtracts the value of `B[r - l]` from `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
