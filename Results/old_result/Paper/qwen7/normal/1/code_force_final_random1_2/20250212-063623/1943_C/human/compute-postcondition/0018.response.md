Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, with one list at index `u` now containing the value `[u, v] and an additional element `v`, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is `v-1`**.

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. Initially, the list at index `u` contains `[u, u-1] and an additional element `u-1`. After executing the code, the list at index `u` will now contain `[u, u-1, v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
