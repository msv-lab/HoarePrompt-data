Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0. If `s[i]` equals '>', then `l` is incremented by 1, and depending on the value of `l` relative to `r`:
- If `l < r`, then `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is the value of `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`. If `r` is 0, no additional variables are changed. If `r` is not 0, then `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is set to `A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
- If `s[i]` does not equal '>', then `r` is decremented by 1. If `l` is 0, the postcondition remains as `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.
