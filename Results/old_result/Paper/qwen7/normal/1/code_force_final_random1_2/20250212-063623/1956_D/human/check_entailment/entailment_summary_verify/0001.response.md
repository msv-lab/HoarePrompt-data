### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided program is almost correct but has a minor issue in `func_1` where it unnecessarily appends operations when `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of the solution since the operations are still valid and the sum is maximized correctly.

Upon closer inspection, let's re-evaluate the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is designed to ensure that all elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` are set to the value `r - l + 1`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The logic is correct, but there is indeed a small issue: if `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`, the function should not append `(l, r)` to `ops` because no operation is needed. However, this does not impact the correctness of the overall solution. The operations list will still contain valid operations, and the sum will still be maximized correctly.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case where the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. In this case, it calls `func_1` to set all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - The recursive case where the sum is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` also correctly splits the subarray at the position of the maximum element and recursively maximizes the sum on both sides.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function to maximize the sum.
   - It returns the correct values: the sum of the array and the number of operations.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results correctly.

Given that the operations list will still contain valid operations even if some unnecessary operations are included, the overall correctness of the solution remains intact. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The provided program is correct despite the minor issue in `func_1`.
