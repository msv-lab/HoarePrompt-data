Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l`, and `n` is assigned the value of the next input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the next input integer to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged with their previous values.
