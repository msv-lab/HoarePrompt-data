### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, i.e., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided solution calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty can be achieved by ensuring that the largest element is paired with the smallest element in the sorted array.
   - However, the solution only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences between all consecutive elements. For example, consider the array `[1, 100, 101]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 100, 101]`, and the difference between the largest and smallest elements is `100`. But the actual beauty would be `(100 - 1) + (101 - 100) = 99 + 1 = 100`, which is not captured by simply taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles arrays of different sizes and values within the specified constraints correctly.
   - However, it does not handle the scenario where the array can be rearranged to maximize the sum of differences between all consecutive elements, which is the true goal of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array. It only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not guarantee the maximum possible sum of differences between all consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
