Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`, `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]] = []` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `mp`. The key is `pf[i]`, and the value is an empty list. Since `i` is initially 2, `pf[i]` remains unchanged as it is not specified what `pf[i]` was before, but we know it is not in `mp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
