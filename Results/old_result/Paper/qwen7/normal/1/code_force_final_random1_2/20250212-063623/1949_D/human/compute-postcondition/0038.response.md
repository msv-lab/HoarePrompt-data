Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, `xx` contains the list `[x]`, and `i` and `n` are not explicitly stated but we know the loop starts with `i` set to 1 and runs up to `n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the previous iteration**: Since the loop is iterating over `range(1, n + 1)`, if `i` was at the end of the previous iteration, it would have been `i = n`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = n + 1`. However, since the loop condition checks `i < n + 1`, `i` should be `n` for the current iteration and will be incremented to `n + 1` for the next iteration.

6. **Maintain other states**: All other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`xx` contains the list `[x]`, `i` is `n`, `n` remains unchanged**.

However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only say that `i` will be `n` for the next iteration and will be incremented to `n + 1` for the loop to continue.

So, the final state is:

State: **`xx` contains the list `[x]`, `i` is `n`, `n` remains unchanged**.
