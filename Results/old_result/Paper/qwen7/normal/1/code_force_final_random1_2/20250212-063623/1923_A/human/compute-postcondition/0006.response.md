Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` (if `x` and `y` are valid indices).**

Explanation: The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` slices the string `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`. This means `z` will contain characters from `arr` starting at the first occurrence of '1' (or the start of the string if '1' is not found) up to but not including the position `n - y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless they are modified elsewhere in the code, which is not shown here.
