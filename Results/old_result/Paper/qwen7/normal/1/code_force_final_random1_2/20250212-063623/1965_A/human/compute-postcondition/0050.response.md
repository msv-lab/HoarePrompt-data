Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input.
   - `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l`.
   - If the first element of `lis` is not 1 or the length of `lis` is 1, the condition remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `test` is definitively `False` and `j` is the total number of elements in `lis`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `t` remains the same (unchanged from the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l`. If the first element of `lis` is not 1 or the length of `lis` is 1, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `test` is definitively False and `j` is the total number of elements in `lis`**.
