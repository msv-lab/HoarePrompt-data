Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `n` is equal to `feat[0]`, `i` is `feat[0] + (n - 1) + 1` to ensure it is less than `test_cases`, `n` and `feat` remain the same, and `array2` remains the same as it is constructed inside the loop.**

This means that the variable `n` is now set to the first element of the list `feat`. The variable `i` is calculated as `feat[0] + (n - 1) + 1` to ensure it is less than `test_cases`. The values of `feat`, `n`, and `i` are updated based on the initial state, while `array2` remains unchanged as it is constructed within a loop that hasn't been executed yet.
