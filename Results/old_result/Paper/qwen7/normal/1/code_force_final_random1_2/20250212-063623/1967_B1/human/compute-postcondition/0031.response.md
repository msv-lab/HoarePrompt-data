Output State: **`count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`, `ans` is `ans + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1`, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 3. So, `g` becomes `int(n / 4) - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state and conditions.
