Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on whitespace, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `ar`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was just an input integer in the initial state.
