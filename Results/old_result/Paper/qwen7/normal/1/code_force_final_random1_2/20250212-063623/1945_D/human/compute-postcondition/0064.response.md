Postcondition: `total` is increased by either the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition; `v` is now `na_frente - 2`; and `best` remains unchanged if `v` is not greater than `pos_final`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.
