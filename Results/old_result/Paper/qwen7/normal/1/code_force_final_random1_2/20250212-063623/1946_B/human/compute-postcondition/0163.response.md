Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n` inclusive.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n-1`, we need to ensure that the loop can proceed to `i = 0` and then continue up to `i = n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should start from `0` and go up to `n`.

5. **Consider the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Given that `i` starts at `n-1`, it will execute at least once when `i` is `n-1` and will continue until `i` reaches `n`.

6. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `i` should be set to `0` to start the loop.
   - `n` remains the same but must be valid (i.e., it should be a non-negative integer).

7. **Other states**:
   - `sm` is `-111` and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `smin` is a list containing `n+1` elements, and its values will be updated during the loop iterations, but they do not need to be adjusted here.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`**
