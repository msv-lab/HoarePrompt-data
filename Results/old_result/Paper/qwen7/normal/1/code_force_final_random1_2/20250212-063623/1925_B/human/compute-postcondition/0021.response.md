Postcondition: `x` and `n` are integers, `i` is an integer, and `ans` is an integer. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`. If the condition is not met, `ans` retains its original value and `i` retains its original value.
