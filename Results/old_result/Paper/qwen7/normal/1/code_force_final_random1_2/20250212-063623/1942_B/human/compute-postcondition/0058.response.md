Postcondition: `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `ar`, `n`, `mex`, and `res` remain unchanged.
