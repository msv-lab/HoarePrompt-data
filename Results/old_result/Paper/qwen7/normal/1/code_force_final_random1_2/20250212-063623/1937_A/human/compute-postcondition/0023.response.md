Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - If `n` is 1, the function does nothing.
   - Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 256, `power` is set to 4.
   - If `power` equals `n` after the loop, the function does nothing.
   - Otherwise, `power` remains 5.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n_cases):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i < n_cases`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n_cases`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from the previous value.

6. **Determining the New Value of `n_cases`:**
   - The value of `n_cases` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as the initial value.

7. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n_cases` remains the same.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is an input integer, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 (if previously `i` was 0), otherwise `i` is incremented by 1, `power` remains as it was after the loop execution.**
