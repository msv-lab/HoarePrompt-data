Output State: The `data` array remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by `2 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `idx` will be at its final position, which is the initial `idx` plus `2 * q`. The `results` list will contain 'YES' for each pair `(l, r)` where the conditions `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` are met, and 'NO' otherwise.

The prefix XOR array `pf` and the dictionary `mp` are not modified by the loop itself but are used to determine the outcomes based on the values of `l` and `r` provided in the `data` array during each iteration.
