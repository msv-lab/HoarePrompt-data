Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]`.
2. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - `i`: This is the index variable that increments within the loop.
   - `a[i]`: This is the element at index `i` in list `a`.
   - `b[i]`: This is the corresponding element at index `i` in list `b`.

3. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `i` is initially 0.
   - `b` is a list of integers created from the input string.
   - `new` is a list of length `len(a)` filled with `None` values.
   - `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` filled with `None` values.

4. **Check the loop condition with the initial state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
     - `i < len(a)`
     - `a[i] == b[i]`

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is initially 0, the first condition `i < len(a)` is already satisfied as long as `len(a)` is greater than 0.
   - The second condition `a[i] == b[i]` must be true for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`.

Given this analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted are related to the elements `a[0]` and `b[0]`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `b` is a list of integers created from the input string, `new` is a list of length `len(a)` filled with `None` values, `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` filled with `None` values, and `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`**
