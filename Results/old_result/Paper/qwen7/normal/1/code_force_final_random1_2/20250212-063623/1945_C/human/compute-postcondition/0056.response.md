Output State: **`lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the third element of `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between the current `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The other variables (`lst`, `ele`, and `pk`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
