Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their current values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
