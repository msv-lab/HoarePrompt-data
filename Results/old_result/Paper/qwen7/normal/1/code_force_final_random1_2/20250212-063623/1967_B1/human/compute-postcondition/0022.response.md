Output State: **`count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 3) - 2`**

Explanation: The initial state is `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is `int(n / 3)`. The code `g -= countmins` subtracts `countmins` (which is 2) from `g`. Since `g` was initially `int(n / 3)`, after the operation, `g` becomes `int(n / 3) - 2`. The values of `count` and `countmins` remain unchanged.
