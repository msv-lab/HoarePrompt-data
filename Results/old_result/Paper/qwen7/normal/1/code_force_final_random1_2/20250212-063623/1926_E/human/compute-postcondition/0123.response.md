Output State: `a` is 2, `L` is [], `pow` is 8, `tot` is 6.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `L` will be empty since all elements have been removed during each iteration. The variable `a` takes the value of the last element processed, which is 2. The variable `pow` gets multiplied by 2 in each iteration and ends up being 8 after 3 iterations (starting from 1). The variable `tot` accumulates the sum of all elements in `L`, which is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
