Based on the initial state provided:

- `numTest` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers where:
  - Each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`.
  - Each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by `2 * opNum`.
  - Each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`.
- `stop` is `True`.
- `i` is `n-3`.
- The last two elements of `a` are not equal to 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
