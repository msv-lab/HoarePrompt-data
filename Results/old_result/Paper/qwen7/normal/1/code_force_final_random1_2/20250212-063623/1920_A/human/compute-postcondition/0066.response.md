Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the collection `num`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `num`. For each element `i`:
   - If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num` must have at least one element.
   - `i` will iterate over each element in `num`.
   - If the current value of `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
   - Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented by 1 for each element in `num` that falls within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has just been processed.
   - If `i` was within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` was incremented.
   - The next value of `i` will be the next element in `num`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `num` remains the same as it is an external collection.
   - `i` will be the next element in `num`.
   - `count_num` may or may not have been incremented, but its exact value is not relevant for determining the next state of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `num` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be the next element in `num`.
- The condition for the loop to continue (`i < start` or `i > end`) will be checked against the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`num` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`, and `count_num` is incremented if the current value of `i` is within the range from `start` to `end` inclusive.**
