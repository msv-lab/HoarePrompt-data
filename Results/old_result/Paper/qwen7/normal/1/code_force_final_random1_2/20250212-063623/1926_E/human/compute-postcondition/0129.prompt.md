Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    i = 0
    d = n
    h = n
    p = 1
    g = 0
    if k > (n + 1) // 2:
        while s < k and d > 0:
            s += (d + 1) // 2
            d -= (d + 1) // 2
            i += 1
        while p <= i - 1:
            g += (h + 1) // 2
            h -= (h + 1) // 2
            p += 1
        f = k - g
        y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
        print(y)
    else:
        print(2 * k - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 4 if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `i` is 0. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 4 if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `s` is 0, `d` is 0 if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is 0 if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 3 if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `p` is 1, `g` is 2 * ((n + 1) // 2) if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `g` is 0, and `f` is `k` - 2 * ((n + 1) // 2) if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `f` is not defined, `y` is \(2^{(4 - 1)} * (2 * (`k` - 2 * ((n + 1) // 2)) - 1)\) if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `y` is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is updated to the first input integer, `k` is updated to the second input integer, `s` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is equal to `i`, which is `n`, `g` is 0, and either `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\) with `f` being `k - g`, `s` being the sum of \((d + 1) // 2\) added in each iteration until `d` becomes 0, `d` being 0, `h` being 0, `p` being `i`, which is `n`, `g` being the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration where `h` was greater than 0, and `y` being \(2^{(n - 1)} * (2 * (k - g) - 1)\), or `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2` with all variables retaining their initial values except `d` and `h` being 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `i`, `d` is 0, `h` is reduced to 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series \((n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + ... + 1\), `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times (k - g) - 1)\) if `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
