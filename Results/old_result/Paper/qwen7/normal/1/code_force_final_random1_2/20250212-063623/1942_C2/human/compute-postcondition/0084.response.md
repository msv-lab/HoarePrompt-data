Postcondition: **`len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is either 3 or 4, if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise `ans` is updated based on whether `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and the value of `y`. If the condition is met, `y` is decreased by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, otherwise `ans` and `y` remain unchanged.**
