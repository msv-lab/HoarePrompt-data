Output State: **`freq[prob - 'A']` is incremented by 1, `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is also incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency count of the character `prob` in the list `freq`. Since `prob` is the next element in `a`, the expression `prob - 'A'` and `ord(prob) - ord('A')` both refer to the same index in the `freq` list. Therefore, incrementing one will increment the other as well.
