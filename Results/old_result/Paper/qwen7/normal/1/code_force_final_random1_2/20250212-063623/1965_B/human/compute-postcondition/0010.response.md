Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `2`, and `l`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `l` (exclusive). This means `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `l-1`.

3. **Determine the Initial Values Needed**:
   - `i` must start at 2 for the loop to begin its first iteration.
   - `l` must be greater than 2 for the loop to run at all, since the loop starts at 2 and goes up to `l-1`.

4. **Check the Given States**:
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.
   - `ans` is [2, 3].
   - `n` is not equal to 2.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` must start at 2, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 2.
   - Since `l` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `l` is greater than 2.

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `l`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `l` is greater than 2**
