Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) integers representing the number of stones in each of the n piles (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, then for each of those test cases, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints.
