Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a`, and `b` are updated to new integer values from user input.**

Explanation: The code `winner = func_1(a, b)` does not change the initial state of `t`, `a`, `b`, `winner`, or `results`. It only updates `winner` to the result of calling the function `func_1(a, b)`. Since the values of `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from user input, they are no longer the original input integers. However, the initial conditions and the structure of the variables remain the same as described in the initial state.
