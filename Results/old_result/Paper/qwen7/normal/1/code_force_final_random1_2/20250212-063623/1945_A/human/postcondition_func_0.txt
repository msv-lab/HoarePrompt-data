The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it updates the count of extroverts by adding the count of universals and then calculates and prints a result based on the adjusted counts of introverts and extroverts. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
