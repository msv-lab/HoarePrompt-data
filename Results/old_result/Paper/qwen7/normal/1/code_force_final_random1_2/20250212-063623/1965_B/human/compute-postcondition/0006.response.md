Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases returned by `func_10()`. For each iteration, `func_14()` will be called, returning a list `[n, k]`. The standard output (`sys.stdout`) will write the string representation of this list followed by a newline character. This process will repeat until all `t` test cases have been processed.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the standard output will contain the list `[n, k]` for each test case, with each list on a new line. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases, which is determined by the function `func_10()`.
