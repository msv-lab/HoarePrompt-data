Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `lst` must be empty, `mini` will hold the minimum value among `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in the original `lst`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`, updating `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. Since `lst` initially contains indices where a certain condition was met, and the loop processes each element in `lst`, `mini` will eventually hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element that was originally in `lst`. Once all elements in `lst` have been processed, `lst` will be empty because each element is removed as it is processed.
