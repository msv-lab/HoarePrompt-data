Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `power` must be less than `n`; `power` is increased by 1.**

The value of `power` is incremented by 1, but since the initial conditions state that `n` must be greater than 1 and `power` must be less than `n`, these conditions remain valid after the code execution.
