Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the new input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`**.

Explanation: The code `lis = sorted(set(l))` sorts the unique elements of the map object `l` and assigns the result to `lis`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The output state includes all the variables with their respective values or expressions they are equal to.
