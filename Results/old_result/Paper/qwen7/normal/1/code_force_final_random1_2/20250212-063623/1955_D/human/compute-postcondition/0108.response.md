Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0; `cnt_b` is a dictionary with key `0` and value `0`, and key `1` and value `0`; `cnt_b[2]` is `0`**.

Explanation: The line `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b[2]` to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
