Output State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i_new]`, `i` is `i_new`, and `2 * n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Since `i` is initially set to `i_new`, the value added to `score` is `l[i_new]`. The value of `i` remains `i_new` after the operation, and `2 * n` remains unchanged as no operations affect it.
