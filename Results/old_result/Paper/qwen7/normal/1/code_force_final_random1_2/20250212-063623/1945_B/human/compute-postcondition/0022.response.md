Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from input, `b` is the second integer from input, `m` is the third integer from input, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, then no change occurs. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
