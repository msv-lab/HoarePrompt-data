Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `i + 1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `1 <= i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range `[1, n-2]`. Since `i` starts at `i + 1`, the smallest possible value for `i` is `1` (if `i + 1 = 1` implies `i = 0`, but since `i` starts from `i + 1`, the smallest valid starting point is `1`).
   - `n` must be greater than `1` because the loop requires `i` to be less than `n - 1`.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`j`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `1` (since `i` starts from `i + 1` and the loop requires `i` to be at least `1`).
- `n` must be greater than `1` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
