Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the new input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then `j` is equal to the length of `lis`, `test` is True, and the loop has either printed 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1'. This holds regardless of whether the length of `lis` is odd or even.**
