Postcondition: `aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, and `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes > newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0.
