Postcondition: `i` is 4, `idx` is 5, `a` is a list with an element at index 4 equal to 4, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ 4`, if `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` becomes an empty list and `mp[pf[3]]` contains the value 3, `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ 4`, and if `pf[i]` (which is `pf[4]`) is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[4]]` becomes an empty list.
