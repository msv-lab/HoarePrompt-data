Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the range `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 2`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1`, meaning the previous value of `i` was `i`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`. Therefore, `i + 2` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that can be adjusted based on the loop head are `i` and the condition related to `i`. The grid `gr` and the flag `impossible` remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop is met.

5. **Formulate the New State**: Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`. We need to ensure that `i + 2` is less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`gr` is a grid, `impossible` remains `False`, and `i` is `i + 2`**.
