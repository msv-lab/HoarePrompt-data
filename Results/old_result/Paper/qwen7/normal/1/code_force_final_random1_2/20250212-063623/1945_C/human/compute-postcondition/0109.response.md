Output State: **`zero` is increased by 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `zero` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to '0' for at least one index `i`, `zero` now holds the updated count. The value of `i` is also incremented, so `(i + 1)` is used in the calculation. The output state includes the updated value of `zero` and the calculation of `zero_perc`.
