Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split**.

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with a leading zero and appends integers obtained from the input split. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state as they are not used in the given code snippet.
