The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d` (a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers), `processing` (a list of length equal to the maximum key in `d`, containing only 0s and 1s indicating whether a node has been processed), `da` (an integer representing a key in the dictionary `d`), and `rank` (a list of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d`, initialized to 0s).

The function returns either 1 or the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a processing list, an integer `da`, and a rank list. It returns either 1 or the value of `rank[da - 1]` which is `tmp + 1`.**
