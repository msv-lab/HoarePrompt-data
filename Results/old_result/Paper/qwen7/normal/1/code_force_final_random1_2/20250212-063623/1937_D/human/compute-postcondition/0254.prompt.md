You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    A = []
    idx_A = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if s[i] == '>':
            if len(idx_A) == 0:
                A.append(0)
            else:
                x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
                A.append(x)
            idx_A.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will be such that `i` is equal to `n-1`, meaning the loop has iterated through all indices of the string `s`. The variable `A` will contain a series of integers where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, each element in `A` will be the sum of the previous element in `A` plus `(current_index - last_index_in_idx_A) * length_of_idx_A` if the current character in `s` is '>', or it will simply be the previous value of `A` if the current character is not '>'. The list `idx_A` will contain all the indices of the string `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state will be characterized by `i` being equal to the length of the string `s` minus one, `A` being a list of integers calculated according to the rules described above, and `idx_A` being a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear.
    B = []
    idx_B = []
    for j in range(0, n):
        i = n - 1 - j
        
        if s[i] == '<':
            if len(idx_B) == 0:
                B.append(0)
            else:
                x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
                B.append(x)
            idx_B.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and now `idx_B` contains all the indices `i` where `s[i] == '<'`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached `n-1` (since it starts from `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until `j` reaches `n`). The variable `j` will be 4 because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The conditions for `n` being greater than 0 and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain as described, with `idx_B` containing all indices where the character in `s` is '<'.
