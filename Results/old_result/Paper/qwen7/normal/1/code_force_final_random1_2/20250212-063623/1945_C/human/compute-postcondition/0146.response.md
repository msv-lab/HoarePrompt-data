Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`.
   - `final` contains the first element of `lst`.
   - `lst` contains at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `lst`, at the end of each iteration, `lst` will have one less element.
   - `mini` will be updated based on the new value of `elem` and the remaining elements in `lst`.
   - `final` remains unchanged as it still holds the first element of the original `lst`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `lst` will now contain all elements except the first one (since the loop iterates over each element).
   - `mini` will be updated based on the new set of elements in `lst`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `mini` will be updated based on the new set of elements in `lst`.
- `final` remains the same as it still holds the first element of the original `lst`.
- `lst` will now contain all elements except the first one.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst` (excluding the first element), `final` contains the first element of `lst`, `lst` contains at least one element (excluding the first element)**.
