Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i - 2`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is `k - (i - 2) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - i + 1` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `i - 2` from it and then adding 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition `if k < i - 1` is not evaluated here, so the return or function call part is not affected by this line of code.
