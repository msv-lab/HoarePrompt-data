Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `i` is 1, and `score` is the original score plus `l[0]`. Note that `score` and `l[0]` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `i < 2 * n`. Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `1 < 2 * n` or equivalently `2 * n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 (as per the loop step). Therefore, `i` will become 3. Also, since `i` is now 3, the condition `i < 2 * n` must still hold true, meaning `2 * n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Final state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Thus, the new state should reflect `i` being 3 and `n` being such that `2 * n > 3`.

State: **`i` is 3, `score` is the original score plus `l[0]`, `n` must be greater than 1.5**
