Output State: **`suf` is a list where the last element is updated to `suf[i] + l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends a new element to the list `suf`. This new element is the sum of the current last element of `suf` (`suf[i]`) and the corresponding element from the list `l` (`l[i]`). The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
