Output State: **`total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is calculated based on `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`; `resultats` is either `[-1]` if `egalites < 0`, or a list containing one element which is `egalites // 2` if `egalites >= 0`.**

This output state reflects the changes and conditions specified in the code snippet. The variables `total_points`, `egalites`, `p3`, and `resultats` are updated based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The precondition that `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs` remains unchanged, and the calculation of `egalites` and `resultats` is based on the new `total_points`.
