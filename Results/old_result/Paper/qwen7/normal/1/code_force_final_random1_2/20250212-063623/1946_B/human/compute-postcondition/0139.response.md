Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `suf` is a list with its first three elements being `suf[0] + b[0]`, `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1]`, and `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1] + l[1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `suf`. The new element is calculated as `suf[i] + l[i]`, where `i` is 2. Since `suf` initially had its first two elements as `suf[0] + b[0]` and `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1]`, the third element is `suf[2] + b[2]`, which simplifies to `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1] + b[2]` because `suf[2]` is `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1]`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
