The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is still 0 (the first iteration) and `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 1 (since it is incremented by 1).
- `n` must remain greater than 0.

Given the postconditions and the initial state, the only thing that changes is the value of `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`.**
