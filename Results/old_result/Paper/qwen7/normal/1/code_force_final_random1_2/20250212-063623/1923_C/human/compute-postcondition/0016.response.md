Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the new first element of the list `l`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of the new `x`, `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`**.

In this case, the code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1.
