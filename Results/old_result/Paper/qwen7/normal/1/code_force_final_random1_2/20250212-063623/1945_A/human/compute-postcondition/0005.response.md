Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the first part to an integer, `c` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the last part to an integer, and the string `s` is split into three parts to form `a`, `b`, and `c`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` into parts using the `split()` method, which divides the string into substrings based on whitespace by default. These substrings are then converted to integers and assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The original values of `b` and `c` are not specified, but it is mentioned that `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `c` are updated based on the split and conversion process, while `t` remains unchanged and the relationship between `b` and its original value plus `c` is preserved.
