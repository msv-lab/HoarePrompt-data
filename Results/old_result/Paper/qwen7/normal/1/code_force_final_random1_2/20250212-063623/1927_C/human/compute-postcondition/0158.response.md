Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` becomes 1 and `bOnes` remains 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0 and `bOnes` becomes 1. Additionally, `i` is in both lists `a` and `b`, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `k` is at least 2.**
