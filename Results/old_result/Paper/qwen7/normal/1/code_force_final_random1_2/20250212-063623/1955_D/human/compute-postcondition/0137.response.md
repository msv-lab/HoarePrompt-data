Output State: **`curr` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Since `a`, `i`, `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The only variable that has been updated is `curr`, which is now increased by 1 from its previous value.
