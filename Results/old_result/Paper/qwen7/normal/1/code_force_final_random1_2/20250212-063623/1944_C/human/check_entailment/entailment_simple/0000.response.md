### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided seems to have some irrelevant functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not used in solving the problem.
   - The relevant part of the code is the `func_1` function, which processes the input array `arr` using a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number.
   - The logic in `func_1` iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks if they are present in the `Counter`. If a number is present, it is marked as visited and removed from the `Counter`. The process continues until a number is not found, at which point the smallest missing number is printed.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Given the constraints and the nature of the game, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob can be deduced as follows:
     - Alice will try to fill `c` with as many unique numbers as possible.
     - Bob will try to remove numbers that prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
   - The key observation is that if all numbers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `a`, the MEX will be `n` (since all numbers from 0 to `n-1` are in `c`). However, since `a` only contains numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the MEX will be the smallest number not present in `a`.

4. **Code Verification**:
   - The code correctly identifies the smallest missing number in the array `arr` by iterating through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checking their presence in the `Counter`.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the smallest missing number is printed, which aligns with the optimal strategy for the game.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest missing number in the array `arr`, which is equivalent to finding the MEX of the array `c` under the given game rules. Therefore, the code is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
