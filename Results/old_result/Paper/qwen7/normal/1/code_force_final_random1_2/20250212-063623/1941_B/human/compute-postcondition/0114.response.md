Output State: **`a[i]` is decremented by `opNum`, `stop` is True, and `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `opNum`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` decrements the value of `a[i]` by the value of `opNum`. The value of `opNum` is assigned from `a[i]` before the decrement operation. The value of `stop` remains `True` and the value of `a[i + 2]` is also decremented by `opNum`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
