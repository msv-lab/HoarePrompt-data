Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is satisfied, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true. If `x % i == 0` is true and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` are also true, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of 3 and `x // i`, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true, if `x % i == 0` and `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` hold. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum of 3 and `2`, `x` remains unchanged, and the conditions remain as in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
