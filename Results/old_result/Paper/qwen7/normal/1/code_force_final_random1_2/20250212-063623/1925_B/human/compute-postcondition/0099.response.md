Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `i` if the condition `x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0` is true. If the condition is false, `i` is still the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.
