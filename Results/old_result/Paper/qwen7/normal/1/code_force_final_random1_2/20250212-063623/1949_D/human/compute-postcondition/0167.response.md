Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'.

This postcondition summarizes both cases: if `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is set to 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is set to 'S'. Both scenarios maintain that `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remains as '?'.
