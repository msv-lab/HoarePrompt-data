The code `total_matchs = total_points // 2` assigns the value of `total_points // 2` to `total_matchs`. This means that `total_matchs` now holds the same value as before, which is `total_points // 2`. The other variables (`total_points`, `egalites`, `resultats`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is either `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` with `resultats` containing two `-1`, or `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` with `resultats` being a list containing `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2` and `-1`.**
