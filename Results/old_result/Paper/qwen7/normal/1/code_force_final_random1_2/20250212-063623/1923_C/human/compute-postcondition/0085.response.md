Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next integer in the list, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j + 1` and `c` has appended `j + 1`.**

This means that the list `c` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `j + 1` after `j` was incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
