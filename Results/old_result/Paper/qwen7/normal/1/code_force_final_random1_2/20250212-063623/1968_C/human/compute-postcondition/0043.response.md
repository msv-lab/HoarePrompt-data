To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation process step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` elements.
   - Each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[j] = 1000 + sum(x[k] for k in range(j))`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - For `j = 0`, `a[0] = 1000 + sum(x[k] for k in range(0)) = 1000 + 0 = 1000`.
   - For `j = 1`, `a[1] = 1000 + sum(x[k] for k in range(1)) = 1000 + x[0]`.
   - For `j = 2`, `a[2] = 1000 + sum(x[k] for k in range(2)) = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.
   - And so on, until `j = n-1`, `a[n-1] = 1000 + sum(x[k] for k in range(n-1)) = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2])`.

3. **Final List `a`**:
   - The list `a` will contain `n` elements where:
     - `a[0] = 1000 + 0 = 1000`
     - `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
     - `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
     - ...
     - `a[n-1] = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2])`

4. **Printing the List**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Given this understanding, the output will be the list `a` with each element separated by a space.

Output: **1000 1000+x[0] 1000+x[0]+x[1] ... 1000+(x[0]+x[1]+...+x[n-2])**
