Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `m` is updated to be the second integer entered through input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers entered through input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `n` is the first integer entered through input, `l` is a list of integers split from the input, `p` is now `[0]`, `c` is now `[0]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `i` and `j` to 0. This does not affect the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `n`, `l`, `p`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
