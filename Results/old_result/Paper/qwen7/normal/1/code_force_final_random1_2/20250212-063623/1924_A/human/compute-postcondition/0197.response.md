Postcondition: **All characters of the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \(2^k - 1\), and `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**
