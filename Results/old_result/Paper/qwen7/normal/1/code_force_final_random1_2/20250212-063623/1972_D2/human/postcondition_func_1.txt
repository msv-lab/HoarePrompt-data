The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `t` (representing the number of remaining test cases) is still greater than 0. The function does not return any value but modifies the state of `t` to reflect the number of remaining test cases.
