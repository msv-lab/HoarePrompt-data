Output State: **`x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the new value of `i + 1`. All other variables retain their initial states.
