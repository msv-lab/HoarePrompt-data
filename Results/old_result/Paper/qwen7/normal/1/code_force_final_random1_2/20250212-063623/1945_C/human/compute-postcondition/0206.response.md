Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 3 or 2 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is now `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one` is undefined, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is either greater than or equal to 50 or a specific value, and `lst` contains 2, 2, `one_perc` remains undefined, `one_perc` is recalculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` but `one` and `o` are undefined, so the calculation cannot be performed.**

In this case, the code attempts to calculate `one_perc` using `o` and `one`, but since `o` and `one` are undefined, the calculation cannot be completed. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
