### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function is responsible for setting a subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`.
- The base case is when `l == r`, and if `a[l]` is not 0, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and records the operation.
- The recursive call ensures that the subarray from `l + 1` to `r` is processed next.
- The main logic in `func_1` is to ensure that the subarray from `l` to `r` is set to `r - l + 1`.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- This function is designed to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
- It checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the length of the subarray.
- If the condition holds, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
- Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right segments until the condition is met.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
- It then returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result along with the operations.

#### Analysis:
1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the array length is small (up to 18). The recursive approach ensures that all subarrays are processed.
2. **Maximizing Sum**: The program correctly identifies segments of the array that can be set to their maximum possible value to maximize the sum.
3. **Operations Recording**: The program records all operations performed, ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraint of using no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the array sum is maximized by setting appropriate segments to their maximum possible values.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying issues, but the program has been refined to address those issues. After re-evaluating the program with the provided annotations and the problem requirements, the program is now correct.

**Final: True**
