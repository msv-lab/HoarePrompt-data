The function modifies a list of non-negative integers `a` based on the indices `l` and `r`. If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `a[l]` is zero; if not, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation. Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l` to `r`, setting all elements within this range to `r - l + 1` and recording the operation. The function does not return any value.
