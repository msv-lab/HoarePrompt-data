You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5 and calculates the sum of its digits. It then returns this sum. However, if the initial value of `num` is 0, the function returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the array `A` is precomputed and reused for each test case, which leads to incorrect results for different values of `n`. 

The precomputed array `A` is generated up to 200,000, but the problem statement specifies that the input `n` can be up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\), which means the precomputed array is sufficient. However, the issue lies in how the precomputed sums are used.

For each test case, the program directly accesses `A[n - 1]`, which gives the sum of the numbers after digit sum transformation for all numbers from 1 to `n`. This approach works for small values of `n`, but it fails to handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 10, because the precomputed array starts from index 1 (i.e., `A[0]` is not defined).

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- For `n = 1`, the correct sum should be `1` (since the digit sum of 1 is 1).
- Using the precomputed array, `A[0]` is not defined, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 10 correctly, making it incorrect.
