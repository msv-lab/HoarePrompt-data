Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer.**

The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000 remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still within this range, and `n` is set to the integer value entered by the user.
