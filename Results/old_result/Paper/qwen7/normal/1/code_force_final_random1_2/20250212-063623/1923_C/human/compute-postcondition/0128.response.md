Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed minus 1, `l` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `p` is now `[0, 1]`, `c` is now `[0]`, and `x` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` was `[0]`. After appending `i`, `p` becomes `[0, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
