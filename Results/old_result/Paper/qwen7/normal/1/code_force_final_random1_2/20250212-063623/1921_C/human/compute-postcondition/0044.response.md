Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` means `i` takes values from `1` to `n-1`).

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `feat[0] + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than `feat[0] + 1`

4. **Loop Body Analysis**:
   - The loop body checks if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.
   - If true, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.
   - Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `feat[0] + 2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `feat[0] + 2` for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to `feat[0] + 2`.
   - `n` must remain greater than `feat[0] + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 2`, `n` must be greater than `feat[0] + 2`**.
