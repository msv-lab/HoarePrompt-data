Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except `i` which is equal to `n-1`, `lst` contains all indices from 2 to `n` where the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` was met, `zero` equals the total count of '0's in `sl`, `one` equals the total count of '1's in `sl`, and `o` equals the initial count of '1's in `sl`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, meaning the loop has iterated through all possible indices up to `n-1`. The list `lst` will contain all indices from 2 to `n` where the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` was satisfied during the loop's execution. The variable `zero` will hold the total count of '0's found in the list `sl`, while `one` will hold the total count of '1's. The variable `o` will retain its initial value as it was set to `n/2` and is not modified within the loop.
