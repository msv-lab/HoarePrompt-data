Output State: **`total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is calculated based on `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `-1` to the list `resultats`. Since `resultats` was either `[-1]` if `egalites < 0` or a list containing `egalites // 2` if `egalites >= 0`, appending `-1` to it results in `resultats` being `[-1]`. The other variables (`total_points`, `egalites`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `total_matchs`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
