Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer, `c` is the integer value of the last part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer, and `s` is the next line of input from the input stream; `b` is increased by `c`.**

Explanation: The code `b += c` increments the value of `b` by `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
