Output State: **`a` is 3, `L` is [3, 2], `pow` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2, but its initial value is not specified in the initial state. Since no initial value for `pow` is given, we cannot determine its exact value before the operation. However, after executing `pow *= 2`, `pow` is set to 2. The other variables (`a` and `L`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
