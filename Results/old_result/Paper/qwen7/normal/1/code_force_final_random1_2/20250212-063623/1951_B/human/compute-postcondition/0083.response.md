To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans1` is the total number of elements in the list `s` that are not equal to `h` and do not cause the loop to break when found to be greater than `h`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(max(ans, ans1))
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `ans1` is already defined as per the given conditions. However, there is no mention of `ans` in the initial state. This implies that `ans` might be an undefined variable or it could be a different value that is not relevant to the calculation of `ans1`.

Given that the code snippet only involves printing `max(ans, ans1)`, and since `ans1` is explicitly defined, the `max` function will compare `ans` (which is undefined in the context of the initial state) with `ans1`.

Since `ans` is not defined in the initial state, it will be treated as `None` or `0` in the context of this comparison unless otherwise specified. Therefore, the `max` function will essentially return `ans1` because `None` or `0` will be considered smaller than any positive integer.

Thus, the output will be `ans1`.

Output: **ans1**
