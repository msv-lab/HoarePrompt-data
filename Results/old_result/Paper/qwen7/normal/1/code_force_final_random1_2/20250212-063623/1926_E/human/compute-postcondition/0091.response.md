Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3, `m` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. Since `n` is a non-zero value but its exact value is not specified, `m` will be the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The other variables (`a`, `L`, `pow`, `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
