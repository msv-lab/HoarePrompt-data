Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2\), `m` is \(15 * z - y * 4\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` using the formula `m = 15 * z - y * 4`. Here, `z` is already defined as `(y + 1) // 2`. Since `x` and `y` are inputs, their values remain unchanged. `t`, `a`, `i`, and `z` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables and the updated value of `m`.
