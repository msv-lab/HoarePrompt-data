Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and the initial state of `n` and `k` and the list `a` remains unchanged
Code of the loop:
for j in range(t):
    b = input().split()
    n = int(b[0])
    k = int(b[1])
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    suf = []
    suf.append(0)
    for i in range(n):
        suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])
    smin = [0]
    for i in range(n):
        if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
            smin.append(suf[i + 1])
        else:
            smin.append(smin[i])
    sm = -111
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
            sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
    sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm
    sm += suf[n]
    if sm < 0:
        a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)
        sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)
    else:
        sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)
    print(sm)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\) or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), depending on whether `sm` is less than 0. If `sm` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is less than 0), or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is greater than or equal to 0). The value of `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and `sm` is either equal to `a * 10` if `sm < 0` or `4 % 10` if `sm >= 0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
