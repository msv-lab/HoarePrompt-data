Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, `smin` is a list where the last element is now equal to `smin[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is 1, the value appended to `smin` is `smin[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the last element of `smin` is updated to `smin[1]`.
