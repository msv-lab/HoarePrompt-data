### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the given program, including incorrect condition checks and calculations. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Function Summaries Recap
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Processes up to 10,000 test cases, calls `func_1()` for each test case, and ensures the variable `t` (number of remaining test cases) is still greater than 0.

#### Re-evaluation of `func_1`
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
2. **Nested Loops**: It uses a nested loop where `x` iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`.
   - For each `x`, it initializes `y` to 1.
   - It checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - It calculates the GCD of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
   - If the GCD is 1, it adds the minimum of `n / ((x + y) \cdot x)` and `m // ((x + y) \cdot y)` to `cnt`.

#### Issues Identified
1. **Condition Check**: The condition \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) does not ensure that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
2. **Calculation**: The calculation `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is irrelevant to the problem.
3. **Algorithmic Approach**: The current approach does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the required condition.

#### Correct Solution
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.
2. Check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Function calls for testing
# func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The corrected version iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the required condition.

Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
