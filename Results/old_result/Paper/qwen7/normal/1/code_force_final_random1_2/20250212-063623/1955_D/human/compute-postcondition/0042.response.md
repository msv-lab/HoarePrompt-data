Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `i` is equal to `m - 1`, `m` remains the same, for each element `b[i]` in the list `b`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is decremented by 1 for every occurrence of `b[i]` in the list `a` where `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative, and `curr` is the total count of such occurrences. Additionally, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `m`, `b`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain consistent with their previous states, except that `curr` is now updated to reflect the total count of occurrences as described.
