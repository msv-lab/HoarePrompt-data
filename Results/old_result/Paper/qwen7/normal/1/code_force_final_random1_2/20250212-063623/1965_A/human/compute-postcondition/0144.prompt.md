Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each of the n piles, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l`. If the first element of `lis` is not 1 or the length of `lis` is 1, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `test` is definitively False and `j` is the total number of elements in `lis`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the function does not make any additional changes to `test`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, with `j` being equal to the length of `lis`, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and the value of `test` remains False. Additionally, if the length of `lis` is odd or even, no specific changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the new input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then `j` is equal to the length of `lis`, `test` is True, and the loop has either printed 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1'. This holds regardless of whether the length of `lis` is odd or even.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
