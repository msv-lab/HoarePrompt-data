Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `k` and `best` are not defined in the initial state, so their values cannot be determined precisely. Therefore, they will be represented as `k` and `best` in the output.

Output: **? k best k 2**
