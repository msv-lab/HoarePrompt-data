Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

The code simply reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is already the current value of `m`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, and `m` remain unchanged.
