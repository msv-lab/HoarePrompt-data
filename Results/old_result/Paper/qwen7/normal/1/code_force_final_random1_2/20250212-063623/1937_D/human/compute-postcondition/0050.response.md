Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and now `idx_B` includes the index `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `idx_B.append(i)` appends the current index `i` to the list `idx_B`. Initially, `j` was 1, so after the first iteration, `j` became 2. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, and the only change is the addition of the current index `i` to the list `idx_B`.
