### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
     - Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times.
     - Output: `Yes` (Correct)
   - **Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
     - Nikita can only end up with either 0 or 2 cubes.
     - Output: `No` (Correct)
   - **Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
     - Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times and remove 1 cube once.
     - Output: `Yes` (Correct)

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - The logic checks several conditions to determine if `m` cubes can be obtained after `n` moves:
     - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
     - If `m > n`, it prints "No".
     - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
     - If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
     - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - `n == m`: This condition correctly handles the case where the number of moves equals the number of cubes.
   - `m > n`: This condition correctly handles the case where the desired number of cubes exceeds the number of moves.
   - `m == n - 1`: This condition correctly handles the case where the desired number of cubes is one less than the number of moves.
   - Both `m` and `n` being even or both being odd: These conditions are unnecessary because they do not affect the possibility of obtaining `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key is whether `m` can be achieved within `n` moves.

4. **Simplified Logic**:
   - The program can be simplified by removing the conditions related to the parity of `m` and `n`. The correct conditions are:
     - `n == m`
     - `m > n`
     - `m == n - 1`

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow of the program.
   - The final output is determined by the values of `n` and `m` from the last iteration, which matches the expected behavior.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the program logic is almost correct but can be simplified.
   - The current logic, although slightly redundant, still produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct, even though it can be simplified. The current logic accurately determines whether it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the provided conditions.
