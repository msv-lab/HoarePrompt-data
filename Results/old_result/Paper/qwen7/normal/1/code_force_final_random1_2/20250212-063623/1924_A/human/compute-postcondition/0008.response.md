Output State: **`cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')` to `cur_ss`. Here, `ord('a')` returns the Unicode code point of the character 'a', which is a constant value. Therefore, `cur_ss` is directly calculated as the difference between the Unicode code point of the character stored in `ss` and the Unicode code point of 'a'. No other variables are affected.
