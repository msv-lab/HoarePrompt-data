Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with its first character removed, `cur` is incremented by \(1 << cur_ss\), `cur_ss` is equal to the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by \(1 << cur_ss\). Here, `cur_ss` is defined as the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The values of `cnt` and `ans` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged. The initial state of `s` (a non-empty string with its first character removed) and the value of `cur_ss` are updated according to the new value of `cur_ss`.
