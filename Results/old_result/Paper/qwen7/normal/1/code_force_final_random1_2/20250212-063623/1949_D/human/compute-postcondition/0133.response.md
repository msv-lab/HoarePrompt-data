Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers where the current value of `a[i]` is now greater than 0, `b` is a list of integers where the current value of `b[i]` remains greater than 0, `sa` is a list containing the integers 1, 3, `sb` is a list containing the integer 1. If `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `sa` is updated to contain the integers 1, 3.
