Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is -1
   - `n - m` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - The current value of `a[i]` is either in `b_values` or not
   - If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and is now greater than or equal to 0
   - If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `i` remains -1 and no changes are made to `cnt_b`
   - The condition `(a[i + m] in b_values)` is true if the if part executes, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now greater than or equal to 0
   - If the else part executes, no changes are made to `cnt_b` and the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - m):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from -1 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - m`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is -1
- `n - m` must be greater than 0 (this does not change as it is an invariant condition)

Since `i` is -1, the next value of `i` would be 0. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n - m`. Therefore, `n - m` must still be greater than 0.

If the loop executes, `i` will become 0. We need to check the conditions inside the loop:
- If `a[0]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[0]]` will be incremented by 1 and will be greater than or equal to 0.
- If `a[0]` is not in `b_values`, `i` remains -1 and no changes are made to `cnt_b`.
- The condition `(a[0 + m] in b_values)` will be checked, and if true, `cnt_b[a[0 + m]]` will be incremented by 1 and will be greater than or equal to 0.

However, since we are only adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the loop head variables.

**Final State:**
- `i` will be 0
- `n - m` must still be greater than 0

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n - m` must be greater than 0**
