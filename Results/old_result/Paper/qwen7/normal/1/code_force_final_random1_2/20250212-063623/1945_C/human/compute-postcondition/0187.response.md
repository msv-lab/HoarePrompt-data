Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be at least 2, and if `s[0]` is '0', then `zero` is 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `zero_perc` is assigned the value of `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `zero` is either 1 or 0 (based on the initial state), `i` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be at least 2, the value of `zero_perc` will be either 0 or 100 depending on the value of `zero` and `i`. The first character of `s` being '0' or not does not affect the calculation of `zero_perc`, so it remains unchanged.
