Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `x`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still `n-1` from the initial state.
