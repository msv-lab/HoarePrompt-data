Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `balance` is either 2 or 1; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being equal to the current value of `balance` + 1, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the second or third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false.**

Explanation: The line `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Since `balance` was initially either 1 or 0, after the increment, it will be either 2 or 1 respectively. The values of `i`, `n`, and `balance_info` remain unchanged.
