Output State: **`sm` is equal to 2 + `suf[n]`**

Explanation: The initial value of `sm` is 2. The code `sm += suf[n]` adds the value of `suf[n]` to the current value of `sm`. Since the exact value of `suf[n]` is not provided, it remains as `suf[n]`. Therefore, the updated value of `sm` is the sum of its initial value (2) and the value of `suf[n]`.
