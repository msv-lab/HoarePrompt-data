Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing the integer 1.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `sa` will contain all positions where the character `'F'` has appeared at least once but the character `'S'` has never appeared at that position, and `sb` will still only contain the integer 1.
