Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000**.

The code initializes the variable `mini` to the value of \(10^8\), which is represented as `100000000`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
