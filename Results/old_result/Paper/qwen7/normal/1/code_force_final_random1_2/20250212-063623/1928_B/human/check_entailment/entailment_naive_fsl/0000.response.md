Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The functions defined (func_1 to func_9) do not perform any operations related to the problem description. Specifically, the task requires processing an array to find the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. However, none of the functions provided actually perform this task. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
