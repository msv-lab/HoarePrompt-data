Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to the minimum value in the list `ar` (since `mex` is continuously updated to `mex - ar[i]` until the end of the loop), `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `i` is `-1` (since the loop runs in reverse from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`). All elements in `res` are filled based on the final value of `mex` and the values in `ar`.
