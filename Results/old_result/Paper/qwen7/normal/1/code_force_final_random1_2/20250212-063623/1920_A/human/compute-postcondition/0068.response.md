Output State: **`count_num` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in `num`, and `num` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `i` remains as the next element in `num`, and `num` still has at least one element.
