To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial State**: The statement `print(best)` is executed after all iterations of the loop have been completed. This implies that `best` is a variable that has been updated during the loop iterations.

2. **Variable `best`**: Since no specific initialization or update logic for `best` is provided, we need to infer from the context that `best` likely holds the best value found during the loop iterations. Without further details on how `best` is updated, we can only assume it holds the optimal value determined by the loop.

Given the lack of explicit information about the loop or the updates to `best`, the most precise description we can provide is that `best` holds the value that was determined to be the best during the loop iterations.

Output: **best (where best is the optimal value determined during the loop iterations)**
