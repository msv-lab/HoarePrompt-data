Functionality: **The function processes a series of constraints and a list of integers. It identifies the minimum value (`start`) from constraints of type 1 and the maximum value (`end`) from constraints of type 2. It then counts how many integers in the provided list (`num`) fall within the range `[start, end]`. If the range is invalid (i.e., `start` is greater than `end`), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the difference between the range size (`end - start + 1`) and the count of integers within the range, returning 0 if this difference is non-positive.**
