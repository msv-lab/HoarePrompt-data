Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n-1`.
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 2.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it executes, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2 and `n` is greater than 2, the condition `i < n` is satisfied.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - The variable `i` will be updated to `2`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
