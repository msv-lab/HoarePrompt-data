Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `i` is `n-4`, `opNum` is equal to `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i+2]` is decreased by `opNum`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` decreases the value of `a[i + 2]` by `opNum`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. The updated value of `a[i + 2]` is now `a[i + 2] - opNum`.
