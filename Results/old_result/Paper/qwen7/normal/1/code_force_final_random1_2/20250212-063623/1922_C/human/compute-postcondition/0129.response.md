Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an integer from the input split.
   - `y` is an integer from the input split.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j < m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m`.
   - Given that `j` is now 2, the loop will continue if `2 < m`.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `m` is an input integer, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split**.
