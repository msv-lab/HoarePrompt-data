Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive element in `a` from index 1 to the last index.

In this final state, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of `a`. The list `ad` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, starting from `a[1] - a[0]` up to `a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]`.
