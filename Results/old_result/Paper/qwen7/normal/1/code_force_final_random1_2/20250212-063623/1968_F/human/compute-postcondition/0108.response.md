Output State: **`a[i]' is now the value of `int(data[idx])', `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[i]' is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]' and `pf[i]` is added to `mp` with an empty list as its value, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current index `i` to the list associated with `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Given the initial conditions, `a[i]` is set to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `pf[i]` is added to `mp` with an empty list as its value. After executing the line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)`, the list for `pf[i]` in `mp` will contain the single element `i`.
