Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, meaning `idx` is set to twice the value of `n` plus one.
- `t` is decremented by 3 after the loop completes, indicating that the loop ran for `t` iterations, and in this case, `t` has completed 3 full iterations.
- `results` is a list of length `q * 3` containing the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') of the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, with an additional empty string appended to it.

After the loop, the `results` list will have the following structure:
- It contains the outcomes of the conditions checked in each of the three iterations.
- It ends with an additional empty string.

When the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement is executed, it will join all elements of the `results` list into a single string, separated by newlines (`\n`), and then print this string.

Given that the exact values of `n` and `q` are not provided, we can only describe the structure of the `results` list. Therefore, the printed output will be a series of strings ('YES' or 'NO') followed by an empty string, each separated by a newline.

Output: **YES\nNO\nYES\n\n** (assuming the results of the three iterations are 'YES', 'NO', 'YES' respectively)
