Output State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2, `not_c` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `A` is initially set to `True`. The line `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to `False` because the `not` operator negates the current value of `A`. The other variables (`arr[0]`, `set_`, and `not_c`) remain unchanged.
