Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input for each row of the grid, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a `line` read from standard input, `elements` maps each player and goal entity to their respective positions on the grid, `allPlayers` marks all players as `False`, and `goal` contains the coordinates of the blue ('B') and green ('G') goals based on the entities found in the grid.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 0, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, and either `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True` and `el` is equal to '.Q', or `el` is the third element of the `command` list which is '.', `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is 10, or `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index specified by `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element, if `obj` is a black piece ('.B'), `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `player` is set to the piece at `nxt` if `nxt` is occupied by another player's piece, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False` if `com` is 'T', `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if the current position (`pos`) is in a goal area, otherwise the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 1 or 2, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input. If `len(comand) == 3`, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True` if `el` is '.Q', otherwise `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0, and `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value. If `len(comand) != 3`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple equal to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is either `'.B'` and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True, or `isPlayer(obj)` is True and `elements['.B'] == nxt`. If `obj` does not meet the above conditions, `player` remains unchanged. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to False and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if the position `pos` is a goal position, where `team` is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)`. Otherwise, if the player at index `obj` exists, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `comand` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the second line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. If `el` is '.', and `obj` is an element of the `comand` list, then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. Otherwise, `obj` is the first element of the `comand` list, `com` is the second element of the `comand` list, `el` is the third element of the `comand` list, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value. If `el` is not '.', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` or `elements[nxt]` depending on the condition, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `com` is 'T' and a goal is scored. If `com` is not 'T', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` and `allPlayers[obj]` is set to False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
