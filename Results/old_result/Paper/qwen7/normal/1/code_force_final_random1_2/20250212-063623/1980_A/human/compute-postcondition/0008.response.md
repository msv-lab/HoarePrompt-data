Output State: **`freq[prob - 'A']` is incremented by 1, `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is also incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency count of the character `prob` in the list `freq`. Since `prob` is the next character in `a`, both `freq[prob - 'A']` and `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` are incremented by 1. These two expressions are equivalent because `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is the same as `prob - 'A'`. Therefore, the output state reflects that both these frequencies have been incremented.
