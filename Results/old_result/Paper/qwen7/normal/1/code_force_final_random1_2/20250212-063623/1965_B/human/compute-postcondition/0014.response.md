Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `l` must be greater than 3
   - `ans` is [4, 8]

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `i` should be incremented from 3 to 4.

5. **Determine the new condition for `l`**: For the loop to continue, `l` must still be greater than 4 (since `i` is now 4).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be 4.
   - `l` must still be greater than 4.
   - The state of `ans` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `l` must be greater than 4**
