Output State: **`na_frente` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `na_frente` ≤ 10^4, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs accumulated from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` lists, `v` is 0, `c` is `c` (one more than the previous value of `c`), `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `total`, `v`, `c`, and `pos_final`) remain unchanged.
