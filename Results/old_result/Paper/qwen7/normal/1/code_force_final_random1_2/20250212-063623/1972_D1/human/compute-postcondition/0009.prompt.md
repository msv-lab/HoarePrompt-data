You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `func_10()` times, which from the given information is known to be 3. Each iteration of the loop writes a positive integer to `sys.stdout`. The integers written follow a specific pattern: the first integer is greater than 1, the second is greater than 2, and the third is greater than 3. Since `func_10()` returns 3, the loop will write three lines to `sys.stdout`, with each line containing a positive integer greater than the previous one.
    #
    #To summarize, the output will consist of three lines, each containing a unique positive integer starting from at least 2 and increasing by at least 1 for each subsequent line. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all iterations will be:
    #
    #```
    #2
    #3
    #4
    #```
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6) are processed.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
