Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. Since no specific input value is provided, `res` is left as an input string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
