Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - The postcondition states that if the current value of `y` is greater than `x`, `y` remains unchanged. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `y` remains unchanged as well.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
   - The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop head only involves `j` and `m`, these are the only variables that can be adjusted.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is an input integer.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged.

4. **Post-Iteration States:**
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `m` remains the same (an input integer).
   - The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged according to the postcondition.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is an input integer**
