Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` must have at least 2 elements.
   - The difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is either 2 or even.
   - Depending on the difference, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` are updated accordingly.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - The list `a` does not change within the loop, so it still has at least 2 elements.
   - We need to check if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` meets the condition (either 2 or even).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - The postconditions for `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` depend on the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`, but since these values are not given, we assume they remain unchanged unless the new difference does not meet the condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is either 2 or even. If the difference is 2, `ans` remains 1. If the difference is even and `y` is greater than the difference divided by 2 minus 1, then `tmp` is a list containing the integer division of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` by 2, `ans` is incremented by the integer division of the difference by 2, and `y` is decreased by the integer division of the difference by 2 minus 1. Otherwise, `tmp`, `ans`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
