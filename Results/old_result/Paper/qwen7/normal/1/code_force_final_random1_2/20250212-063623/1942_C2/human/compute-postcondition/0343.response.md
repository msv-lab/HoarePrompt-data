Output State: **`even` is a non-empty iterable, `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decremented by `gap // 2`, which means `y` is reduced by half of `gap` (integer division). The values of `even` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
