Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `input_value`, which is the integer value obtained from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is equal to `len(a)`
   - `b` is a list of integers created from the input string
   - `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `max(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`
   - `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `min(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`
   - `new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if `input_value` (the integer obtained from `int(input())`) is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `input_value` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `input_value` must be greater than 0.

Since no other variables are directly affected by the loop head, the states of `i`, `b`, `new`, `new2`, and `new2[i]` remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `b` is a list of integers created from the input string, `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `max(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `min(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, and `input_value` must be greater than 0**.
