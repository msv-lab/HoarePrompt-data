Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program correctly reads the number of constraints (`n`) and processes each constraint.
3. The program maintains variables `start` and `end` to track the range of valid `k` values and a list `num` to store values excluded by the "not equal to" constraints.
4. The logic for updating `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint is correct:
   - For `t == 1`, `start` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `v`.
   - For `t == 2`, `end` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `v`.
   - For `t == 3`, the value `v` is added to the list `num`.
5. After processing all constraints, the program calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of excluded values (`count_num`) from the total range length (`end - start + 1`). This logic handles both cases where the range is valid and invalid.
6. The program correctly handles edge cases where `start > end` by returning 0.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
