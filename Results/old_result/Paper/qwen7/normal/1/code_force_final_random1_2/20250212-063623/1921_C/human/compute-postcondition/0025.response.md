Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `array2` contains the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` that are less than `b/a`, scaled by `a`.
- `n` is still greater than 1.
- The sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the other variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
