Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `k` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `res` is the last input string received during the loop execution, if `res` equals '<', `k` is set to `n-1`, and `best` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        best = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is an input string, and if the current value of `res` is equal to '<', then `best` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `res` is an input string. If `res` equals '<', the postcondition remains as `best` being 2, `i` being 2, `n` being greater than 1, and `res` being an input string. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and if `res` equals '<', then `best` is also 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
