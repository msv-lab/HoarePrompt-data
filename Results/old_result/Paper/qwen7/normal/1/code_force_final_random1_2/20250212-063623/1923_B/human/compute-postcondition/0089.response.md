Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`**

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Given that `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, the new value of `rest` becomes `rest - delta`, which simplifies to `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. The values of `delta` and `pos` remain unchanged, and the condition that `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)` also remains valid.
