Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), `m` is \(15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4\). If `m < a`, then `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\). Since there is no else part, the value of `z` remains unchanged if `m` is not less than `a`.
