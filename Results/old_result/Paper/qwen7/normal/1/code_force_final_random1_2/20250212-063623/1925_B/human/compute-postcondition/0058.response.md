Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true. `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is true, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `t`, `q`, `x`, `n`, `i`, and the condition involving `sqrt(x)` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` are met, otherwise `ans` remains as it was.
