Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is updated to an integer from the input, `b` is updated to an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. It does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, or `s`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged, while `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided as input.
