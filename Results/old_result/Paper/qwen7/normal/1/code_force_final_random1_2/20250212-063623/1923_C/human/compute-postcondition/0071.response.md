Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is increased by `x`, and if the value of `x` is 1, then the variable `j` is increased by 1; `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. Since `j` is increased by 1 only when `x` is 1, and `i` is increased by `x`, the updated states of the variables are as described above.
