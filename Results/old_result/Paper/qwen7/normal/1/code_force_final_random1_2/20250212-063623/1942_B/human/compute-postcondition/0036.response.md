Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Given that `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `res[i]` is now specifically `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
