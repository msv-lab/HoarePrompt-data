Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `tc`, `arr`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The updated value of `n` is now the integer input provided by the user.
