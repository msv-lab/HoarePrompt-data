Output State: **`rest` is reduced to `k`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`, all elements in the `a` array that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0, and `distance` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rest = k` simply assigns the value of `k` to the variable `rest`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged. Therefore, `rest` is now `k`, while `pos` is still less than `len(sorted_indices)`, all elements in the `a` array corresponding to indices in `sorted_indices` are still set to 0, and `distance` is still increased by 1.
