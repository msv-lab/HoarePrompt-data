You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, adjusting `k` based on the difference between each element and `m`. If `k` is non-negative after the iteration, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.

    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 5, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 4 because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration. The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 3, so for the loop to continue, we need `(3 + 1) * (3 + 1) <= n + (3 + 1)`, which simplifies to `16 <= n + 4` or `n >= 12`. 
    #
    #For the fourth iteration, the condition becomes `4 * 4 <= n + 4`, which simplifies to `16 <= n + 4` or again `n >= 12`. If `n` meets this condition, `ans` will be incremented by `(n + 4) // (4 * 4)`. Assuming `n` is at least 12, `(n + 4) // 16` will be 1 (since `n + 4` is at least 16), thus `ans` increases by 1. Therefore, `ans` will be 1 (from the first iteration) + 1 (from the second iteration) + 1 (from the third iteration) + 1 (from the fourth iteration) = 5. The value of `i` will be 4 after the loop completes.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns 4
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns the integer 4. It calculates a value for `ans` based on the initial values of `n` and `m` obtained from another function `func_7()`, and then returns `ans - 1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the integer 4.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `func_10()` times, which from the given information is known to be 3. Each iteration of the loop writes a positive integer to `sys.stdout`. The integers written follow a specific pattern: the first integer is greater than 1, the second is greater than 2, and the third is greater than 3. Since `func_10()` returns 3, the loop will write three lines to `sys.stdout`, with each line containing a positive integer greater than the previous one.
    #
    #To summarize, the output will consist of three lines, each containing a unique positive integer starting from at least 2 and increasing by at least 1 for each subsequent line. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all iterations will be:
    #
    #```
    #2
    #3
    #4
    #```
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each involving an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each t, it writes three unique positive integers to `sys.stdout` in ascending order, starting from at least 2. The integers written are determined by the `func_15()` function and `func_10()` function, respectively. After completing the loop, the function leaves `sys.stdout` with three lines of output, each containing a distinct positive integer in increasing order.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Code Analysis
The code provided contains many functions, but most of them are not used in solving the problem. We need to focus on the functions that are relevant to solving the problem.

#### Relevant Functions
1. **`func_10()`**: Reads an integer from stdin.
2. **`func_15()`**: This function seems to be the main logic for calculating the number of valid pairs.
3. **`func_16()`**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

### Function `func_15()`
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Explanation
- It reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
- It initializes `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
- For each `i`, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

### Correctness Check
To check the correctness of `func_15()`, let's compare its logic with the problem statement.

#### Problem Requirements
- We need to count pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Implementation Analysis
- The current implementation does not seem to directly address the problem requirements.
- The logic in `func_15()` does not involve checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Instead, it seems to be counting something related to divisors or multiples, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
