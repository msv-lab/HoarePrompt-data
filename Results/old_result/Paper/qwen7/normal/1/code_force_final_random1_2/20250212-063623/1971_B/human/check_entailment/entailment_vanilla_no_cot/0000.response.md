Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The solution fails to handle single character strings correctly. For a single character string, no rearrangement other than itself is possible, so the output should always be "NO".

2. **Handling Strings with Length 2 and Unique Characters**: If the string has exactly two unique characters, the solution incorrectly prints "NO". However, for such strings, we can rearrange the characters to form a different string. For example, for the string "aa", a valid rearrangement could be "aa" itself, but since the problem states that the new string `r` should not be equal to `s`, this specific check needs to be handled differently.

3. **General Case Handling**: The logic for generating `b` (sorted string) and `c` (reverse sorted string) is unnecessary and complicates the solution. We need to simply check if the original string `s` is already sorted or reverse sorted, and if so, generate a different rearrangement.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print("NO")
        elif len(set(s)) == 1:
            print("NO")
        elif s == ''.join(sorted(s)) or s == ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True)):
            # Generate a different rearrangement
            if len(s) % 2 == 0:
                mid = len(s) // 2
                s1 = s[:mid]
                s2 = s[mid:]
                print("YES")
                print(s2 + s1)
            else:
                mid = len(s) // 2
                s1 = s[:mid]
                s2 = s[mid+1:]
                print("YES")
                print(s2 + s[mid] + s1)
        else:
            print("YES")
            print(''.join(sorted(s)))
```

This corrected version handles all edge cases and ensures that the output is correct according to the problem statement.
