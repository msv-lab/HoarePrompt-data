Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop condition is `range(1, n - 1)`. This means `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n-2`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be 1 (the first value in the range), and `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n-1` should be at least 1).

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 10000.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` must be 1 to start the loop, we need to adjust `i` to 1.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `n` is at least 2.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`**.
