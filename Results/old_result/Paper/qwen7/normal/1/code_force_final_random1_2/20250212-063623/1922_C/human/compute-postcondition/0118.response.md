Given the initial state:
- `m` is an input integer.
- `j` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer, and the current value of `y` is greater than `x`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` and `y` are input integers with `y > x`.

However, the dictionary `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since no specific values or formulas for `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`.

Therefore, the output will be a difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`, where `y` is an integer greater than `x`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
