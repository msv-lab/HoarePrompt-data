Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, both are equal to the value of `next_year` before the assignment.**

Explanation: The code `current_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. Since the initial condition was that `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, and now they are both assigned the same value, the output state is that both `current_year` and `next_year` are equal to the value they had before the assignment.
