Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `(p1, p2, p3)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` from `cas_de_test`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the state includes:
     - `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`
     - `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`
     - `egalites` is either `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` with `resultats` containing `-1`, or `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` with `resultats` being a list containing `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2` and `egalites` being greater than or equal to 0.
   - For the next iteration, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will change to the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over different tuples `(p1, p2, p3)` from `cas_de_test`, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will change accordingly.
   - The values of `total_matchs` and `total_points` will be recalculated based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - The value of `egalites` and `resultats` will also change based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new state should reflect the updated values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.
   - The values of `total_matchs` and `total_points` will be recalculated using the new `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - The value of `egalites` and `resultats` will be recalculated based on the new `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `new_p1 + new_p2 + new_p3`, `egalites` is either `total_points - 2 * (new_p3 - new_p2) - 2 * (new_p3 - new_p1)` with `resultats` containing `-1`, or `egalites` is `3 * (new_p1 + new_p2 - new_p3)` with `resultats` being a list containing `3 * (new_p1 + new_p2 - new_p3) // 2` and `egalites` being greater than or equal to 0.**

Where `new_p1`, `new_p2`, and `new_p3` are the values from the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.
