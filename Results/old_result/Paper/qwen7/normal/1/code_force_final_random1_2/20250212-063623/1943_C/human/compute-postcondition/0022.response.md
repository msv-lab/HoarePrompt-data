Output State: **`d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes as specified by the input during each iteration of the loop; `a` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with `d` as its argument, and the return value of this function call has been assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `d` and `u2vs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
