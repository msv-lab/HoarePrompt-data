Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions.
Code of the loop:
for test in test_cases:
    n, a = test
    current_year = 0
    for ai in a:
        if current_year % ai == 0:
            next_year = current_year + ai
        else:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
        current_year = next_year
    results.append(current_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `current_year` is the final value based on the last element of the original `a`; `a` is an empty list; `ai` holds the last element of the original `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a` according to the given logic; `next_year` is equal to `current_year`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ai` is the last element of `a`, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one, `a` remains the same, `n` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
