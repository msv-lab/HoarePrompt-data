Postcondition: **`k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the new input string `b` plus the count of '1's in the original list, `i` is 2, `b` is the new input string, and `num_iterations` must be greater than 0. If '1' is found in `b`, the count of '1's is incremented by the count of '1's in `b`; otherwise, the count remains unchanged.**
