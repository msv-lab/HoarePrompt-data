The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) from user input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and the square root of \( n \) does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^3 \). It then iterates over possible pairs of integers \( (x, y) \) such that \( x \geq 1 \) and \( y \geq 1 \), updating a counter \( cnt \) based on certain conditions. Specifically, if the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1, and both \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \) hold, it adds the minimum of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \) to \( cnt \). Finally, it prints the value of \( cnt \).
