Output State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk` and is sorted, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`lst`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
