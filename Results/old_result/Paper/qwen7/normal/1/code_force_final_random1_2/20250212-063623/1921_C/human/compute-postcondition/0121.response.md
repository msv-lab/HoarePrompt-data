Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list with one additional element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` includes the calculated element. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.
