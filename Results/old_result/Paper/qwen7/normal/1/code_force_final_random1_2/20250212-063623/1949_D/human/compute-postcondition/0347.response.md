Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The key variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` will be equal to `n` after all iterations.
   - `nx` is a string constructed based on conditions inside the loop.
   - `n` will be greater than 0.

4. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - Since `j` will be equal to `n` after all iterations, it implies that `i` reached `n` during the loop execution.
   - Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `n`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`.
   - However, since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will stop when `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `n` must remain the same (greater than 0) for the loop to stop.

6. **Construct the new state**:
   - `j` will still be equal to `n` because the loop has already completed all iterations.
   - `nx` remains unchanged as it is constructed based on the loop body.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have completed its iterations.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the end of the current iteration and the start of the final iteration where the loop stops) should be:

**State: `j` is equal to `n`, `nx` is a string constructed based on the conditions inside the loop, `n` must be greater than 0**
