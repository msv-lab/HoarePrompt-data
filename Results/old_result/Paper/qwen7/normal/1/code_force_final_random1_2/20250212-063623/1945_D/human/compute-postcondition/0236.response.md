Output State: **`custo' is increased by `b_values[y] + a_values[0]'.**

Explanation: The initial state is that `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`. The code then adds `a_values[0]` to `custo`. Therefore, `custo` is now increased by the sum of `b_values[y]` and `a_values[0]`. The value of `b_values[y]` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `a_values[0]` is added to it.
