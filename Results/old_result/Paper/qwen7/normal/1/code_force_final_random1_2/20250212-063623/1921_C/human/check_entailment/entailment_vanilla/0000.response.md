Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the necessary parameters and the list of message sending times.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program extracts `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` from the first line of each test case.
   - It then extracts the list of message sending times into `arr`.

3. **Calculating Energy Consumption:**
   - The program calculates the energy required to send each message without turning off the phone.
   - Specifically, it checks if the time between consecutive messages (`arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`) is less than the energy cost of turning off and on the phone (`b / a`).
   - If the time between two messages is less than `b / a`, it adds the energy cost of sending the message without turning off the phone (`(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`) to `array2`.

4. **Determining Feasibility:**
   - The program sums up the energy costs calculated in the previous step and adds the energy cost of turning off and on the phone for the remaining messages.
   - It compares this total with the initial charge `f`.
   - If the total energy cost is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues Identified

1. **Logic Error:**
   - The logic for determining whether to turn off and on the phone is flawed. The program should consider the optimal strategy for minimizing energy usage.
   - The current logic only considers the direct energy cost of sending messages without turning off the phone, but it doesn't account for the strategic use of turning off and on the phone to minimize overall energy consumption.

2. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly sums the energy costs. It should calculate the minimum energy required by considering the optimal sequence of turning off and on the phone.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- Calculate the total time required to send all messages.
- Determine the optimal points to turn off and on the phone to minimize energy consumption.
- Ensure the phone's charge never falls below zero during the process.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
