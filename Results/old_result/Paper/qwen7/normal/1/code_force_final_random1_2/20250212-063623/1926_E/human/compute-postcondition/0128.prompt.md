You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is 2, `L` is [], `pow` is 16, `tot` is 12.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `L` becomes empty as the loop continues to process until `n` reaches 0. The variable `a` takes on the value of the last element added to `L`, which is 2. The variable `pow` is doubled in each iteration of the loop, starting from 8 after 3 iterations, and doubles again for each additional iteration until the loop completes. Since the loop processes until `L` is empty and `n` is 0, `pow` doubles for each of the 3 elements in `L`, resulting in `pow` being 16 (2^4). The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, which is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and it continues to be incremented by `a` (which is 2) for each full iteration of `L` being processed, resulting in `tot` being 12 (6 + 6).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case contains integers t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and given integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function processes these values but does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
