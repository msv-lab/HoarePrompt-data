Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that Alice always picks an element from `arr` and appends it to `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `arr`.

The program instead attempts to find the smallest missing number in the counter of the array elements, which does not align with the game rules. For instance, consider the following input:

```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

According to the problem description, an optimal game would proceed as follows:

1. Alice picks `0`, `a` becomes `[0, 1]`, `c` becomes `[0]`.
2. Bob picks `0`, `a` becomes `[1]`, `c` remains `[0]`.
3. Alice picks `1`, `a` becomes `[]`, `c` becomes `[0, 1]`.

The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `2` for this input, as it does not simulate the turns correctly.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always appends to `c` and Bob only removes from `a`. The current implementation does not achieve this.
