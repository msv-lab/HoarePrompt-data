Output State: **`zero` is 1 or 0, `zero_perc` is 0, `i` is 3, `one_perc` is -100, `one` is 1, and `lst` contains the element 2.**

The code `one += 1` increments the value of `one` by 1. Given that `one` was initially unspecified in the initial state but implied to start from 0 (since it's not explicitly given as anything else), after the increment, `one` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
