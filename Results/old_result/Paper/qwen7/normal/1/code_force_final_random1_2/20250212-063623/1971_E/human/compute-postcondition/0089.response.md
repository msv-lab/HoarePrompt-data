Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`.
   - The variable `i` is being initialized in the loop itself, not before it.
   - The variable `b` is used in the range function, but its state (length) is what determines the loop's execution.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is set inside the loop as `range(1, len(b))`, meaning `i` will start from 1 and go up to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Adjust the State Based on the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `len(b)` must be at least 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b) - 1`.
   - Since `i` is being set within the loop, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value before the loop starts.

4. **Consider the Given States:**
   - `i` is `len(a)`: This is not relevant to the loop condition since `i` is being redefined inside the loop.
   - `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`: This is not directly related to the loop condition either.

5. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(b)`, which must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`len(b)` must be at least 1**
