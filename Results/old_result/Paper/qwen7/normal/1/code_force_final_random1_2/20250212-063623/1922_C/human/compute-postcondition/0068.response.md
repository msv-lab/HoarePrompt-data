Output State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the line into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `l`. The initial values of `j`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
