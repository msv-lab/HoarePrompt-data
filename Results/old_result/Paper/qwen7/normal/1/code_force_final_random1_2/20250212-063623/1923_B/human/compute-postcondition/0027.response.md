Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices)`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `rest` is equal to `k - 0`.
   - `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1.
   - `delta` is equal to `0`.
   - `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.

3. **Analyze Each Variable in the Loop Head**:
   - **`rest`**: For the loop to continue, `rest` must be non-zero (`rest != 0`).
   - **`pos`**: For the loop to continue, `pos` must not be equal to the length of `sorted_indices` (`pos != len(sorted_indices)`).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `delta` is `0`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not affected by `delta` in this context.
   - `rest` must remain non-zero for the loop to continue. Therefore, `rest` should not be set to `0`.
   - `pos` must not be equal to `len(sorted_indices)` for the loop to continue.

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are `rest` and `pos`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`rest` is not equal to 0, `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, and `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`**.
