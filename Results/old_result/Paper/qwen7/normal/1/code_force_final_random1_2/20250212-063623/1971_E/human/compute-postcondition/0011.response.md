Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `1` and goes up to but does not include `len(a)`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**: Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Thus, `i` will be 3.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. We don't know the exact value of `len(a)`, but we know that `i` needs to be less than `len(a)` for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`. The list `ad` is not directly affected by the loop head and its contents remain the same unless modified inside the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`**
