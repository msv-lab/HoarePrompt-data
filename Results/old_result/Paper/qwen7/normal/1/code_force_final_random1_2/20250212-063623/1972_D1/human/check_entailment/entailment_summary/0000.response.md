Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that all functions work together to solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the requirements and the provided functions:

1. **Input Reading**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( m \). The functions `func_10` and `func_8` are designed to read integers and lists of integers, respectively. However, the correct function to use here should be `func_8` since it reads multiple test cases.

2. **Problem Solving**: The core logic of the problem involves calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function `func_15` seems to be intended to solve this part but is incorrectly implemented and does not actually solve the problem.

3. **Output Writing**: The function `func_16` writes the results to `sys.stdout`. However, it uses `func_15` which is not correctly solving the problem.

Given the execution summaries, the function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs, but it is incorrectly implemented. The function `func_15` returns a constant value of 4, which is clearly wrong for the given problem. Therefore, the overall program cannot be considered correct because it fails to solve the problem as required.

Correctness: **False**
