Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters (which depend on `n`).

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` will start with `i = 0` and increment by 2 until `i < 2 * n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `2 * n` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `score` is not used in the loop and its initial value (0) does not affect the loop's execution.
   - The variable `t` is not used in the loop and its initial value (unchanged) does not affect the loop's execution.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0, as specified by the range function.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` will start at 0.

**State: **`score` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
