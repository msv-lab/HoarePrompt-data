The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters, `l` and `r`, which define a sublist of a given list `a`. It aims to maximize the sum of the elements in this sublist by either setting all elements to the maximum value in the sublist or recursively processing the left and right parts of the sublist based on certain conditions. The function does not return a value but modifies the original list `a` and appends operations to the `ops` list. After the function concludes, the sublist defined by `l` and `r` will have either all elements set to the maximum value in the sublist or the sum of the sublist will be maximized according to the given conditions.
