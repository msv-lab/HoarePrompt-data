Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1`.
2. The function `func_1` processes the commands in the string `s` and updates the list `b` accordingly.
3. After constructing the list `b`, the function calculates the product of its elements modulo `m` and appends the result to the list `ans` in reverse order.
4. The overall logic matches the problem description and the provided example.

Given the description and the annotated program, the function appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
