Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 11`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' as its last element, `n` must be at least 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is now assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in `v1`.**

Explanation: The code uses `bisect.bisect_left` to find the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`. This operation does not change the values of any existing variables but introduces a new variable `it1` which holds the result of this operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
