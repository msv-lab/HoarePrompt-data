Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is decremented by 1 at the index equal to `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value at the index `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given that `i` is 0, it means the index being accessed in the list `a` is `a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
