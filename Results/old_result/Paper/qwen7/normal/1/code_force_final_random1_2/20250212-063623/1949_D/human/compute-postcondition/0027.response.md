Output State: **`x` is the input string or integer entered by the user, `j` is 4 if `x[2]` is 'S', otherwise `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `a[i]` is increased by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `a` or `i`, so we only know that `a[i]` has been incremented. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
