Output State: **`total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `v` is decreased by 1, `na_frente` remains the same, `best` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or remains the same as the original `best`, `custo_pra_passar_b` remains the same.**

This means that the value of `total` has been updated to its previous value plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The variable `v` has been decreased by 1. The values of `na_frente`, `best`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged from their previous states.
