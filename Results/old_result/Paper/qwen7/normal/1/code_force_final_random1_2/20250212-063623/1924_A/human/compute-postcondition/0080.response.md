Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` equals \(1 << (ord(s[0]) - ord('a')) + 1\), `cnt` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, so `cnt` becomes 1. The value of `cur` is calculated as `1 << (ord(s[0]) - ord('a')) + 1`, where `s[0]` is the first character of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
