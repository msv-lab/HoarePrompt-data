Output State: **`gr` is a grid, `impossible` remains `False`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is 'NO'**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value `'NO'`. The other variables (`gr`, `impossible`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states since the code snippet only assigns a value to `ans` and does not modify the other variables.
