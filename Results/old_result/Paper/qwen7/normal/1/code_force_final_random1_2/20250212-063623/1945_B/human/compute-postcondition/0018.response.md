Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from input, `b` is the second integer from input, `m` is the third integer from input, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, `a` is updated to the first integer from input, `b` is updated to the second integer from input, `m` is updated to the third integer from input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers read from the input. The expression for `mn` is also updated based on the new values of `a` and `b`.
