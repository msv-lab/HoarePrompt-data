Output State: **`da` remains the same, `di` is `di + 1`, `processing[di - 2]` is 1, `processing[di - 1]` is 1, `tmp` is the minimum value between `tmp` and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`**.

This means that the value of `di` has been incremented by 1, `processing[di - 2]` and `processing[di - 1]` remain as 1, and `tmp` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. The other variables retain their initial states.
