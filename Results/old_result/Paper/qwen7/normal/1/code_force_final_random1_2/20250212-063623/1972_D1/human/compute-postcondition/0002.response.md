Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `range(func_10())`. This means the loop will run for a number of iterations equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. The loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the loop variable isn't needed) and the function call `func_10()` are the relevant objects.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `func_15()` returns a positive integer and is printed. This information doesn't directly affect the loop's continuation but provides context about the state before the loop started.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than the number of iterations already completed. Since the loop has already run for one iteration, `func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than 1.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the result of `func_10()`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 1**
