Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the program matches the problem statement and the examples provided. Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program initializes a list `facts` which stores factorials up to 200001, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is used for calculating combinations later.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It also reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the suffix maximums `s`.

2. **Validation of Indices**:
   - The program checks if the last index of `p` equals the first index of `s`, and if the first index of `p` is 1 and the last index of `s` is `n`. If these conditions are not met, it prints 0 because no permutation can satisfy these constraints.

3. **Combination Calculations**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations and the factorial values stored in `facts`.
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums and uses the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to place elements between the suffix maximums.
   - Similarly, it iterates over the prefix maximums in reverse order and calculates the number of ways to place elements between the prefix maximums.
   - Finally, it multiplies the results of these calculations and takes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to get the final answer.

4. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1` is a helper function for extended Euclidean algorithm, which is not directly used in the main logic but might be used elsewhere in the codebase.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute modular multiplicative inverses and then performs the combination calculation.

Given the detailed breakdown and the example provided, the logic implemented in the program seems to correctly follow the problem statement and the examples. The program correctly handles the constraints and computes the number of valid permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Correctness: **True**
