### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not cover all necessary conditions for determining if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to confirm this conclusion.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to check specific conditions for pairs of columns and the last column.
   - It checks if the arrow in the first row at column `2*i + 1` is `<`, and ensures that either the arrow in the second row at `2*i` or `2*i + 2` is also `<`.
   - It also checks if the arrow in the first row at the last column `n - 1` is `<`, and ensures that the arrow in the second row at `n - 2` is also `<`.

2. **Flaws in Logic**:
   - The function only checks a subset of the grid and does not cover all necessary conditions. The robot's movement depends on the entire grid configuration, not just these specific pairs.
   - For example, if there is a sequence of arrows that forces the robot into a loop or a dead-end, `func_1` might incorrectly return `Yes` or `No`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - However, since `func_1` has flaws, the overall program will produce incorrect results.

#### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach `(2, n)`. Here is a revised approach:

1. **Simulate Robot Movement**:
   - Start at `(1, 1)`.
   - For each second, move according to the arrow in the current cell.
   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid infinite loops.

2. **Check Reachability**:
   - If the robot reaches `(2, n)`, return `Yes`.
   - If the robot gets stuck in a loop or reaches a dead-end, return `No`.

Here is a revised implementation:

```python
def can_reach_end(n, row1, row2):
    visited = set()
    x, y = 1, 1  # Starting position
    
    while True:
        if (x, y) in visited:
            return 'No'
        visited.add((x, y))
        
        if x == 2 and y == n:
            return 'Yes'
        
        if row1[y-1] == '<':
            x, y = x, y - 1
        elif row1[y-1] == '>':
            x, y = x, y + 1
        elif row2[y-1] == '<':
            x, y = x + 1, y - 1
        elif row2[y-1] == '>':
            x, y = x + 1, y + 1
        
        if x < 1 or x > 2 or y < 1 or y > n:
            return 'No'

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(can_reach_end(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_2()
```

This solution simulates the robot's movement through the grid and checks if it can reach `(2, n)`. It avoids the flaws present in the original `func_1` and correctly handles all test cases.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: False**

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`. The revised solution provides a correct approach to solving the problem.
