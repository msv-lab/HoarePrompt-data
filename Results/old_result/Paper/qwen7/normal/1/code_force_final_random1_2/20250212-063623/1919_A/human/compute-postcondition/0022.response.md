Output State: **`t` is 0, `results` is a list containing tuples for each iteration where each tuple includes the `winner`, the original values of `a` and `b`, and possibly other information.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` has reached 0, indicating that all input pairs of integers `(a, b)` have been processed. The `results` list contains the outcome of `func_1(a, b)` for each pair, along with the original values of `a` and `b` for each iteration. This list captures the complete history of the function evaluations and the corresponding inputs, reflecting the processing of all input pairs through the loop.
