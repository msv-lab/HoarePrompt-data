Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, and the current value of `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 1)` equals 0; `tmp` is 'b'**.

Explanation: The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of the character that corresponds to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the current value of `i`. Since `i` was initially 0, after executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 1. The value of `tmp` is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + 1)`, which results in 'b'. The conditions involving `k` and `cur` remain unchanged.
