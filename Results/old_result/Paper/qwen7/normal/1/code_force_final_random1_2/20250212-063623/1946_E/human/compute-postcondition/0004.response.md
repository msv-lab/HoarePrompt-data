Output State: **a is a positive integer less than b, b is a positive integer, c is the result of func_1(b, a) with a as the second argument, d is the result of func_1(b, a) with b as the first argument.**

Explanation: The code `c, d = func_1(b, a)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a`. The function returns two values which are assigned to `c` and `d` respectively. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `a` remains a positive integer less than `b`, and `b` remains a positive integer. The values of `c` and `d` are determined by the function `func_1` with `b` and `a` as its parameters.
