Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which processes each test case to calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed.
2. For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string `a`.
3. It then calculates how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds by using the formula `max(0, m - f)` where `f` is the frequency of each difficulty level.
4. The sum of these values gives the total number of additional problems needed.
5. The program iterates over all test cases, performing the above steps for each one and appending the result to the `results` list.
6. Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the required number of additional problems for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
