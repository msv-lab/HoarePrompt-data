Postcondition: **All characters of the string `s` are processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, and `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
