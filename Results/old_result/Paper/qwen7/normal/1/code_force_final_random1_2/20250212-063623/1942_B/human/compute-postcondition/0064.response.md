Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`
- `ar` is a list of integers
- `n` is an input integer
- `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i]`
- `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts from `len(ar) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.
2. **List `ar`**: The list `ar` remains unchanged within the loop.
3. **Integer `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop.
4. **Variable `mex`**: The value of `mex` is determined based on the current value of `i` and the list `ar`. Since `i` changes, `mex` will change accordingly.
5. **List `res`**: The list `res` is updated based on the current values of `i`, `mex`, and `ar`. Since `i` changes, the elements of `res` will be updated accordingly.

### Adjusting the States
- **Variable `i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its current value. So, `i` will be `len(ar) - 3`.
- **Variable `mex`**: The new value of `mex` will be calculated as `n - ar[i]` where `i` is now `len(ar) - 3`.
- **List `res`**: The elements of `res` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and `mex`.

### Final State
State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.**

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.**
