Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `j` will increment by 1.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **Variable `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2 if it was 1, otherwise 1. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. So, `j` will be 3.
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it directly. It is given that `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - The postconditions related to `xx`, `i`, `sb`, and `nx` are not directly affected by the loop itself but depend on the values of `i` and `j` within the loop. These conditions remain valid for the next iteration unless modified inside the loop body, which is not provided here.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`.
   - Since `j` will be incremented by 1, `j` will be 3.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0**
