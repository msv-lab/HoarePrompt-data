Output State: **`start` is 0; `vis` is a set containing 0; `nums[0]` is a non-zero value.**

The code `vis.add(start)` adds the value of `start` (which is 0) to the set `vis`. This changes the state of `vis` to a set containing the element 0. The values of `start` and `nums[0]` remain unchanged, with `start` still being 0 and `nums[0]` still being a non-zero value.
