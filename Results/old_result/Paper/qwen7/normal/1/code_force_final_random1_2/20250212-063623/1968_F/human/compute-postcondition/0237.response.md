The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, and the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is now 2 * n + 5, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1, `results` is `['YES', 'NO']`, `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**
