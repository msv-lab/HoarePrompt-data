Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(m)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be 0.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < m`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to continue.

Given the initial states:
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.
- `curr` retains its value.
- `ans` retains its value.

We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. The key variables here are `i` and `m`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be 0 (the initial value).
- `m` should be greater than 0 (so that the loop can execute).

The final state to be adjusted is:
**`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
