Output State: **`ans` has a new element appended which is the character from `alp` list at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the slice of `rev_array` starting from index `j` minus 1, `rev_array` remains unchanged.**

This means that the `ans` list now contains an additional element. This element is determined by finding how many times `rev_array[j]` appears in the sublist of `rev_array` starting from index `j` to the end, then using that count as an index in the `alp` list to get the corresponding character. The `rev_array` itself does not change.
