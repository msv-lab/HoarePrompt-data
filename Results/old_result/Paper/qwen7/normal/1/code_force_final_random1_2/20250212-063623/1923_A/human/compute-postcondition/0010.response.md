Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 999, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` (if `x` and `y` are valid indices)**.

Explanation: The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` takes an input string, removes all spaces from it, and assigns the result back to `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. The new value of `arr` is the original input string without any spaces.
