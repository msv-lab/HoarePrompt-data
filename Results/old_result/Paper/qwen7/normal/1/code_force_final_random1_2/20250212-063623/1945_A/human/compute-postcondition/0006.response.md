Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the first part to an integer, `c` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the last part to an integer, and `b` is updated to be the original value of `b` plus `c`.**

Explanation: The code `b += c` increments the value of `b` by `c`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `b` is now the original value of `b` plus `c`.
