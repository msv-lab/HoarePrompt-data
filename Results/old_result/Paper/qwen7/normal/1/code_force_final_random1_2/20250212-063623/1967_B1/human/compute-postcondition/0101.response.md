Output State: **`count` is 5, `countmins` is 4, `ans` is `n` + (int(`n` / 2) / 2) + 1 + int(`n` // 3 / 3) + 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `t + 1, `g` is now `n` // 3, `g` is updated to int(`n` / 5), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
