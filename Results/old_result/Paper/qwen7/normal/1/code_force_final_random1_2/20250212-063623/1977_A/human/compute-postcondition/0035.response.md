Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, and `n` is not equal to `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` remains greater than `n`. Otherwise, if `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` is set to `n - 1`. In all other cases, `m` and `n` remain equal, and at least one of them is even.
