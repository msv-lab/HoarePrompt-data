Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0, `dp` is set to True.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `dp`. No other changes are made to the initial state of the variables. Therefore, the conditions and values of `tc`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `dp` is now explicitly set to `True`.
