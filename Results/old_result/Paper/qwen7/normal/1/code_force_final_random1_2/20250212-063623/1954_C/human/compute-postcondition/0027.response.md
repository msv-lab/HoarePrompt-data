Output State: **`new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of `new2` and `new` arrays are updated based on the new index `i + 1`. The initial conditions for `new2` and `new` remain valid for the next index.
