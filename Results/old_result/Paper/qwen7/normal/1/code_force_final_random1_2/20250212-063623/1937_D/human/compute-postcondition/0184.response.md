Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l >= 0`. If `r - l < 0`, the postcondition remains as `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r]`.
