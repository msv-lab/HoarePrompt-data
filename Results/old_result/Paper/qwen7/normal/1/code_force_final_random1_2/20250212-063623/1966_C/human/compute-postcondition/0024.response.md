Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is at least 2, and `dp` is updated to `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`**.

This means that the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. All other variables remain in their initial or previously described states.
