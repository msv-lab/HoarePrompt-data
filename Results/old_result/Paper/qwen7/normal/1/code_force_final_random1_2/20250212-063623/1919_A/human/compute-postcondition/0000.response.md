Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the value of `t` remains within this range after executing the code. The other conditions and constraints for `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still valid, but since no code has been executed that affects them, they are not included in the updated state.
