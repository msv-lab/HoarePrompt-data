Output State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two elements which are the input from the user, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains one element which is the input from the user. After executing the code, `gr` now contains two elements: the original input and the new input from the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
