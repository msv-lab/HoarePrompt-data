Output State: **`k` is an empty list, `b` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `b = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. Since the initial state of `k` is an empty list and no changes were made to it, `k` remains an empty list. The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is treated as a string.
