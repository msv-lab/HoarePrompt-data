Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(func_10())`. The variables involved in the loop head are the result of `func_10()` and the underscore `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer. The loop will stop when `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative number.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `func_14()` returns an integer.
   - `n` retains its original value.
   - `k` retains its original value.
   - The stdout writes the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer. If `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative number, the loop will terminate.
   - Since the loop head involves `func_10()`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - The state of `func_14()`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged.
   - The state of `func_10()` needs to be adjusted to ensure it returns a positive integer for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`func_14()` returns an integer, n retains its original value, k retains its original value, and func_10() returns a positive integer**.
