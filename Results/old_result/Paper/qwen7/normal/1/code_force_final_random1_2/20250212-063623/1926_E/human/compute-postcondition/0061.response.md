Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for a in L:`. This means the variables involved are `a` and `L`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `L` is a list containing `[1, 1, 1]`.
   - `a` is the variable that will take on each element of `L` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `L` must contain at least one element. In this case, `L` contains three elements, so the loop will definitely execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `L` is a list with three elements, the loop will start with `a` being the first element of `L`, which is `1`.
   - Therefore, before the loop starts, `a` should be set to the first element of `L`.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` should be set to the first element of `L`, which is `1`.
- `L` remains as `[1, 1, 1]`.

So, the final state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1, 1]**
