Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `l` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` to the original value of `b[s - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
