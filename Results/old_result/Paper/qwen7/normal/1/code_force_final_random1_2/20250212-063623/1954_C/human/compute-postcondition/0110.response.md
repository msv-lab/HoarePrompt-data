The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially equal to `len(a)`, incrementing `i` by 1 means `i` is now `len(a) + 1`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is len(a) + 1, `new2` is a list of length len(a) where each element is min(a[j], b[j]) for the indices j where a[j] equals b[j], and None otherwise, and the last element is min(a[i-2], b[i-2]), and new2[i] is max(a[i], b[i]), and `new` is a list of length len(a) where each element is min(a[j], b[j]).**
