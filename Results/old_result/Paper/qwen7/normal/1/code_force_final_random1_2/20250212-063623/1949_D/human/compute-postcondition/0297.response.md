Output State: **`j` is 2 or 3, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is 'FF'**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. Given the initial conditions, if `xx[i][j-1]` was not '?', `nx` would already have the value of `xx[i][j-1]`, and then 'F' is appended to it. If `xx[i][j-1]` was '?', then `j` would be 3 and `nx` would be 'S' under certain conditions or 'F' otherwise, and then 'F' is appended to it. In both cases, 'F' is added to the current value of `nx`, resulting in `nx` being `'FF'`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
