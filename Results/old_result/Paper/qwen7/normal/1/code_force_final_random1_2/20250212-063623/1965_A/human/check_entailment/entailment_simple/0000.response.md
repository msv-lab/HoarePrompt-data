Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem describes a game where players take turns removing a fixed number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player unable to make a move losing. The key insight is that the game state can be reduced to the parity of the number of piles with a unique stone count.

2. **Analyze the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It calls a function `func_1` with the array of stones.
   - The function `func_1` checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, Alice wins immediately.
   - Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes.
   - It iterates through this list to check if there are any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive unique pile sizes. If such a gap exists, it sets `not_c` to False.
   - It toggles the boolean `A` based on the presence of a gap and the parity of the number of unique pile sizes.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise 'Bob'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the winning condition based on the game rules.
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases and the main logic is sound.
   - The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the game rules and the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
