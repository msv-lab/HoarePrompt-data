### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Summaries Analysis:**
   - **Function 16:** This function processes a series of test cases, each involving an integer \(t\) (1 ≤ \(t\) ≤ 10^4). It writes three unique positive integers to `sys.stdout` in ascending order, starting from at least 2. The integers are determined by `func_15()` and `func_10()`, respectively. After completing the loop, it leaves `sys.stdout` with three lines of output, each containing a distinct positive integer in increasing order.

3. **Function 15 Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\) using a specific formula. Let's analyze its implementation:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         (n, m) = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - This function seems to be attempting to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but the logic is incorrect. The formula used does not match the problem constraints.

4. **Function 10 Analysis:**
   - This function reads an integer from standard input.
     ```python
     def func_10():
         return int(input())
     ```

5. **Function 7 Analysis:**
   - This function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input.
     ```python
     def func_7():
         return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
     ```

6. **Function 16 Analysis:**
   - This function processes a series of test cases and prints the results as described.
     ```python
     def func_16():
         for _ in range(func_10()):
             sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
     ```

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_15` attempts to solve the problem but uses an incorrect approach. The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly implement the required logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
