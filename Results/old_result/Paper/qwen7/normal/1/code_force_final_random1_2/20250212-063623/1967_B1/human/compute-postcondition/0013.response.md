Output State: **`countmins` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by the value of `countmins`, which is 1. So, `g` becomes `int(n / 2) - 1`. The values of `count`, `ans`, and the condition `if g is less than countmins` remain unchanged.
