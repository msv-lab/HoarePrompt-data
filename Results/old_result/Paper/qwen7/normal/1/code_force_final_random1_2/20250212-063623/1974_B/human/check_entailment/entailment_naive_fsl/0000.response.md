Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to decode the string by replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique characters string. However, the implementation of this logic is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` tries to replace characters directly in the string `s` using `replace`, which is not suitable for this problem because it does not handle the symmetric replacement correctly. Instead, it should map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding symmetric character in the sorted unique characters string.

2. **Symmetric Mapping**: The function should create a mapping between each character in the unique characters string and its symmetric counterpart. This mapping should then be used to decode the encoded string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

In this corrected version:
- We create a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character to its symmetric counterpart.
- We then use this dictionary to decode the encoded string `s`.

This approach ensures that the decoding process is handled correctly according to the problem description.
