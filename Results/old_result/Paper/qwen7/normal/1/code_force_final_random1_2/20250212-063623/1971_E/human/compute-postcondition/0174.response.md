Output State: **`i` is 3; `v` contains a value equal to `ad[1] / bd[1]`, and `v` now has an additional element which is `ad[3] / bd[3]`.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3 and `v` contains a value equal to `ad[1] / bd[1]`. The code snippet `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Since `i` is 3, the new value appended to `v` is `ad[3] / bd[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
