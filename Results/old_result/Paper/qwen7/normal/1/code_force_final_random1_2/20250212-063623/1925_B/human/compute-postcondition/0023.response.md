Postcondition: `x` and `n` are integers, `i` is an integer, and `ans` is an integer. If the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is met, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i`. If the condition is not met, `ans` retains its original value and `i` retains its original value.
