Output State: **The program returns d and c, where d is the result of func_1(b, a) with b as the first argument, and c is the result of func_1(b, a) with a as the second argument.**

This means that the function `func_1` is called twice with the same arguments `(b, a)` but in different orders. The value of `d` is the result of `func_1(b, a)` when `b` is the first argument, and `a` is the second argument. Similarly, `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a)` when `a` is the second argument. Since the function call is the same in both cases but with the arguments swapped, `c` and `d` will be the same if `func_1` is commutative (i.e., `func_1(x, y) == func_1(y, x)`). However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can only state that both `d` and `c` are the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`.
