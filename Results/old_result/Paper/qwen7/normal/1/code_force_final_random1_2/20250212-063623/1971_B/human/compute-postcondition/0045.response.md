Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` followed by `t` strings `s`. For each string `s`, it checks if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then either the lexicographically smallest or the largest permutation of `s`, depending on which is equal to `s`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value but ensures that for each input string, the appropriate output is printed.**
