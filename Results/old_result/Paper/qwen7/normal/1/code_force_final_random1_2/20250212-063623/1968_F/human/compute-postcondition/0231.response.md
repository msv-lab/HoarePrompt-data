Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is simply `for _ in range(q)`. This means the loop depends on the variable `q`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `q` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `idx` is 2 * n + 3.
   - `data` is a list of values.
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `pf` is an empty list.
   - `mp` is an empty dictionary.
   - `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`.
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 2]`.
   - `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`.
   - `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.
   - `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`.
   - `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1.
   - `results` is either `['YES']` if the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` is true, or it is appended with 'NO' otherwise.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `q`, we need to decrement `q` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`i`, `idx`, `data`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `results`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx` is 2 * n + 3, `data` is a list of values, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 2]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1, `results` is either `['YES']` if the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` is true, or it is appended with 'NO'.**
