Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `lst[tmp] != []`. This means the loop will continue as long as the list `lst[tmp]` is not empty.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `z` is an input integer.
   - `tmp` is equal to `lst[z].pop().pop()`.
   - `one` is `True`.
   - `lst[tmp]` is not empty.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on the list `lst[tmp]`. For the loop to continue, `lst[tmp]` must remain non-empty.
   - Since `tmp` is derived from `lst[z].pop().pop()`, the value of `tmp` might change if the list `lst[z]` is modified.
   - However, the current state already tells us that `lst[tmp]` is not empty, so no adjustment is needed for `lst[tmp]` itself.
   - The only variable that could affect the loop condition is `tmp`, but since `tmp` is derived from `lst[z]`, and `lst[z]` is not directly modified within the loop (only accessed), no direct adjustment is needed for `tmp`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The only thing that needs to be ensured is that `lst[tmp]` remains non-empty for the next iteration. Since `lst[tmp]` is not empty now, no adjustment is needed for the loop condition.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `lst[z].pop().pop()`, `one` is `True`, and `lst[tmp]` is not empty**
