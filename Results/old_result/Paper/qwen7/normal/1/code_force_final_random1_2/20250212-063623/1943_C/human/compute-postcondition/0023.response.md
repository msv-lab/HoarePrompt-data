Output State: **`d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes as specified by the input during each iteration of the loop, `a` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `d, previous = bfs(a)` calls the `bfs` function with the argument `a`. The `bfs` function returns two values, which are assigned to `d` and `previous` respectively. The value of `a` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, and the list `u2vs` remains unchanged.
