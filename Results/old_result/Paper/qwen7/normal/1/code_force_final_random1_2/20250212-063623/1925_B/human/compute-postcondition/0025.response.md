Postcondition: `x`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` are integers. If the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is met, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its original value and `i` retains its original value.
