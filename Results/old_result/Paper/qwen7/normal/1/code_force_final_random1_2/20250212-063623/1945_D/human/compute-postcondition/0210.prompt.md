Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is 0, `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`, `num_fila` is an integer obtained from `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`
Code of the loop:
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
        custo += a_values[y]
    else:
        custo += b_values[y]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is initialized to a value such that `y >= max_p - 1`, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]`, `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`, and `num_fila` is an integer obtained from `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`. If `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`. `y` is the last element in the list `a` minus 1, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, and `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`. Here, `y` is the last element in the list `a` minus 2, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, and `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
