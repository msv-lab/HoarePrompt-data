The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and maps each string to an integer, storing the result in `l`. This means `l` will be a list of integers. The initial values of `sm`, `a`, `j`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is less than 0), or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is greater than or equal to 0); `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\); `j` is `t`; `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer; `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
