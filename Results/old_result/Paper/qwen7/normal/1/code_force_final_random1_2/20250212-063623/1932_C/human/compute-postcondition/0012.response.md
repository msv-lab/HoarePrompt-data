Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a list.

4. **Loop Body Logic**:
   - If the character at index `i` of `s` is 'L', then `b` contains one element which is `a[l]`, and `l` is increased by 1.
   - If the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains one additional element appended from `a[r]`, and `r` is decremented by 1.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will run again if `i < n` still holds true.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1).

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The state of `b`, `s`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged because the loop body logic does not affect these variables unless the condition inside the loop changes them.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**.
