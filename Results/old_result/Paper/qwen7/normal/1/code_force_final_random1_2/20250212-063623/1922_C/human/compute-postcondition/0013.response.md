Postcondition: **`i` is 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`. If `i` is 2 and `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2] = 2`. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**.
