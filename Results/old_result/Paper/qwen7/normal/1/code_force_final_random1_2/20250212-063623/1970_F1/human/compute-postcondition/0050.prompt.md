Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of standard input after stripping and splitting it, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`. If `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, then `elements[line[ind]]` is `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, otherwise `elements[line[ind]]` is `i`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, `i` remains 0. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is either 2 or remains 1. If `line[ind] != '..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. Otherwise, `ind` is 2, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `tmp` is 0 if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True` and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1 if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing one tuple `(0, 3)`. If `line[ind][1] != 'G'`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
