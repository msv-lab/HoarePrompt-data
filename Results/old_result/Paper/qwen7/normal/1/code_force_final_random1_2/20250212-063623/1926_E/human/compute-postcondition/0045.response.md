Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n`.
2. **Determine the current state of `n`**: According to the given state, `n` is an integer equal to the first input value.
3. **Understand the requirement for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `n` must be true (non-zero).

Given that `n` is an integer and it is equal to the first input value, the only way to ensure the loop executes the first time is to make sure `n` is non-zero. If `n` were zero, the loop would not execute at all.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be a non-zero integer, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is an empty list**
