You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 represents the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 1 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 1 and then decremented to 0, meaning the loop condition `t > 0` will no longer be true. Therefore, the loop will stop executing. At this point, `t` will be 0, which is still within the range of 1 to 1 (inclusive), `n` will be the last input integer received, and `nums` will be the list of integers from the last input string split and converted.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`.

2. **Dividing Books into Two Piles:**
   - The program does not explicitly divide the books into two piles.
   - Instead, it simply takes the maximum value from all but the last element of `nums` and adds it to the last element of `nums`.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The result is calculated as `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`.
   - This means the program considers the maximum of all elements except the last one, and adds it to the last element of the list.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    2
    1 1
    ```
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The program calculates `max([1]) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    2 3 3 1
    ```
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The program calculates `max([2, 3, 3]) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    5
    2 2 3 2 2
    ```
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The program calculates `max([2, 2, 3, 2]) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5`, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    2
    10 3
    ```
  - Expected Output: `13`
  - Explanation: The program calculates `max([10]) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13`, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    3
    1 2 3
    ```
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The program calculates `max([1, 2]) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that the books are divided into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the maximum books from each pile is maximized. Instead, it simply takes the maximum of all but the last element and adds it to the last element, which does not guarantee the optimal solution.
