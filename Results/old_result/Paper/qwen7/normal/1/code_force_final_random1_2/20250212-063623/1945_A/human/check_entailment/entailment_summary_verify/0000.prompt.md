You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it updates the count of extroverts by adding the count of universals and then calculates and prints a result based on the adjusted counts of introverts and extroverts. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the allocation of tents according to the given rules. Specifically, the program incorrectly combines the number of extroverts and universals before attempting to allocate tents. This approach fails to properly account for the specific needs of introverts and the constraints on the number of people per tent.

For example, consider the test case `1 2 3`:
- According to the problem description, we need 1 tent for the introvert.
- We also need 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
- The remaining 2 universals can share another tent.

However, the program attempts to combine the number of extroverts and universals into a single value (`b += c`) and then tries to allocate tents based on this combined value. This leads to incorrect results. For instance, in the test case `1 2 3`, the program outputs `3`, which is correct, but for the test case `1 4 1`, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect because it is possible to accommodate the participants as follows:
- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
- 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.

Thus, the minimum number of tents needed is 3, not -1. This indicates that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
