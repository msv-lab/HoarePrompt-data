Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`, `resultats` is `[-1]`**.

The code appends `-1` to the list `resultats`. Since `resultats` was initially empty, after appending `-1`, it becomes `[-1]`. The values of `total_matchs`, `total_points`, `egalites`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
