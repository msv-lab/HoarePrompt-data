Output State: **`score` is `l[0]`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 0, `score` is now `l[0]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged, with `i` being incremented to 1.
