Output State: **`score` is `l[3]`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value at index `i` in the list `l`. Given that `i` is 3, `score` is updated to `score + l[3]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
