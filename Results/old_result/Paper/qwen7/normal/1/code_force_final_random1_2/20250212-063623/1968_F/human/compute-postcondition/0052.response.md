Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is now either an empty list or a list containing 'YES', `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`**

Explanation: The code retrieves two values from the dictionary `mp` using keys `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. These values are stored in `v1` and `v2` respectively. No other changes are made to the variables, so their previous states remain unchanged.
