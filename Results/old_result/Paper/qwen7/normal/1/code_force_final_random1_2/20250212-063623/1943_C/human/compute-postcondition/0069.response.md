Output State: **`ops` is a list containing five tuples: (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), and (`c1`, `i`); `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged; `i` is `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple (`c1`, `i`) to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains four tuples: (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), and (`c2`, `i`). After appending the new tuple, `ops` now contains five tuples. The value of `i` remains `i + 2` as specified in the initial state. All other variables (`d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1`) remain unchanged.
