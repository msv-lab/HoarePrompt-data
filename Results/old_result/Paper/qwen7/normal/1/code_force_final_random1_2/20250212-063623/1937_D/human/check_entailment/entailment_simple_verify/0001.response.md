### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement is determined by the characters in the string `s`, where `<` means move left and `>` means move right. After each move, the direction at the current cell is reversed.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - The code uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results for the left and right traversals respectively.
   - The logic for computing the time involves iterating through the string `s` and using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time for each cell.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Left Traversal (`A` Array)**:
     - The code correctly initializes the `A` array to store the cumulative times for the left traversal.
     - For each index `i` where `s[i] == '>',` the code updates `A` by adding the distance from the last occurrence of `'>'` multiplied by the number of occurrences so far.
     - This ensures that `A[i]` correctly stores the time taken to reach the current cell from the start, considering the reversals.

   - **Right Traversal (`B` Array)**:
     - Similarly, the code correctly initializes the `B` array to store the cumulative times for the right traversal.
     - For each index `i` where `s[i] == '<',` the code updates `B` by adding the distance from the last occurrence of `'<'` multiplied by the number of occurrences so far.
     - This ensures that `B[i]` correctly stores the time taken to reach the current cell from the end, considering the reversals.

   - **Main Loop**:
     - The main loop in `func_1` correctly combines the left and right traversal times to compute the total time for each cell.
     - The logic handles various boundary conditions, such as when the pinball reaches the edge of the grid.
     - The code correctly handles the case where the pinball starts at the edge of the grid and the case where the pinball moves in a single direction without reversing.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the pinball starts at the edge of the grid.
   - The code handles the case where the pinball moves in a single direction without reversing.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the solution for the problem. The intermediate results stored in `A` and `B` are used to accurately compute the time for each cell.
   - The logic for combining the left and right traversal times is sound and correctly accounts for the reversals and boundary conditions.
