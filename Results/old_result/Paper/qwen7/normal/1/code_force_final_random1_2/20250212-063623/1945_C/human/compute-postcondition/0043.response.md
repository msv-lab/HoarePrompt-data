Output State: **`zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is 100 or 50, `i` is 4, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is -400, `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4, `n` must be greater than 4**.

Explanation: The variable `one` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 (implied initial value since it's not given explicitly) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
