### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \). If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **func_4()**: This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
     - If \( k \) is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
     - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \((n^2 - 1) / 2\).
     - If \( n \) is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(n^2 / 2\).
     - If \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - **func_1()**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
     - It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
     - It iteratively modifies the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
     - If `k` becomes zero, it returns the current permutation.
     - If `k` is less than the current index, it calls `func_2()` to swap elements.
     - Otherwise, it updates `k` and calls `func_3()` to swap elements.
   - **func_2()**: This function swaps two elements in the list.
   - **func_3()**: This function swaps two elements in the list.
   - **func_5()**: This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - **func_6()**: This function orchestrates the entire process by calling `func_4()`, `func_1()`, and `func_5()`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Edge Cases**: 
     - If \( k \) is odd, the function correctly returns "No" because the Manhattan value must be even.
     - If \( k \) is even and within the maximum possible range, the function constructs a valid permutation.
   - **Constructing Permutations**: 
     - The function uses a greedy approach to construct permutations by swapping elements to minimize the Manhattan value.
     - However, the implementation of `func_1()` has several issues:
       - The loop in `func_1()` iterates from `n` to `-1` with a step of `-2`, which means it only considers even indices. This is problematic because the Manhattan value depends on the absolute differences between the elements and their positions, and the loop should consider all indices.
       - The logic for updating `k` and swapping elements is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the condition `if k < i - 1:` is incorrect and may lead to incorrect permutations.
       - The function `func_3()` and `func_2()` are redundant and do not contribute to the correct construction of the permutation.

4. **Testing**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are tested and the outputs match the expected results, but this does not guarantee the correctness of the algorithm.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value. The issues in `func_1()` and the redundant functions `func_2()` and `func_3()` make the implementation incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
