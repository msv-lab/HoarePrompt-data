Output State: **Postcondition: `ind` is equal to the length of `line`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[-1][0]` equals 'B', 1 otherwise, and `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, ind)` for every index `ind` where `line[ind]` is not '..', `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` for each player found in `line`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ind` will be equal to the length of the `line` list, indicating that the loop has processed every element in `line`. The variable `tmp` will be 0 if the last non-`'..'` character in `line` starts with 'B', and 1 otherwise. Additionally, `goal[tmp]` will contain tuples `(i, ind)` for every index `ind` where `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`. For each player found in `line`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` will be set to `False`.
