Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `v` which ranges from `na_frente` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `v`**: The loop will start with `v` equal to `na_frente` and decrement until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Adjust the State of `na_frente`**: Since the loop starts with `v` set to `na_frente`, we need to ensure that `na_frente` is initialized correctly.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`c`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, `best`) are not directly involved in the loop initialization and can remain as they are unless there's additional context that suggests otherwise.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `na_frente`. 

**Final Answer**:
State: **`na_frente` must be initialized correctly (an integer within the range 1 ≤ na_frente ≤ 10^4)**.
