Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly handles the input for the number of constraints, either returning an integer input or 1 based on the boolean parameter `isOne`.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly parses the input for each test case, handling both space-separated and character-separated inputs appropriately.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function correctly concatenates the elements of a list into a single string, separated by a given symbol.
4. **Function `func_4`**: This function correctly finds all occurrences of a substring in a string and returns their starting indices.
5. **Function `func_5`**: This function correctly returns the indices of a given element in a list.
6. **Function `func_6`**: This function correctly filters sublists based on a specific index value.
7. **Function `func_7`**: This function correctly processes the constraints and the list of integers to find the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It identifies the minimum value (`start`) from constraints of type 1, the maximum value (`end`) from constraints of type 2, and counts the number of integers in the provided list (`num`) that fall within the range `[start, end]`. It handles the case where the range is invalid (i.e., `start > end`) by returning 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the difference between the range size (`end - start + 1`) and the count of integers within the range, ensuring the result is non-negative.

Given that all functions work as intended and collectively meet the requirements of the problem, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
