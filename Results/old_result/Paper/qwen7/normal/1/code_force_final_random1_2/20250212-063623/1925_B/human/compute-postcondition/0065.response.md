Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is 3, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true, if \(x - n \times i \geq 0\) and \((x - n \times i) \% i == 0\) holds. Otherwise, the conditions remain as in the precondition.
