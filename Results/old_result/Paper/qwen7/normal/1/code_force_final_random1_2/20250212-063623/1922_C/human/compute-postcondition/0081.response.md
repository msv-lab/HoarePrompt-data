Output State: **`i` is `i + 1 + 2`, `d1[i + 2]` is set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers**

Explanation: 
- The initial state had `i` as `i + 1`. After executing `i + 2`, `i` becomes `i + 3`.
- The line `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` is set to the value `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Here, `i + 2` is now `i + 3` and `i + 1` is `i + 2`.
- The condition `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
- The list `l` remains a list of integers without any changes.
