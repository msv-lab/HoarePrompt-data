Output State: **`i` is `m - 2`; `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is decremented by 1, which changes its value but does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `cnt_b[a[i]]`. The value of `i` is updated to `m - 2` because it was previously `m - 1` and was decremented by 1. The conditions and states of `n` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` remain unchanged.
