Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Current values of the variables**:
   - `x` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 9
   - `m` is at least 7
   - `y` is 1
   - `cnt` is 15 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment)

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with current values**:
   - Substitute the current values into the loop condition:
     \[
     (x + y) * x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) * y \leq m
     \]
     \[
     (3 + 1) * 3 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (3 + 1) * 1 \leq m
     \]
     \[
     4 * 3 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 4 * 1 \leq m
     \]
     \[
     12 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 4 \leq m
     \]

4. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - For the condition \(12 \leq n\) to be true, `n` must be at least 12.
   - For the condition \(4 \leq m\) to be true, `m` must be at least 4. However, since `m` is already stated to be at least 7, this condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop condition is met.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 3, `n` must be at least 12, `m` is at least 7, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 15**
