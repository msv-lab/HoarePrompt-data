Postcondition: `n` is the value from `test_cases`, `a` is the second value from `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `current_year` is updated based on the condition `current_year % ai == 0`. If the condition is true, `current_year` is set to `ai`, `next_year` is set to `2*ai`, and `results` is a list containing `ai`. If the condition is false, `current_year` is set to `ai`, `next_year` is set to `(ai // ai + 1) * ai`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one, `ai` is the first element of `a`, and `current_year % ai != 0`.
