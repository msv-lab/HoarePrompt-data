Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `l`, `ans` is a list containing characters from the `alp` list, where each character's index is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array` minus 1 for each iteration of `j` from 0 to `l-1`, and `i` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(input())` takes an input, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `l`. This changes the value of `l` to the input integer. The other variables (`j`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
