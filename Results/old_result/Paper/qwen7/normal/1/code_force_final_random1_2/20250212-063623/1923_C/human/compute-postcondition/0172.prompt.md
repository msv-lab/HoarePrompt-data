Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `j` will be the count of 1's in the list `l`, `p` will be a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of `l`, and `c` will be a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1's in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i)` is true, then no changes are made to `m`. Otherwise, `m` remains greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from the input, and the following holds: if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is satisfied. Otherwise, no additional constraints are imposed on `s - (b - a + 1)` beyond it being non-negative.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
