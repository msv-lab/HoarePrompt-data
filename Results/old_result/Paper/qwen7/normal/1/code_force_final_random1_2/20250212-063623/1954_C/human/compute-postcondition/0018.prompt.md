Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the input string, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the new input string, `new` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values, `new2` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the input string, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the new input string, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `b`, `new` is a list where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, `new2` is a list where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of `a` and `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `i + 1`, `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` for the loop to execute one more time, `new2[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `i + 2`, `new[i-1]` is the maximum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, `new2[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
