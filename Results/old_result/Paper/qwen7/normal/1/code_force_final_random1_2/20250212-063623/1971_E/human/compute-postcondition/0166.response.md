Output State: **`i` is now 3; `bd` includes the new element `b[3] - b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 3. The new element added to `bd` is `b[3] - b[2]`. The value of `b` remains unchanged, and the previous state of `bd` (which included `b[2] - b[1]`) is maintained.
