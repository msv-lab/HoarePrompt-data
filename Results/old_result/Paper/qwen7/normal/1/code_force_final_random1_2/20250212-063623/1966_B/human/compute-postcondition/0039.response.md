Postcondition: `gr` is a grid, and `impossible` remains `False`. If the first element of row `i` is not equal to the first element of row `i + 1`, or the last element of row `i` is not equal to the last element of row `i + 1`, `impossible` remains `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `False` as well.
