Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is a string representing an integer.
   - `y` is a string representing an integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the input string.
   - `b` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the new input string.
   - The first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `b`.
   - `new` is a list where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of `a` and `b`.
   - `new2` is a list where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
     - `i < len(a)` must hold.
     - `a[i] == b[i]` must hold.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (or higher) such that `i < len(a)` holds.
   - Additionally, the elements at index `i` in lists `a` and `b` must still be equal for the second condition to hold.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to increment `i` to 2 (or higher).
   - Ensure that `a[2] == b[2]` (or `a[i] == b[i]` for the next valid `i`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the elements in lists `a` and `b` at the new index `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be 2 (or higher), `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]` for the loop to execute one more time.**
