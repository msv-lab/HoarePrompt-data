Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `time` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `time < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input.
   - `time` is 1 or 2.
   - `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input.
   - `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `comand` is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `time` is currently 1 or 2, for the loop to continue, `time` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `time` should be 2 or 3 (depending on the current value).
   - `t` remains the same as it is the total number of iterations specified by the user.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `time` and `t`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- If `time` was 1, then for the next iteration, `time` becomes 2.
- If `time` was 2, then for the next iteration, `time` becomes 3.

Since `t` does not change, it remains the same.

### Final State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `time` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3**
