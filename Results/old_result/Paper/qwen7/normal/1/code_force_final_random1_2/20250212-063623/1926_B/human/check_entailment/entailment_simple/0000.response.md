Reasoning:
1. The problem requires identifying whether the '1's in the grid form a square or a triangle.
2. The provided code does not correctly identify the shapes. Here's why:
   - The code counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.
   - It then checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".
   - This logic is flawed because:
     - For a square, the counts of '1's in each row will be the same (k consecutive '1's in each row).
     - For a triangle, the counts of '1's in each row will increase by 2 (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - The code does not check the pattern of '1's to determine if they form a square or a triangle.

Given this analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
