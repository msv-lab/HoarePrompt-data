Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string representation of `i`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pd[i]` is increased by the value of `int(j)`.
   - `i` is the string `i` without its last character.
   - `j` is the next character in the string representation of the new `i`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the next character in the string representation of the new `i`, after removing the last character from `i`, `j` will be the first character of the updated `i`.
   - `i` will now be the string `i` without its last character.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `pd[i]` will be updated based on the current `i` and the next `j`.
   - `i` will be the string `i` without its last character.
   - `j` will be the first character of the updated `i`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`pd[i]` is increased by the value of `int(j)`, `i` is the string `i` without its last character, `j` is the first character of the updated `i`**.
