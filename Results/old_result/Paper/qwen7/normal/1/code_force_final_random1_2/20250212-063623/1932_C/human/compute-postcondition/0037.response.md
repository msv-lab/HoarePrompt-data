Output State: **`v` is the last element of `b`, `p` is `p * v % m`, `ans` is a list with two elements where both elements are `p`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with the last element of `b` (which is now stored in `v`) and taking the modulus with `m`. The values of `v` and `p` are updated, while `ans` remains unchanged as it was already set to `[p, p]`.
