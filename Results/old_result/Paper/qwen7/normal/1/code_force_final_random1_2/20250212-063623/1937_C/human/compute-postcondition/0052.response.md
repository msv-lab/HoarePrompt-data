Output State: **`res` is '<', `k` is `i`**

Explanation: The code `k = i` assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Since the initial state only mentions `res` but does not provide a value for `i`, we keep `i` as is. The value of `res` remains unchanged as it was initially set to the string input from the user, which is '<'.
