Based on the initial state provided, `ops` is a non-empty list. However, the lengths of the list (`l`) and the specific value to increment (`r`) are not explicitly stated. Since the problem does not provide these values, we cannot determine the exact numbers to be printed.

Given the format required, we need to describe the output in terms of the variables involved:

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l is the length of the list ops and r is an unspecified value used for indexing or another purpose)**
