Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increases the value of `curr` by 1. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
