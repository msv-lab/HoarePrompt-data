Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, `sb` contains the number `1` appended with the value of `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, otherwise `sb` remains unchanged. `sb` now includes the value `3` since `sb.append(i)` was executed with `i` being `3`.**

In this output state, `sb` has been updated to include the value `3` because `sb.append(i)` was executed, appending the current value of `i` which is `3`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or the conditions they had before the code was executed.
