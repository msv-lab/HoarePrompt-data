Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is an index such that `i + 2 < n`.
- Either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'No'`.

Since no variables or objects need to be evaluated to determine the output, the print statement will directly output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
