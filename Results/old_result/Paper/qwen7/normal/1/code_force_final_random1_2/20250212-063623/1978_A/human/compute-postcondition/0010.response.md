Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**.

This means that the value of `t` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive). The value of `n` is now the integer input by the user. The value of `nums` remains unchanged as it was initialized before the code snippet and is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
