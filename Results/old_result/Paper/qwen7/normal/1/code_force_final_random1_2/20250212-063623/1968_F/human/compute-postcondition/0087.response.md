Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 11`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' as its last element, `n` must be at least 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is now assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `r` in `v2` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` as the index of the leftmost insertion point of `r` in `v2` minus 1. This does not affect the values of `idx`, `t`, `results`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, or `v2`. It only updates `it2` based on the values of `r` and `v2`.
