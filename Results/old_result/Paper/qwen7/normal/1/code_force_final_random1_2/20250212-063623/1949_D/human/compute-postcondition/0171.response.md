Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS', `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` attempts to add the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. However, the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not provided in the initial state, and it is not specified what type of data `xx` is (e.g., list, array). Given that `j` is 2, `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[i][1]`. Since `nx` is initially either 'F' or 'S', adding another 'F' or 'S' to `nx` would result in either 'FF' or 'FS'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
