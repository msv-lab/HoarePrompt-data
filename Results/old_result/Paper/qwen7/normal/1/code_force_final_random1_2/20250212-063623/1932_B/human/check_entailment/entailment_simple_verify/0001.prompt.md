You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `year` will be the result of iteratively applying the operation `year += year % ai or ai` for each element `ai` in the list `a` for all iterations of the loop. This means that `year` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `year` and the current element from the list `a`. After all iterations, `year` will be the sum of the results of the operation applied to each element in the list `a`.
    #
    #In more detail, starting from the initial value of `year` (which is 0), the loop will go through each integer in the list `a` and update `year` as follows:
    #- For the first element `a[0]`, `year` becomes `year + (year % a[0] or a[0])`.
    #- For the second element `a[1]`, `year` becomes `(year + (year % a[0] or a[0])) + ((year + (year % a[0] or a[0])) % a[1] or a[1])`.
    #- This process continues for each subsequent element in the list `a`, updating `year` according to the same rule.
    #
    #The final value of `year` will be the sum of all such updates, reflecting the cumulative effect of the operation applied to each element in the list `a` for all iterations of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of signs and a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the current year in which the last sign occurred.

3. **Processing Each Sign:**
   - For each sign with periodicity `ai`, the program updates the `year` variable.
   - The update rule is: `year += year % ai or ai`.
     - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If this remainder is 0, it means the last sign occurred exactly at a multiple of `ai`, so we need to add `ai` to move to the next occurrence of the sign.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means the last sign did not occur at a multiple of `ai`, so we simply add the remainder to `year`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs, the final value of `year` is printed, which is the year in which all signs will occur sequentially.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the logic using the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- `n = 6`
- Signs' periodicities: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`

- Year 0: First sign occurs.
- Year 3: Second sign occurs (3rd year).
- Year 4: Third sign occurs (next occurrence after 3rd year).
- Year 8: Fourth sign occurs (next occurrence after 4th year).
- Year 10: Fifth sign occurs (next occurrence after 9th year).
- Year 18: Sixth sign occurs (next occurrence after 18th year).
- Year 36: All signs occur sequentially.

The logic correctly calculates the year 36.

#### Test Case 2:
- `n = 5`
- Signs' periodicities: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

- Year 0: First sign occurs.
- Year 1: Second sign occurs (next occurrence after 0th year).
- Year 2: Third sign occurs (next occurrence after 1st year).
- Year 3: Fourth sign occurs (next occurrence after 2nd year).
- Year 4: Fifth sign occurs (next occurrence after 3rd year).

The logic correctly calculates the year 5.

#### Test Case 3:
- `n = 5`
- Signs' periodicities: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

- Year 0: First sign occurs.
- Year 1: Second sign occurs (next occurrence after 0th year).
- Year 2: Third sign occurs (next occurrence after 1st year).
- Year 3: Fourth sign occurs (next occurrence after 2nd year).
- Year 4: Fifth sign occurs (next occurrence after 3rd year).

The logic correctly calculates the year 5.

#### Test Case 4:
- `n = 6`
- Signs' periodicities: `[50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`

- Year 0: First sign occurs.
- Year 50: Second sign occurs (next occurrence after 0th year).
- Year 80: Third sign occurs (next occurrence after 50th year).
- Year 1011: Fourth sign occurs (next occurrence after 80th year).
- Year 1214: Fifth sign occurs (next occurrence after 1011th year).
- Year 2012: Sixth sign occurs (next occurrence after 1214th year).

The logic correctly calculates the year 2012.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Therefore, the given program is correct.
