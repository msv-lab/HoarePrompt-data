Output State: `i` is 400005; `pd[400004]` is the sum of digits of `pd[400003] + 4`; `pd[400005]` is the sum of the digits of `pd[400004]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be the next integer after the last iteration, which is 400005. The value of `pd[400004]` remains as it was updated in the previous iteration, which is `pd[400003] + 4`. Now, `pd[400005]` will be the sum of the digits of `pd[400004]`. This final state represents the culmination of the loop's operations, where `i` reaches the upper limit `N`, and `pd` is updated according to the rules defined within the loop.
