The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `k` is `i`. The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n`.

Given that `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is now `i_end + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be `i_end + 2` and `n` must be greater than `i_end + 2`.

State: **`res` is a string from the input, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `k` is `i_end + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i_end + 2`**
