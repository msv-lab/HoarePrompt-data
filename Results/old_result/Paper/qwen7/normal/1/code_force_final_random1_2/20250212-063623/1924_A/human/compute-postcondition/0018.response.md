Output State: **`cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `ans` is `ss`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `ss`. The other variables (`cur_ss`, `cur`, and `cnt`) retain their previous values. Specifically, `cur_ss` remains as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` stays at 0, and `cnt` is updated to `cnt + 1`.
