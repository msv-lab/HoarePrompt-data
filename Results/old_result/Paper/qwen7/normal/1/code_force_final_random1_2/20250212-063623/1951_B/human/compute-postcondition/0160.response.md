Output State: **`i` is the third element of the list `s`, `s` is a list, and `z` is 1; `ans1` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans1` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value which is assumed to be 0 (since no initial value is given). After the increment, `ans1` becomes 1. The other variables (`i`, `s`, and `z`) remain unchanged.
