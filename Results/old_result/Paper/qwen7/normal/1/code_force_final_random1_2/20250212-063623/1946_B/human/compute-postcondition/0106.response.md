Output State: **`i` is `n`, `sm` is either equal to `suf[i] - smin[i]` if the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111` is true, or `sm` remains unchanged (equal to -111) if the condition is false.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Since `i` is initially `n`, `sm` will now be equal to `suf[n] - smin[n]` if the condition `suf[n] - smin[n] > sm or sm == -111` is true. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged and is still equal to -111. The values of `i` and `n` remain the same as the initial state, and the condition for `sm` is updated based on the new value of `sm`.
