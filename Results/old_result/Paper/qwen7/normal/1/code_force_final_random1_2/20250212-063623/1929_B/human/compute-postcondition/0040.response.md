Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes values for t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers between 2 and \(10^8\) and 1 and \(4n - 2\), respectively. It returns a result based on these values.**
