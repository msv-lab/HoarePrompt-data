Given the initial state, we know that `k` is defined as `4 * n - 2`. We need to determine the value of `k // 2 + 1` and then print it.

Let's break it down:

1. `k` is given by the formula `4 * n - 2`.
2. We need to compute `k // 2 + 1`.

First, let's express `k // 2`:
\[ k // 2 = \frac{4 * n - 2}{2} = 2 * n - 1 \]

Then, adding 1 to this result:
\[ k // 2 + 1 = (2 * n - 1) + 1 = 2 * n \]

So, the expression `k // 2 + 1` simplifies to `2 * n`.

Output: **2 * n**
