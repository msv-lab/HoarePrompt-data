Postcondition: `a[i]` is an element of array `a`, and `b_values` is a collection of elements. If `a[i]` is found in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not found in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `curr`.
