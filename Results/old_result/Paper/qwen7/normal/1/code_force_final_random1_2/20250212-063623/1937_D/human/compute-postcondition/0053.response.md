Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n-1-j`
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `A` is a list of integers
   - `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear
   - `B` is a list of integers
   - `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and now `idx_B` includes the index `i` if `s[i] == '<'`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented to 3 (assuming `n` is greater than or equal to 3).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n-1-3` (since `j` is now 3).
   - `j` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no specific modifications are mentioned, we assume they stay the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is equal to `n-1-3`, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and now `idx_B` includes the index `i` if `s[i] == '<'`**
