Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(n/2 - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is `n / 2`; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`.**

Explanation: The code `o = sl.count('1')` calculates the number of '1's in the list `sl` and assigns it to the variable `o`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
