Postcondition: `even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least one element, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` retains its previous value, `ans` remains unchanged (as `y` is less than half of `gap` and thus does not affect `ans`), and `y` retains its previous value which is less than half of `gap`.
