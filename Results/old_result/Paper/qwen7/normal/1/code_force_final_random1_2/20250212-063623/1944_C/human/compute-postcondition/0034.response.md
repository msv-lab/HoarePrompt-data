Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is 4.
- `vis` is a set containing the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
- `nums[4]` is either 0 or None, since it was decremented by 1 during the last iteration and the loop condition no longer holds.

The `print(start)` statement will print the value of the variable `start`.

Output: **4**
