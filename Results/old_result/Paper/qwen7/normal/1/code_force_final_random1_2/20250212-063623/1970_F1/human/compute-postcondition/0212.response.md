Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t`: The integer value of the first line read from standard input.
   - `time`: The value is explicitly given as `2`.
   - `command`: A list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input.
   - `obj`: The first element of the `command` list.
   - `com`: The second element of the `command` list.
   - `comand`: A list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input (same as `command`).
   - `pos`: The value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.
   - `nxt`: A tuple equal to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]`: The value is explicitly given as `False`.
   - `team`: The result of the function `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values for the variables used in the print statement:

- `time`: Explicitly given as `2`.
- `team`: This is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`. Since `pos` is an element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, and `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, it implies that the player at position `obj` is not a player (possibly a goal post or something similar). The function `goalIn(pos)` would return the team associated with that position. Without knowing the exact implementation of `goalIn(pos)`, we can denote the team as `team`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **2 team GOAL** (where `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`).
