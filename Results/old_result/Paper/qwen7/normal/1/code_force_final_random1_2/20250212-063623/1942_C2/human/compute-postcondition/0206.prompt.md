Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The variable `even` is sorted, `ans` remains equal to 3, the sets `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `even`, and `odd` remain unchanged, and the lists `even` and `odd` contain all valid `gap` values that satisfy the conditions within the loop. Specifically, `even` contains all gaps greater than 0 and even, while `odd` contains all gaps greater than 1 and odd. The values of `next_elem` and `gap` will be as defined by the last iteration of the loop, where `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The list `odd` is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `gap` is the first element in the `odd` list, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `y` + `gap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, and `gap` remains as the second element in the `odd` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is increased by the value of the third element in the `odd` list plus 2 times the value of `y` minus the third element in the `odd` list, `y` is 0, and `gap` is the third element in the `odd` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
