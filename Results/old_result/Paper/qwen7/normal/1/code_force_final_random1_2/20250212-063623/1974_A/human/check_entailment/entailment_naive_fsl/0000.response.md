Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the number of 2x2 icons is greater than half the total number of cells available on a single screen (which is 15). For example, consider the case where there are 8 2x2 icons and 0 1x1 icons. According to the problem description, the minimum number of screens needed should be 2, but the program incorrectly calculates it as 1.

To illustrate, let's consider the following input:
```
1
8 0
```

The program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because 8 icons of size 2x2 would require 2 screens since each screen can only hold 4 such icons.

A corrected version of the program should properly account for the number of 2x2 icons and ensure that the remaining space is filled optimally with 1x1 icons.
