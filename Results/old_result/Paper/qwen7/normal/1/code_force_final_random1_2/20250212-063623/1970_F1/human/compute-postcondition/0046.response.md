Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. Otherwise, `goal[tmp]` is a list containing one tuple `(0, 3)` if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`. If `line[ind][1] != 'G'`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
