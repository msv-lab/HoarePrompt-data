Output State: **`total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is calculated based on `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1`; we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `total_points`, `egalites`, `p3`, and `resultats` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
