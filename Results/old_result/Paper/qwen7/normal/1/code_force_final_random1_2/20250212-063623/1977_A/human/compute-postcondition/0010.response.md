Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `m` is the second integer input by the user.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- The current value of `m` is greater than the current value of `n`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the string `'No'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`, and it only prints a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **No**
