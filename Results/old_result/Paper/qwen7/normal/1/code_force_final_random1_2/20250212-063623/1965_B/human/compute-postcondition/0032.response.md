Output State: **`ans` contains the elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^{lk-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`**

The code appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. Since the initial elements of `ans` are given as `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^{lk-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1]`, after appending `2 * k + 1`, the updated list becomes `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^{lk-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
