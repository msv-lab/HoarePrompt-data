Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `count[num]` is decremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value of `count[num]` by 1. Since `num` is the first element of `a` and `a` must have at least one element, the value of `num` is still valid. The precondition that `num` is in `count` remains true, and the value of `count[num]` is decreased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
