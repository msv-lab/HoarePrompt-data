Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-7`, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is updated to include the current value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` remains equal to `n-7`, `j` remains 3, `n` must still be greater than 0, `A` and `idx_A` retain their original lists of integers and indices respectively, and `B` and `idx_B` are updated to include the new index value of `i`.
