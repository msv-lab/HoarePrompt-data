Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 1, `flag` is False, and `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1**.

Explanation: The line `flag = False` sets the variable `flag` to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `s`, `count`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
