Output State: **`j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m-1]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][m-1]`, `i` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The line `impossible = False` changes the value of the variable `impossible` from its initial state of `False` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
