Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `x` is a list of integers obtained from another input string, `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a string input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
