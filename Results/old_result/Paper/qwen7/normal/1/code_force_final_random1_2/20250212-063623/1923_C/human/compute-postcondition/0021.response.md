Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the new first element of the list `l`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of `x`, `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1, `p` is a list containing the value of `i` appended, `c` is a list containing the value of `j` and the updated value of `j` appended.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. The other variables (`l`, `x`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `j` is updated if the new `x` equals 1, but since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we keep it in the form of "the new first element of the list `l`".
