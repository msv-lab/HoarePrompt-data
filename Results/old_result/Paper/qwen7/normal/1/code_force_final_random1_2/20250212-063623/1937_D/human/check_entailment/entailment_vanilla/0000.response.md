Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement is determined by the characters in the string `s`, where `<` means move left and `>` means move right. After each move, the direction at the current cell is reversed.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - The code uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results for the left and right traversals respectively.
   - The logic for computing the time involves iterating through the string `s` and using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time for each cell.

3. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly handles the left traversal by storing the cumulative times in array `A`.
   - The code correctly handles the right traversal by storing the cumulative times in array `B`.
   - The main loop in `func_1` correctly computes the time for each cell by combining the left and right traversal times.
   - The logic for handling the boundary conditions (when the pinball reaches the edge of the grid) is also correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the pinball starts at the edge of the grid.
   - The code handles the case where the pinball moves in a single direction without reversing.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
