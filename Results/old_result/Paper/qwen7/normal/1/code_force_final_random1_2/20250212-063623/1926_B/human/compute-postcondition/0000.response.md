Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 2 ≤ a ≤ 10.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and now `a` holds the number of test cases, which is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive. All other conditions and constraints remain valid for each test case.
