Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2 (if it was 1, otherwise 3), `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list with one element which is equal to `arr[0] * feat[2]`. If `arr[0] < b / a`, then the first element of `array2` is `arr[0] * feat[2]`.**
