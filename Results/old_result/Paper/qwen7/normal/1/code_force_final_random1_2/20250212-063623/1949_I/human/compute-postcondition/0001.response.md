Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `x[0]` to `x[n-1]` are all `None`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `x` of length `n` filled with `None`. The values of `n`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged from their initial state.
