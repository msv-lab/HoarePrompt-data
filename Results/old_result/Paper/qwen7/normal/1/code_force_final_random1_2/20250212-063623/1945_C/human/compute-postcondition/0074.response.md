Output State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, and `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `lst` will be empty because each element that satisfies the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` has been appended to `final`. The variable `mini` will hold the smallest value of `abs(pk - elem)` for any `elem` in the original `lst`. Finally, `final` will contain all elements from the original `lst` that have the minimum difference with `pk`.
