Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is equal to (y + 1) // 2, `m` is 15 * z - y * 4.**

Explanation: The code calculates `m` based on the values of `z` and `y`. Since `z` is defined as `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is computed as `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
