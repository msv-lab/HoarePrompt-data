Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `j` is 0; `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

The code `b = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `b`. The values of `t` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
