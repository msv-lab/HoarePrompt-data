Output State: **`start` is 2; `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, and 2; `nums[start]` is decreased by 1.**

Given the initial state where `start` is 2 and `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, and 2, the code snippet `nums[start] -= 1` decreases the value of `nums[start]` by 1. Since `start` is 2, it specifically modifies `nums[2]`. The values of `start` and `vis` remain unchanged, but `nums[2]` is decreased by 1.
