Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - If `s[i]` is 'L', then `b` is a list with two elements where the second element is the same as the first element.
   - Otherwise, `b` is a list with one additional element from `a[r]` and `r` is decreased by 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts from 0).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop body based on the given conditions.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer**
