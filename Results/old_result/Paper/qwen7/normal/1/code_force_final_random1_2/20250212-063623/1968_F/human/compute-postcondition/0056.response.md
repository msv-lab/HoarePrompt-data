Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is now a list containing 'YES' and possibly other elements, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and the condition `(it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l))` is true.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends 'YES' to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially either an empty list or a list containing 'YES', after appending 'YES', `results` will now definitely contain 'YES' and may contain other elements as well. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their previous states.
