Output State: **`i` is `n-2`; `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` using the formula `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is initially `n-2`, which means `i` is greater than or equal to 0 as per the initial state. The values of `l` and `d2` are updated according to the given formula, while other variables remain unchanged.
