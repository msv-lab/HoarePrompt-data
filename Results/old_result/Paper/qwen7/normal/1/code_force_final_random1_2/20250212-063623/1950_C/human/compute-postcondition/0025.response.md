Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 1440\).
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `h` is the first two characters of the input string `s`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `h` is '00', no changes are made to `t`, `s`, or `h`.
   - If `h` is not '00', no changes are made to `t`, `s`, or `h`.

3. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
   ```

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

- `s[2:]`: This slice operation will return the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end of the string.
- `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`: This expression checks if the integer value of `h` is greater than or equal to 12. If it is, it returns 'PM'; otherwise, it returns 'AM'.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `h`, we need to consider both cases:

- **Case 1**: If `h` is '00'
  - No changes are made to `t`, `s`, or `h`.
  - `s[2:]` will be the substring of `s` starting from the third character.
  - `['AM', 'PM'][int('00') >= 12]` will evaluate to `['AM', 'PM'][0]`, which is 'AM'.
  - Therefore, the print statement will output: `s[2:], 'AM'`.

- **Case 2**: If `h` is not '00'
  - No changes are made to `t`, `s`, or `h`.
  - `s[2:]` will be the substring of `s` starting from the third character.
  - `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` will either be 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the value of `int(h)`.
  - Therefore, the print statement will output: `s[2:], 'AM'` or `s[2:], 'PM'`.

Since the exact value of `h` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of the second part of the tuple. However, we know it will be either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]**
