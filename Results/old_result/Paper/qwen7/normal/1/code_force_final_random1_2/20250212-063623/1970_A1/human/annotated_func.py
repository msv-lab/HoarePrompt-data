#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between infoA's balance and infoB's balance, where both balances are integers.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where both `balance` attributes are equal, and `position` represents the position of a character in a parentheses sequence
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, infoA and infoB, which are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`. Depending on the values of these attributes, it returns either the difference between infoA's balance and infoB's balance if both are integers, or the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `balance` will be the final balance calculated after processing all characters in `s`, `n` will be the length of `s`, and `balance_info` will be a list containing an instance of `BalanceInfo` for each iteration of the loop. Each instance in `balance_info` will have its `balance` updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, the current value of `i`, and the character `s[i]`. The `balance` value will reflect the net count of unmatched opening parentheses '(' minus closing parentheses ')' after processing all characters in `s`.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is a string containing the characters from each BalanceInfo instance in the sorted balance_info list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", processes it to maintain a record of the balance of parentheses at each position, sorts this information based on the balance and position, and finally returns a string containing the characters from each recorded balance information in the sorted order.
