Postcondition: **`i` is now `elements[line[ind + 1]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuples `(i, ind + 1)` and `(i, ind)`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block. It ensures that regardless of whether `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true or false, the final state of the variables `i`, `ind`, `n`, `line`, and `goal[tmp]` remains consistent with the provided postconditions.
