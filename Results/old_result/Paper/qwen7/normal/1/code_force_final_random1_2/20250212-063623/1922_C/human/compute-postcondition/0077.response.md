Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the difference between `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is greater than or equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1]`; `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains 1, `n` must still be greater than 1, and the condition regarding the difference between elements in list `l` still holds. Additionally, `d1[i + 2]` (which is `d1[3]` given `i` is 1) is now assigned the value of `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` (which is `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`).
