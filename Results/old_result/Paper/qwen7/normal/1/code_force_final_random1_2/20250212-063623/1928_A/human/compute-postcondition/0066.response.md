Based on the initial state and the code snippet provided:

1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
2. `a` and `b` are integers entered after a space.
3. `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`.
4. `b1` and `b2` are both set to `b // 2`.
5. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the loop continues until `b1` equals `a`, at which point the function terminates with the updated values of `a` and `b`.

The code snippet ends with `print('No')`.

Since the loop condition is based on `b1` being equal to `a`, and the code snippet only contains the `print('No')` statement without any further execution, it implies that the loop does not execute because the condition is not met or the loop terminates immediately due to the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
