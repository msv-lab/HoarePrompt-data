Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.**

The code calculates `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `mn` is created and assigned the value of `min(a, b) + m`.
