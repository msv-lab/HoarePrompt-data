Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list named 'results' containing `t` elements. Each element in 'results' represents the value of 'missing', which is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`.**

This means the function processes `t` iterations, each involving a tuple from `test_cases`. For each iteration, it calculates `missing` based on the given `n`, `m`, and string `a`, and adds the result to the list `results`.
