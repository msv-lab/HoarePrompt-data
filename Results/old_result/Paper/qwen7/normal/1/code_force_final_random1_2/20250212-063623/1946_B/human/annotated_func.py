#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State: The final value of `sm` is calculated as described in the problem statement, but it will be the result after processing all `t` inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `l` of `n` integers. It calculates a specific value `sm` based on the list `l` and the integer `k`. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of `sm` for each case. The value `sm` is computed using suffix sums and minimum suffix sums, adjusted according to the given formula, and then possibly adjusted further based on its sign.
