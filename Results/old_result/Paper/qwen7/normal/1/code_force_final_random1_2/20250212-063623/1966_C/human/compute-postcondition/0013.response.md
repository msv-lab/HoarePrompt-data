Output State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0, `dp` is the result of `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is equal to `n`.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `tc` remains greater than 0. The variable `n` remains as the length of `arr` minus one. The list `arr` stays as a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by a zero. The variable `dp` is now the final result of the expression `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`. The variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, which is the upper limit of the loop's range.
