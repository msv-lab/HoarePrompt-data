Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `b` remains unchanged if `l - r - 1 <= 0`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for `b` remains the same as the initial postcondition, meaning if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is updated; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
