Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_elem` based on the condition given. If `i` is equal to `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is set to `a[0] + n`. Otherwise, `next_elem` is set to `a[i + 1]`. After setting `next_elem`, `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The values of `x` and `i` are incremented, and the conditions for `odd` and `even` lists remain unchanged based on the new value of `gap`.
