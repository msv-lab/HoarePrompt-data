State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute even once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The problem statement specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
4. Since `t` is used as the argument to `range()`, it directly controls the number of iterations of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and within the specified range.
