Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is 'aaa', `i` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code appends `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to the string `word`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n - 3` will be an integer between -2 and 97. Assuming `alphabet` is a list of lowercase English letters (i.e., `['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z']`), `alphabet[n - 3]` will be the character corresponding to the index `n - 3`. However, since `word` starts as an empty string and we append `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`, `word` becomes `'aaa'`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1.
