#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

        freq = [0] * 7

    #State: `freq` is a list of 7 elements representing the total count of characters from 'A' to 'G' across all strings `a` in `test_cases`. `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`. `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each iteration of the loop, totaling `t` elements.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' which contains 't' elements. Each element in 'results' represents the value of 'missing' calculated for each iteration of the loop, where 'missing' is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between 'm' and each value in 'freq'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of problem difficulties ('A' to 'G') in the given string, determines how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement for the next 'm' rounds, and sums these values to produce the result for that test case.
