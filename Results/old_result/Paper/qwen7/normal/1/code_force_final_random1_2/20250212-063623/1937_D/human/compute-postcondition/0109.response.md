Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', with the following conditions:
- If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, and `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- If `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, then `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and if `r` is 0, `r` remains 0. If `r` is not 0, then `b` is equal to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise the conditions remain as initially stated.
