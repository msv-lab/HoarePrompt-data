Based on the initial state provided:

- `numTest` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers where:
  - Each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`.
  - Each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by `2 * opNum`.
  - Each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`.
- `stop` is `True`.
- `i` is `n-5`.
- `opNum` is now equal to `a[i+1]` and `a[i+1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`.
- `a[i+2]` is decreased by `opNum`.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
