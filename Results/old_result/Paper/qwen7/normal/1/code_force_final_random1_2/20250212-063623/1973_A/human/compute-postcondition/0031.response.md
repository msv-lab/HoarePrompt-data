Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing one element which is `egalites // 2`**.

In this output state, the value of `egalites` is divided by 2 and appended to the list `resultats`. All other variables retain their initial relationships and values as specified in the initial state.
