Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with its first character removed, `cur` is incremented by \(1 << cur_ss\) if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is met and `cur` is not equal to \(2^k - 1\); otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged; `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is equal to the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation: 
- The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1.
- The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `cur_ss`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions unless they are explicitly modified within the given code snippet.
