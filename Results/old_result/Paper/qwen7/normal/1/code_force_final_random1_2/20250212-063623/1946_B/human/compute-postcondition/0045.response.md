Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` will increment by 1.

3. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The condition `suf[1] - smin[1] > sm` or `sm == -111` must hold true for the condition to remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - The condition `suf[1] - smin[1] > sm` or `sm == -111` must still hold true for the condition to remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and maintain the condition as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, the condition `suf[1] - smin[1] > sm` or `sm == -111` must hold true.**
