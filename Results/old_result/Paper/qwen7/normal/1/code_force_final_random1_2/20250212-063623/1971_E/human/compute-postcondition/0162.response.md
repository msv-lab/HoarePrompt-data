Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive element in `a` from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The list `ad` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, starting from the second element (`a[1]`) down to the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`).
