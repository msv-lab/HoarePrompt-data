Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `zero` is 1 or 0, `zero_perc` is 0, `i` is 2, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` contains the element 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `zero` is either 1 or 2; `zero_perc` is 100 or 50; `i` is 3; `one_perc` is -400; `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3; `zero_perc` is 100; `i` is 4; `one` is 1; `one_perc` is -300; `lst` contains the elements 2, 4, and 5; `o` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
