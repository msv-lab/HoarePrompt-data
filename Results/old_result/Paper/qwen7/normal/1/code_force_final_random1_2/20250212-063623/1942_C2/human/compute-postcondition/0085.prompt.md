Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2 but is even, then `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. In both cases, the values of `a`, `i`, `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` satisfy these conditions, and if the difference is neither 2 nor an even number, the values of `a`, `i`, `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is either 2 or 3. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is 1. If the condition `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` is false, then `y` is updated based on the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. If the condition is true, `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`. If the condition is false, `y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is either 3 or 4, if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise `ans` is updated based on whether `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and the value of `y`. If the condition is met, `y` is decreased by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, otherwise `ans` and `y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
