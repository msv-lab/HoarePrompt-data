Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of test cases, followed by n integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it sorts and processes the unique stones in descending order. It then determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on specific conditions involving the differences between consecutive stones. The function prints either "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends with all relevant variables reset or updated according to the final state of the loop.**
