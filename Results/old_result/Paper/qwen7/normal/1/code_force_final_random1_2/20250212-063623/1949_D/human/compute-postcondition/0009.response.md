Output State: **`x` is the input string or integer entered by the user, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, after the execution of the code, `j` becomes 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
