You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `ar`. For each test case, it computes a new list `res` where each element `res[i]` is calculated based on the maximum excluded number (`mex`) and the corresponding element in `ar`. Specifically, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged. Finally, it prints the elements of `res` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A result list `res` of size `n` is initialized with `None` values.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the maximum value that can be used as MEX initially.

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then checks if `mex > mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - The result list `res` is printed as a space-separated string.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Backward Iteration Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` is correct.
   - However, the check `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is redundant because `mex` is always greater than or equal to `mex - ar[i]` due to the nature of MEX being the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX calculation should ensure that the value assigned to `res[i]` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix of `res` up to index `i`.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the MEX calculation because it only decrements `mex` without ensuring that the value is not already in the prefix.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `5`
  - Array: `[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - Expected Output: `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

  - For `i = 4`: `res[4] = mex - ar[4] = n - 2 = 3` (since `mex = 5`)
  - For `i = 3`: `res[3] = mex - ar[3] = 4 - 1 = 3` (since `mex = 4`)
  - For `i = 2`: `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 3 - (-2) = 5` (since `mex = 3`)
  - For `i = 1`: `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 2 - 1 = 1` (since `mex = 2`)
  - For `i = 0`: `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 1 - 1 = 0` (since `mex = 1`)

  - This results in `res = [0, 1, 5, 3, 3]`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the MEX calculation and thus produces incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
