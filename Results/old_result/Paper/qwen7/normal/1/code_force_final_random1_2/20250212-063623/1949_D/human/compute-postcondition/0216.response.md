Output State: **`i` is 2, `nx` is either 'FFF' or 'FSF' or 'SFF', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Given the initial state where `nx` can be 'FF', 'FS', or 'SF', appending 'F' to each of these results in 'FFF', 'FSF', or 'SFF' respectively. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and the condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
