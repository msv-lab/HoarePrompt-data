State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because the `range(n)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `i` must be initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as the `range(n)` function will increment `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

The initial value of `t` (a positive integer between 1 and 1000) does not affect the execution of the loop and can remain unchanged.
