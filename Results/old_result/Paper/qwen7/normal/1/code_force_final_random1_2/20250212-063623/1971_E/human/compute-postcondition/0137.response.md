Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using `bisect_left`, `l` is 3, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `ql`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `s`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
