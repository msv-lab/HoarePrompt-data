Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical flaw. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function checks if the last column of the first row and the second-to-last column of the second row both point left (`<`). This is incorrect because the robot can still reach the bottom-right corner even if these conditions are not met. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   >>>
   >><
   ```
   In this case, the robot can start at (1, 1), move right to (1, 2), and then move down to (2, 2). From (2, 2), the robot can move right to (2, 3) and finally down to (2, 4).

2. **General Path Analysis**: The function only checks a subset of possible paths and does not account for all valid movements. It incorrectly returns 'No' in scenarios where the robot can indeed reach (2, n).

To illustrate, let's consider the test case:
```
4
>>>
>><
```
The provided function would incorrectly return 'No', but the correct path is:
- Start at (1, 1) -> Move right to (1, 2) -> Move down to (2, 2) -> Move right to (2, 3) -> Move down to (2, 4).

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
