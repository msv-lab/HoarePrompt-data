Postcondition: `aOnes` is either 0 or incremented by 1 for each iteration where `i` is found in `a` and does not exceed `newk`, `bOnes` is either 0 or incremented by 1 for each iteration where `i` is found in `b` and does not exceed `newk`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, and the loop has executed all iterations where `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.
