Output State: **`queue` is not empty; `current` is the first element of `queue` before calling popleft; `dist` is the second element of `queue` before calling popleft.**

Explanation: The code `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the first element from the `queue` and assigns its first two elements to `current` and `dist`, respectively. After executing this line, the `queue` will no longer contain these first two elements, but it is still not empty since other elements might remain.
