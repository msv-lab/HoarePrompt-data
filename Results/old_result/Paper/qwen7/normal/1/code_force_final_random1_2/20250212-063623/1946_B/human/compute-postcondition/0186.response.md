Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, `sm` is 4 % (10 ** 9 + 7)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by taking its modulus with \(10^9 + 7\). Given that `sm` is initially 4 and is greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `sm` remains 4 because \(4 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 4\). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
