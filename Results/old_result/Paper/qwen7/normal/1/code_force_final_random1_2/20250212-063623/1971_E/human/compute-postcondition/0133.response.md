To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression for `m`.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using `bisect_left`.
   - `l` is 2.

2. **Expression for `m`:**
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - To evaluate this, we need the values of `b`, `bd`, `ad`, and `ql`.

Since the values of `b`, `bd`, `ad`, and `ql` are not explicitly provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can describe it based on the given formula.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(int(m), end=' ')`.

Given the formula for `m`, the print statement will output the integer value of `m`.

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
