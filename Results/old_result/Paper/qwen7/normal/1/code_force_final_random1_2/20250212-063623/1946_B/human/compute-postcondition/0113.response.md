Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n + 1`, and `sm` is the maximum value among `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `n`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = n + 1`. During each iteration, it updates `sm` if the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111` is met. Since the loop runs for all possible values of `i` within the specified range, `sm` will end up being the highest value found among `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all these `i` values. If no such value exists (i.e., all values are less than or equal to `-111`), `sm` will remain `-111`.
