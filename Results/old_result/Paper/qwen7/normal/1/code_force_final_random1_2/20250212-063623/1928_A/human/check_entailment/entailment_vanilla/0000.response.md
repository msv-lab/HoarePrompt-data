Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - It then processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Conditions for Printing 'yes' or 'no':**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine whether Bob can form another rectangle:
     - If both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`), it prints 'yes'.
     - If `a` and `b` satisfy specific conditions related to subtraction and modulus operations, it prints 'no'.
     - If the conditions do not match the above, it prints 'yes'.

3. **Conditions for 'no':**
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` seems to be incorrectly formatted and does not make sense as written. It should likely be a comparison without the tuple construction.
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant since `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1, and the logical OR operation with 0 or 1 will always evaluate to `True`. Therefore, this condition will always result in 'yes'.

4. **Correct Conditions:**
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If both `a` and `b` are even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting them into smaller even-sized rectangles.
     - If `a` and `b` are such that one is odd and the other is even, Bob cannot form another distinct rectangle.
     - If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle.

### Correct Implementation:
Based on the problem description, the correct logic should be:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, print 'yes'.
- If one of `a` or `b` is odd, print 'no'.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem. It includes unnecessary and incorrect conditions. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
