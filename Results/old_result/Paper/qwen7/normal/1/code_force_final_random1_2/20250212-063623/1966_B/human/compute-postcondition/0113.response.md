Output State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'NO'**.

The code appends the input to the list `gr`. Since the input is not specified, we denote it as the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
