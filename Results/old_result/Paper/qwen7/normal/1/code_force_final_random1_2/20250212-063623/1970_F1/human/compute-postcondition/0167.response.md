Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input.
   - `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index specified by `obj`.
   - `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element.
   - `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is not a player's piece.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `time` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `player` depends on the value of `obj` and the result of `isPlayer(obj)`. Since the exact value of `obj` and the contents of `mov` and `isPlayer` function are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `player`. However, we know it will be either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is not a player's piece.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **0 [player] ELIMINATED** (where [player] is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is not a player's piece).
