Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `len(final)` is 0, then `final` now either contains an additional element `0` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or includes the element `n` if `c1` is less than 50.
