Output State: **`ops` is a list containing two tuples, where the first tuple is `(c1, i)` and the second tuple is `(c2, i)`; `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met, and the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, and the length of `path_ba` is at least 2.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `c2` is defined as half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is defined as `c2 - 1`, the list `ops` now contains two tuples: the first tuple is `(c1, i)` and the second tuple is `(c2, i)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
