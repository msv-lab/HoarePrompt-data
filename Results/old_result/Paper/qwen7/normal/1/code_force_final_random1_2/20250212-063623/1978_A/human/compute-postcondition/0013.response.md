Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 1 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 1 and then decremented to 0, meaning the loop will have completed all its intended iterations. At this point, `t` will be 0, which is still considered greater than 0 but will be the lowest possible value within the given range (1 to 500). The values of `n` and `nums` will depend on the inputs provided during the last iteration of the loop.
