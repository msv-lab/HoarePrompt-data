### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - Both players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them as is.
   - After each turn, one coin is removed from the current player's wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially boils down to the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because:
     - On Alice's first turn, she removes one coin, making the total odd.
     - On Bob's turn, he can always swap wallets back to make the total even again.
     - This process continues until there is only one coin left. At that point, the player whose turn it is will be forced to remove the last coin and lose.
   - If `a + b` is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the total to remain odd after her turn, ensuring she wins.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it returns 'Bob', otherwise 'Alice'.
   - This function correctly implements the logic derived from the key insight above.

4. **Main Function Analysis**:
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1()`.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the provided examples, we notice that the function `func_1(a, b)` does not actually simulate the game dynamics accurately. Instead, it simply checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` and returns the winner based on that. This is a simplification and does not account for the actual game mechanics where players can swap wallets and remove coins in each turn.

To verify this, let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

- **Example 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - According to the game rules, Alice cannot make a valid move since her wallet is empty after removing one coin. Thus, Bob wins.
  - However, `func_1(1, 1)` returns 'Bob' because `(1 + 1) % 2 == 0`.

- **Example 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
  - Alice can swap wallets, making `a = 4` and `b = 1`. Then Bob can swap back, making `a = 1` and `b = 4`. This process continues until Alice is forced to remove the last coin, making her lose.
  - However, `func_1(1, 4)` returns 'Alice' because `(1 + 4) % 2 != 0`.

These examples show that the function `func_1(a, b)` does not correctly simulate the game dynamics and instead relies on a simplified parity check, which is not sufficient to determine the winner based on the actual game rules.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the actual game dynamics. It only checks the parity of the total number of coins, which is insufficient to determine the winner in all scenarios.

### Final:
**False**
