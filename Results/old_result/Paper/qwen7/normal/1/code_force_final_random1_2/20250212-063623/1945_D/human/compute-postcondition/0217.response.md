Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, the value of `a_values[y - 1]` plus `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]` plus `a_values[0]`, and the current value of `y` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but simply exits the loop or conditional block. All the conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.
