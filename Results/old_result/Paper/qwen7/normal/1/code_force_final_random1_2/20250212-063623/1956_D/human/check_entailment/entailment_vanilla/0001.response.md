Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to ensure that all elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` are set to the value `r - l + 1`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The function checks if `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`. If not, it updates the subarray and calls itself recursively on the right part of the subarray starting from `l + 1`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list (`ops`) and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - It returns the sum of the array and the number of operations performed.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function aims to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively maximizes the sum on both sides of the maximum element.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the result.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It ensures that all elements in the subarray are set to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - However, there is a small issue: if `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`, the function should not append `(l, r)` to `ops` because no operation is needed.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The base case where the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is handled correctly.
   - The recursive case where the sum is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` also seems correct. It splits the subarray at the position of the maximum element and recursively maximizes the sum on both sides.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function to maximize the sum.
   - It returns the correct values: the sum of the array and the number of operations.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results correctly.

### Conclusion

The provided program is almost correct but has a minor issue in `func_1` where it unnecessarily appends operations when `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of the solution since the operations are still valid and the sum is maximized correctly.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
