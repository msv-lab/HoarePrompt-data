Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `lst[a]` now contains the elements it had before plus `b`.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list at index `a` in the list `lst`. Since `a` is an input integer, it refers to a specific index in the list `lst`. The value of `b` is added to the list at that index. The conditions and values of `x` and `a` remain unchanged.
