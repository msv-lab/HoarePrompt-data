Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `True`, and `j` equals `m - 1`. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is set to `True`.
