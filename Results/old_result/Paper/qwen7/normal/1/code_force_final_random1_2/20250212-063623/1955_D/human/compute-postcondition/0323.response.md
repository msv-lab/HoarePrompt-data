Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `i` in `b_values`.

2. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `i` in `b_values`, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to one of the values in `b_values`.
   - The variable `i` should be such that it can take on any value from `b_values`.

3. **Check Initial State:**
   - From the given state before the loop, `i` is currently set to `n - m - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be one of the values in `b_values`.

4. **Ensure Validity of `b_values`:**
   - `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` can be one of these values.

5. **Final State Before Loop Execution:**
   - `i` should be set to one of the values in `b_values`.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be one of the values in `b_values`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is one of the values in `b_values`**
