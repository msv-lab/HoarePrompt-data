Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to set all elements in a specified range `[l, r]` to the value `r - l + 1` if they are not already equal to this value. It also handles the base case where `l == r` by setting the single element to zero if it's not already zero. This ensures that the subarray is filled with the smallest possible value that is not present in the subarray, which aligns with the definition of MEX.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and then returns the sum of the array, the length of the operations list, and the operations list itself. It correctly uses `func_1` to modify the array and record operations, ensuring that the array is modified according to the problem requirements.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function attempts to maximize the sum of a subarray by either setting all elements to the maximum value in the subarray or recursively processing the left and right parts of the subarray. It correctly identifies when to set all elements to the maximum value and when to split the subarray into smaller parts to further maximize the sum. This function ensures that the sum of the subarray is maximized while adhering to the constraints.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the necessary outputs, and prints them in the required format. It correctly handles the input and output as per the problem statement.

Given the detailed execution summaries and the logical structure of the functions, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Each function plays a specific role in ensuring that the array is modified to achieve the maximum possible sum using the allowed operations.

Correctness: **True**
