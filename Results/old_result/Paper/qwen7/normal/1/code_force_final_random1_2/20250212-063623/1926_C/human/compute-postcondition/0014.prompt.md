You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is the sum of all digits of the initial `num`, `num` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all iterations, `num` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues to divide `num` by 10 until it reaches 0. During each iteration, the last digit of `num` is added to `a`. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `a` contains the sum of all the digits of the original `num`.
    return a
    #The program returns 0 since the initial value of `num` is 0, and there are no digits to sum.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter num, which is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5, and returns 0 because the initial value of num is 0 and there are no digits to sum.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 0 since the initial value of `num` is 0, and there are no digits to sum.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
