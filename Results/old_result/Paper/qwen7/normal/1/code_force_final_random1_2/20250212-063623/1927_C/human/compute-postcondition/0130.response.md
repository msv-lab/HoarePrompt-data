Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 2, 1, or 0, `i` is 3, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `k` must be at least 3.**
