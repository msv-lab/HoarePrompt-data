Output State: **`l` is the list with its last two elements removed and the first element set to the third last element of the updated list, `x` is the last element of the original list before the modification**.

Explanation: The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. Given the initial state where `l` is modified such that its last element was removed and the first element was set to the second last element of the updated list, after executing `l.pop(-1)`, the first element of `l` is now set to the third last element of the updated list (since the last element was already removed). The variable `x` retains its value as the last element of the original list before the modification.
