Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `new[i-1]` is the maximum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, `new2[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the minimum between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, which was already stated in the initial state. The value of `new[i-1]` remains unchanged as it was defined in the initial state and was not affected by the current line of code.
