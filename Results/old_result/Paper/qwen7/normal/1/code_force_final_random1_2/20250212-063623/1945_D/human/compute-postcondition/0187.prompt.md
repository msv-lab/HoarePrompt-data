Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `na_frente` is the value it was before minus 2, `pos_final` is an integer input from the user minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to integer, `best` is 10000000000.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `total` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and `best` is unchanged if it is greater than the respective total value after considering whether to `trocar_a[v]` or `passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, the same conditions apply without changing `best`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and `best` remains unchanged if it is greater than the respective `total` value after considering whether to `trocar_a[v]` or `passar_b[v]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
