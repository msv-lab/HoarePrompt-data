Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves in the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All neighbors of the starting node 'start' have been visited, and the `queue` contains tuples for each visited neighbor with their respective distances from the start node.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: The `queue` contains tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended to the end of the original queue each iteration, with `neighbor` being nodes in the tree that are yet to be visited and `dist + 1` representing the distance from the start node to `neighbor`. `current` is the node currently being processed, which is the first element of the tuple that was `popleft`ed from `queue`. `dist` is the second element of the tuple that was `popleft`ed from `queue`, representing the distance from the start node to `current`. All visited nodes are stored in the set `visited`. The loop continues until all nodes in the tree are either visited or there are no more neighbors to process for the current node.

This final state represents the complete traversal of the tree starting from the initial node, with `queue` holding all unvisited nodes in order of their distance from the start node, and `visited` containing all nodes that have been processed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: All elements directly connected to the initial `current` node through paths of increasing distance have been added to the `queue`, and these elements are marked in the `visited` set.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
