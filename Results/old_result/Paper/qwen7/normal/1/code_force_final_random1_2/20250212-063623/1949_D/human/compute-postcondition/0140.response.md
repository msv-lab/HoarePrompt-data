Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `sa` is a list containing the integer 1, `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0.**

Explanation: The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 1, to the list `sa`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sa` now contains the integer 1, while `sb` still contains the single integer 0.
