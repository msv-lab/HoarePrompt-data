Output State: **`num` must have at least one element, and `i` will iterate over each element in `num`. The current value of `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the conditions and values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
