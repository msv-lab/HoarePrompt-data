Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `p` is a list containing the single element 0, `c` is a list containing the single element 0.**

The code initializes two variables `i` and `j` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
