Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is 'az', `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value remains the same.**

Explanation: The code appends `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` to the `word` variable. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n - 28` will be an integer between -27 and 72. Assuming `alphabet` is a list containing all lowercase English letters (i.e., `['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z']`), `alphabet[n - 28]` will be a single character from the alphabet list. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, `n - 28` will be a valid index for the `alphabet` list, and the corresponding character will be appended to `word`. The specific character is `'a'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet list, followed by `'z'`. Therefore, `word` becomes `'az'`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and the input value) remain unchanged.
