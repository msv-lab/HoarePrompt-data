Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, and `power` is equal to `n-1`**

Explanation: The value of `power` is decremented by 1, starting from the initial value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, `power` becomes `n-1`. The precondition that `n` is an integer greater than 1 remains unchanged.
