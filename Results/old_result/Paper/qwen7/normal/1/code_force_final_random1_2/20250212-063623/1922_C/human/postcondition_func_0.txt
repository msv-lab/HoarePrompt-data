The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), a strictly increasing list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, an integer \( m \), and \( m \) pairs of integers \( (x_i, y_i) \). For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference based on two dictionaries \( d1 \) and \( d2 \), which are constructed from the list \( a \). Specifically, for each query \( (x_i, y_i) \), it computes and outputs the difference according to the values in \( d1 \) and \( d2 \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
