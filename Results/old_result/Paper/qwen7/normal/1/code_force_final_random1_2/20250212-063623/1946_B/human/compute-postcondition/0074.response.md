Output State: **`sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus \(10^9 + 7\) or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), depending on whether `sm` is less than 0; `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\); `j` is `t`; `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers; `suf` is now [0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, `l[0] + l[1] + l[2]`]; `i` is 5**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i] + l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is 4, we calculate `suf[4]` as `l[0] + l[1] + l[2]`. Therefore, `suf` is updated to include this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
