Output State: **`len(b)` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `v` contains the value `[ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3]]`**

Explanation: The code `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the first element appended to `v` is `ad[1] / bd[1]`. After the append operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (since `i += 1` is implied), making `i` equal to 3. Therefore, the next value appended to `v` is `ad[3] / bd[3]`. The length of `b` remains at least 1, and `i` is now 3.
