Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the input to initialize the field, players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle.
   - The `func_1` function is defined to handle movements, and it appears to be implemented correctly.

2. **Game Execution**:
   - The program iterates through each step of the game and processes the actions accordingly.
   - For each action, it updates the positions of the players and the Quaffle.
   - It handles player elimination correctly when a player and a Bludger are in the same position.
   - It correctly identifies scoring events and updates the scores and the Quaffle's position.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the events in the correct order, including scoring events and eliminations.
   - It correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic seems to be correctly implemented. The program processes each action, updates the state of the game, and prints the appropriate events and the final score.

Correctness: **True**
