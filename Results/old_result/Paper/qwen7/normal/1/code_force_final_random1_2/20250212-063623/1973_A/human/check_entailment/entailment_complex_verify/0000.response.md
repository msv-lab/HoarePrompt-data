### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. We need to ensure that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for each set of scores.

1. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program starts by checking if the total points are even. If not, it immediately returns -1, which is correct because an odd total points cannot be achieved by any combination of win-lose and draw games.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points in total (either 2-0 or 1-1).

3. **Checking Validity**:
   - The program checks if the total matches are more than 3 or if `p3` is greater than the total matches. If either condition is true, it returns -1, which is correct because these conditions indicate an impossible score distribution.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula accounts for the points contributed by the differences in scores between the players. The number of draws is then `egalites // 2`.

Let's manually verify the logic for the problematic case (1, 1, 2):

- **Case (1, 1, 2)**:
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\)
  - Total matches: \(4 // 2 = 2\)
  - Differences: \(p3 - p2 = 1\), \(p3 - p1 = 1\)
  - Points from differences: \(2 \times (1 + 1) = 4\)
  - Remaining points for draws: \(4 - 4 = 0\)
  - Number of draws: \(0 // 2 = 0\)

This manual calculation shows that the program should return 0 for the case (1, 1, 2), not -1. The original assessment incorrectly states that the program returns -1 for this case, but the annotated code and the logic in the program suggest that it should return 0.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly handles the case (1, 1, 2) and returns 0, not -1.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
