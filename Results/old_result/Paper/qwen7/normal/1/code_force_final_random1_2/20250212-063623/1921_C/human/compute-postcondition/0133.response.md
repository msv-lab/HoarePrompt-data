Output State: `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the original length of `arr`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `array2` is a list. After all iterations of the loop, `array2` will contain elements based on the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, if `i` is 0, `array2` will include `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`. For any other index `i`, `array2` will include `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. If neither condition is met for any iteration, the corresponding element will not be added to `array2`.
