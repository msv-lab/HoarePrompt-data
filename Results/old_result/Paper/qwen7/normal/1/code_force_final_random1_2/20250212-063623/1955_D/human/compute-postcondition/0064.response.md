Postcondition: `i` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` only if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1 (only if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative), and no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` if `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`.
