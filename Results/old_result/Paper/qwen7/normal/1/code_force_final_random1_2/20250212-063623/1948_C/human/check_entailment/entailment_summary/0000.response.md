Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program only checks for specific conditions where the robot might get stuck and does not fully explore the path the robot can take through the grid. Specifically, the program only checks for a few specific cases where the robot cannot progress, but it fails to consider other possible paths the robot could take.

To properly solve the problem, the program should simulate the robot's movement according to the arrows in both rows and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n). The current implementation only checks for certain invalid configurations and does not validate the entire path.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
