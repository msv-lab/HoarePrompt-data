Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 1 or 0, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 0, `i` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, or `i` is not in `b` or `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**
