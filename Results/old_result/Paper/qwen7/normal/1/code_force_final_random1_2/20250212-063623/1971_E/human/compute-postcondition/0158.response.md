Output State: **`i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2]]`**

Explanation: The initial state is `i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`. The code snippet appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`. Therefore, the new value appended to `ad` is `a[3] - a[2]`. So, `ad` now contains both `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`.
