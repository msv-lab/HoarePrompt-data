Output State: **`j` is 1, `gr` is a 2D list where either the first row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the first row, or the last row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the last row, and `impossible` remains `False`**.

Explanation: The variable `impossible` is explicitly set to `False`. No other changes are made to the variables `j` or `gr`. Therefore, the values of `j` and `gr` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `impossible` is now explicitly set to `False`.
