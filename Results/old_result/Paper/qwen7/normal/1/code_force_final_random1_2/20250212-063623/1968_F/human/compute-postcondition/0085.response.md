Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 11`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' as its last element, `n` must be at least 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is now assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `v2` to be the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`. This means `v2` is now assigned the value of the list obtained from the dictionary `mp` using the key `pf[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
