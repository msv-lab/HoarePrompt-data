Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

2. **Analyze each variable in the loop condition**:
   - `rest`: For the loop to execute, `rest` must be non-zero.
   - `pos`: For the loop to execute, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `rest` is reduced to `k`: This means `rest` is some value that has been reduced to `k`. To ensure the loop executes, `rest` must be non-zero. Since `rest` is reduced to `k`, `k` must be non-zero.
   - `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`: This means the loop can already execute based on the given state because `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

4. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - `rest` must be non-zero. Given that `rest` is reduced to `k`, `k` must be non-zero.
   - `pos` is already less than `len(sorted_indices)`, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`rest` is reduced to `k` (k must be non-zero), `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`**
