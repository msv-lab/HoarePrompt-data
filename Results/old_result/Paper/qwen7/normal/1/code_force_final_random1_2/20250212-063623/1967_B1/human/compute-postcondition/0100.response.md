Output State: **`count` is 5, `countmins` is 4, `ans` is `n` + (int(`n` / 2) / 2) + 1 + int(`n` // 3 / 3) + 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `t + 1, `g` is now `n` // 3, `g` is updated to int(`n` / 5)**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated to the value of `int(n / 5)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
