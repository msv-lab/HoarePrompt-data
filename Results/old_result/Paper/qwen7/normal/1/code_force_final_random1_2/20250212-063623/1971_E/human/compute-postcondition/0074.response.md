Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `l` will be equal to 2 because the loop runs from `l = 0` to `l = q - 1`. Given that `q` is an input integer, `l` will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `q - 1`. The variable `m` is updated in each iteration based on the formula `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`. The variable `i` remains 1 because the loop does not change its value within the loop body. The variable `s` is determined by the `bisect_left(a, ql)` function call, and `ql` is continuously decremented by `a[s - 1]` in each iteration.
