Output State: The loop will execute exactly `func_10()` times, which from the given information is known to be 3. Each iteration of the loop writes a positive integer to `sys.stdout`. The integers written follow a specific pattern: the first integer is greater than 1, the second is greater than 2, and the third is greater than 3. Since `func_10()` returns 3, the loop will write three lines to `sys.stdout`, with each line containing a positive integer greater than the previous one.

To summarize, the output will consist of three lines, each containing a unique positive integer starting from at least 2 and increasing by at least 1 for each subsequent line. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all iterations will be:

```
2
3
4
