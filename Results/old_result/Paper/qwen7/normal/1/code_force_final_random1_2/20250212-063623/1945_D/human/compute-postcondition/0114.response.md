Output State: **`total` remains the same if `v - 1` is greater than `pos_final`; otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `v` is updated to `v - 1`, `na_frente` remains unchanged, `best` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `total` will be updated only if `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. In that case, `total` is set to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `best` is also updated to this new value. The value of `v` is updated to `v - 1`, while `na_frente`, `best`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
