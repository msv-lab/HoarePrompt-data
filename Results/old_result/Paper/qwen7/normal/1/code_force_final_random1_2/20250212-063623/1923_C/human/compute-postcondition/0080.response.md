Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next integer in the list, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`**.

This means that the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `l`, `x`, `i`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their previous states.
