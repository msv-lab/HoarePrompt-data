Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `i` and the input value used to determine the range.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will run for each integer in the range from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`. This means that `i` will take on values from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `j` is equal to `m - 1`.
   - `x` and `y` are integers from the input split for each iteration of the loop.
   - `d1` and `d2` are unchanged from their initial state.

4. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that for each iteration:
   - `x` and `y` are integers from the input.
   - If `y` is greater than `x`, `y` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `y` also remains unchanged.
   - `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged.

5. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `j` will be `m - 1` for the next iteration as well.
   - `x` and `y` will be new inputs for the next iteration.
   - `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged.

Given that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `int(input())`, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `j` will be `m - 1`.
- `x` and `y` will be new inputs.
- `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged.

Since we don't know the exact values of `x` and `y` for the next iteration, we can only say that they will be new inputs.

**Final State:**
State: **`m` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are new integers from the input, `d1` and `d2` are unchanged from their initial state.**

However, since we need to specify the exact state for the next iteration, we can represent it as follows:

**State:**
State: **`m` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are integers from the input (new values), `d1` and `d2` are unchanged from their initial state.**
