Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 5`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`**.

This means that the variable `l` is now assigned the integer value of `data[idx]`, where `idx` is `n + 5`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
