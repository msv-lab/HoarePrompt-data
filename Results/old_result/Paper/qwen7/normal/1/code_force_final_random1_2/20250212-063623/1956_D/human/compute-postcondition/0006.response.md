Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `ops` is a non-empty list.
- The for loop statement is: `for (l, r) in ops:`

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `l` and `r`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `ops` is a non-empty list.
3. **Previous Iteration State**: `ops` is a non-empty list.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial State**: `ops` is a non-empty list.
2. **Loop Execution**: During each iteration, the loop takes the first pair `(l, r)` from `ops`.
3. **After First Iteration**: After the first iteration, `ops` will no longer contain the first pair `(l, r)`, meaning `ops` will now be a list that is still non-empty but has one element less than before.
4. **Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute again, `ops` must still be a non-empty list. Since it was non-empty at the end of the previous iteration, removing one element still leaves it as a non-empty list.

### Updated State
- `ops` remains a non-empty list (since it was non-empty and we removed only one element).
- No specific values for `l` and `r` are mentioned, so they are not adjusted in this context.

### Final Answer
State: **`ops` is a non-empty list**
