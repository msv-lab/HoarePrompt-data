Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `A` is a list containing 0**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `A`. Since `A` was not defined before, it is assumed to be a list (or initialized to an empty list) after this operation. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
