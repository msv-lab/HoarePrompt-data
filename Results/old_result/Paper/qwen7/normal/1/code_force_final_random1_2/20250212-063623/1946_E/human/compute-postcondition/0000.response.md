Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple is (m1, m2, n), `c` is a variable assigned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)` call, `d` is a variable assigned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)` call.**

Explanation: The code assigns the return values of the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that these variables now hold the results of the function call. The initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
