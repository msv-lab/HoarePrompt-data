Output State: **`zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] == '0'` is false, otherwise `one` remains unchanged, and `zero_perc` is updated based on the new value of `zero`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` using the formula `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `zero` is increased by 1 before this line, the value of `zero` used in the calculation is the new value. The other variables (`i`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc`) remain as they were, except that `one` might have been incremented if the condition `s[i] == '0'` was false. `zero_perc` is recalculated based on the updated value of `zero`.
