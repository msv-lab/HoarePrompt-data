Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value from `data` at index `idx` to the variable `t`. Since `idx` was initially 0, `data[idx]` refers to the first element of the list `data`, which is expected to be an integer `t`. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented to 1 to point to the next element in the list. The value of `t` is converted to an integer, and the initial state of `data` remains unchanged except for the fact that `idx` has moved to the next element.
