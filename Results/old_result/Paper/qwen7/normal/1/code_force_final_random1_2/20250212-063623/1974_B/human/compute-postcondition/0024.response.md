Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `j` is either `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) + 1`; `unique_chars` is updated to insert `char` at index `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if `i` was initially 2, it becomes 3. The values of `j` and `unique_chars` remain unchanged from their initial states.
