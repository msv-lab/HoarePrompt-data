You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `year` will be the result of iteratively applying the operation `year += year % ai or ai` for each element `ai` in the list `a` for all iterations of the loop. This means that `year` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `year` and the current element from the list `a`. After all iterations, `year` will be the sum of the results of the operation applied to each element in the list `a`.
    #
    #In more detail, starting from the initial value of `year` (which is 0), the loop will go through each integer in the list `a` and update `year` as follows:
    #- For the first element `a[0]`, `year` becomes `year + (year % a[0] or a[0])`.
    #- For the second element `a[1]`, `year` becomes `(year + (year % a[0] or a[0])) + ((year + (year % a[0] or a[0])) % a[1] or a[1])`.
    #- This process continues for each subsequent element in the list `a`, updating `year` according to the same rule.
    #
    #The final value of `year` will be the sum of all such updates, reflecting the cumulative effect of the operation applied to each element in the list `a` for all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple values through a list of integers `a` for each test case defined by `t` and `n`. For each test case, it processes `n` integers `a_i` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and returns a result based on these integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
