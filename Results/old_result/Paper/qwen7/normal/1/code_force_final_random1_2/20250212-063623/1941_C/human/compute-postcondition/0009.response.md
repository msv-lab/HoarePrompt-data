Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`**.

Explanation: The code `x = s.count('map')` counts the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `x`. The values of `a` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
