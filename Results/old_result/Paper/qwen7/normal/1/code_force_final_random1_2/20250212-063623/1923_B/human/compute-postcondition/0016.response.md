Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more inputs left to process. For each iteration, `n` will be the first integer from the input split by space, `k` will be the second integer from the input split by space, `a` will be a list of integers obtained from the input string, and `x` will be a list of integers obtained from another input string using map and split functions. The variable `t` will decrement by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.**

This means that after all iterations, `t` will be 0, signifying the end of the input processing. For every iteration, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` will be as described above based on the current input, but these lists and integers will be specific to the input processed during that particular iteration.
