### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) of integers from 0 to \( n-1 \) such that for each index \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution uses a reverse loop to fill the result array `res`.
   - It initializes `mex` to \( n \), which is the maximum value that can be used for the MEX operation.
   - For each index \( i \) from \( n-1 \) to 0, it sets \( res[i] = \texttt{mex} - ar[i] \).
   - It then updates `mex` to ensure it remains the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `res`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to be correct because:
     - By setting \( res[i] = \texttt{mex} - ar[i] \), we ensure that the MEX condition holds for each position.
     - The reverse loop ensures that the MEX calculation is done correctly for each prefix of the array.
     - The update of `mex` ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `res` is maintained.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where the initial `mex` is set to \( n \), ensuring that the smallest non-negative integer not present is correctly identified.
   - The solution also handles the case where the array `ar` might contain negative values, which do not affect the construction of the permutation as long as the MEX condition is satisfied.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The solution outputs the permutation `res` in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The given solution appears to correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

**Correctness: True**
