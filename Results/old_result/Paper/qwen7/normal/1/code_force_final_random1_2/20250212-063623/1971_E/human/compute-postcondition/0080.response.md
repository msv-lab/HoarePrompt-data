Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest are integers inputted from the user, `b` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest are integers inputted from the user, `ad` is a list containing only one element which is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ad = [0]` initializes the list `ad` with a single element, which is 0. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
