Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 11`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES', 'NO' as its last elements, `n` must be at least 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is now assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `r` in `v2` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code appends 'NO' to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The `results` list now contains 'YES' followed by 'NO'.
