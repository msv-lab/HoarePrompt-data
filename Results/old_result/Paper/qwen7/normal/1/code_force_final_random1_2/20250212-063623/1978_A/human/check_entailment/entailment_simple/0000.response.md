Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to solve the problem by taking the maximum value from all but the last element of the list of book pages (`nums[:-1]`) and adding it to the last element (`nums[-1]`). This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that the books are divided into two non-empty piles optimally. The goal is to maximize the sum of the maximum values from the two piles, not just to take the maximum value from all but the last element and add it to the last element.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following steps:
1. Sort the list of book pages in descending order.
2. Split the sorted list into two parts: the first part and the second part (excluding the last element).
3. Sum the maximum values from these two parts.

However, the provided code does not implement these steps. Instead, it simply takes the maximum value from all but the last element and adds it to the last element, which is not guaranteed to give the optimal solution.

Therefore, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
