Output State: The variable `t` remains the same as its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, since the loop runs `t` times. The variables `n` and `m` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` is the first integer input by the user, and `m` is the second integer input by the user during the last iteration. The output of the loop depends on the values of `n` and `m` during the last iteration:

- If `n` equals `m`, the output is 'Yes'.
- If `m` is greater than `n`, the output is 'No'.
- If `m` equals `n - 1`, the output is 'Yes'.
- If both `m` and `n` are even, the output is 'Yes'.
- If both `m` and `n` are odd, the output is 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, the output is 'No'.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, and the final output of the loop is determined by the values of `n` and `m` from the last iteration.
