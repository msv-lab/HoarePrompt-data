Output State: **`d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes as specified by the input during each iteration of the loop, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of calling `func_1` with `d` as its argument to the variable `b`. The values of `d`, `previous`, and `u2vs` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new state includes the assignment of `b` as the result of `func_1(d)`.
