Output State: **`total` is 0, `v` is 0, `c` is `c` (one more than the previous value of `c`), `pos_final` is one less than the original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `total = 0` sets the variable `total` to 0. All other variables (`v`, `c`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
