Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1` and `v` must be greater than `-1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. The other variables (`na_frente`, `n`, and `v`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
