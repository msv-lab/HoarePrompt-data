Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and calculates a sequence of integers stored in the list `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to tile a 2 × i rectangle with 1 × 2 dominoes and 2 × 2 squares, modulo 1000000007. After calculating up to `dp[n]`, the function does not return any specific value.**
