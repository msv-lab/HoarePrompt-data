Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` must be greater than 1; `a` and `b` are updated to the values of the first and second input numbers respectively.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It does not affect the values of `i`, `s`, or `m`. Therefore, `i` and `s` remain as `c[b] - c[a - 1]` and `p[b] - p[a - 1]` respectively, and `m` remains greater than 1. The initial values of `a` and `b` are updated to the values of the first and second input numbers, respectively.
