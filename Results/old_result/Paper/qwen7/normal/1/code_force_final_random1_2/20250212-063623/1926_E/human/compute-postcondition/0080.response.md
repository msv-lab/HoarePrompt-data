Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1, 1], `tot` is 2, `pow` is 2**

Explanation: The initial value of `pow` is not given, but typically `pow` is used to denote the power function in Python. However, in this context, it seems `pow` is a variable that was previously assigned a value. The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Since no initial value for `pow` is provided, we assume it was set to 1 (a common default value if not specified) before this line of code. Thus, `pow` becomes 2 after executing the code. All other variables (`a`, `L`, `tot`) remain unchanged.
