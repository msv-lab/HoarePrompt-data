Output State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `j`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
