Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(n/2 - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is `n / 2`; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is an empty list; `o` is 0; `z` is 0; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `lst`. This affects the following variables:
- `lst` is now an empty list.
- Since `lst` is empty, the conditions involving `mini`, `final`, and the calculations involving `n`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `c1`, `t`, `sl`, `zero`, and `one` do not change their initial states because there are no elements in `lst` to affect these variables. Therefore, their values remain as initially stated.
