Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the range function which depends on `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `gr` is a list containing two elements which are the input from the user
   - `i` is 1

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of `n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and not modified within the loop.
   - The values of `tc`, `m`, and `gr` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two elements which are the input from the user, `i` is 2**
