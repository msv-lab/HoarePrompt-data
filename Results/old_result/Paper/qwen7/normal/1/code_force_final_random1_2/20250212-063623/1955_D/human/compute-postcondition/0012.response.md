Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` has taken on all values from `0` to `m-1`. For each `b[i]` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` has been incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `b[i]` in the list `b`. Therefore, `cnt_b` now contains the count of each element in the list `b`.

This means that after all iterations, `cnt_b[j]` (for any integer `j` between 0 and 1000000) will be the number of times `j` appears in the list `b`.
