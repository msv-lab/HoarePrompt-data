Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `l` is 1.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, or `l`.
