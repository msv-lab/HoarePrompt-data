Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the updated `lst`, `final` now contains the first element of the updated `lst`, the element that makes `mini` the minimum value, and `elem`, `lst` now contains all elements except the first element.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the current value of `elem` to the list `final`. This means that `final` now includes the first element of the updated `lst`, the element that made `mini` the minimum value, and the newly appended `elem`. The values of `mini` and `lst` remain unchanged from their previous states.
