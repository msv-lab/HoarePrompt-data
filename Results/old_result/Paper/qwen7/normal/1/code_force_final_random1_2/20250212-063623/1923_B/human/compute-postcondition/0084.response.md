Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `pos` is increased by 1, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - 2*delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta)**

Explanation: 
- The value of `rest` is updated to `rest - 2*delta`.
- The variable `pos` is incremented by 1.
- The condition `pos < len(sorted_indices) - 3` remains true if it was true before the increment.
- The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`.
- The value of `delta` is updated to `min(rest - 2*delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta)`.
