Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved here are `y`, `max_p`, and the range itself.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop runs from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (not including `0`). The variable `y` takes on values starting from `max_p - 1` and decrements by `1` until it reaches `1`.

3. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - `y`: This will take on values from `max_p - 1` down to `1`. We need to ensure that the loop can start with `y = max_p - 1`.
   - `max_p`: This remains unchanged throughout the loop, but we need to ensure it is defined and holds an integer value.
   - The range itself is defined by `range(max_p - 1, 0, -1)`, so we don't need to explicitly adjust anything related to the range definition.

4. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`num_fila`, `b`, `b_values`, `custos`, `custo`, `a_values`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can start. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `y` and `max_p`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1**
