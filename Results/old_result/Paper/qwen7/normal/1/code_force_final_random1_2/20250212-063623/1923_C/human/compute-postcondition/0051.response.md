Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]` updates the value of `i` to be the difference between `c[b]` and `c[a - 1]`. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `p`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
