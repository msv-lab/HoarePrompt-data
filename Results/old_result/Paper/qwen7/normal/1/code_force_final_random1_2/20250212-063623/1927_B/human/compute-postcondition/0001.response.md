Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `l`, `l` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `l`. The variable `i` is described as a non-negative integer starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`, which is now `l`. Therefore, `i` remains within the same range, but `l` now holds the value of the user's input.
