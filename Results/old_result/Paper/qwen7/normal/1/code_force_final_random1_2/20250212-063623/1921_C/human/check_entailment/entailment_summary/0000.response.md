Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message sending moments.
3. The program then calculates the differences between consecutive message sending moments and checks if these differences are less than `b/a`.
4. If the difference is less than `b/a`, it adds the product of the difference and `a` to a new list (`array2`).
5. After processing all differences, it calculates the total cost of turning the phone off and on by summing the values in `array2` and adding the number of such operations multiplied by `b`.
6. It then compares this total cost with the remaining charge `f` after accounting for the number of turns off and on operations.
7. The logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
