To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is:
```
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
```

For the loop to continue executing, both conditions must be true:
1. `rest != 0`
2. `pos != len(sorted_indices)`

Given the postconditions from the previous iteration:
- `rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`
- `pos` is increased by 3
- `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is decreased by `delta`
- If the current value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, then `pos` is further increased by 1.

Let's evaluate each condition:

1. **Condition: `rest != 0`**
   - The value of `rest` has been updated to `rest - 2*delta`.
   - For the loop to continue, `rest - 2*delta` must not be zero. This means `rest` must be greater than `2*delta`.

2. **Condition: `pos != len(sorted_indices)`**
   - The value of `pos` has been increased by 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `pos + 3` must not be equal to `len(sorted_indices)`. This means `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`.

Additionally, we need to consider the potential adjustment due to the check `if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0`:
- If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is increased by 1.
- However, this does not affect the loop condition directly since the loop condition is based on `pos` and `rest`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `rest` must be greater than `2*delta`.
- `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`.

State: **`rest` is greater than `2*delta`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`**
