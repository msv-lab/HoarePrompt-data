Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the step value (which is 2 in this case).

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts from 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - The step value is 2.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time.
   - The initial value of `i` is 1.

5. **Consider the initial values given**:
   - `t` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is the value entered by the user in the input() function (not relevant to the loop).

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the final state should be:
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
