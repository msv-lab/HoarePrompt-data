Postcondition: `i` is 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `l` is 1. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the condition is met as is. If `a[s]` does not equal `ql`, the condition is not met and no changes are made to the variables.
