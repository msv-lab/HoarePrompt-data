Postcondition: `i` is -1, `n - m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and the current value of `a[i]` is either in `b_values` or not. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and is now greater than 0. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `i` remains -1 and no changes are made to `cnt_b`. Additionally, the condition `(a[i + m] in b_values)` is satisfied.
