Postcondition: `zero` is either 1 or 2; `zero_perc` is 100 or 50; `i` is 3; `one_perc` is -400; `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4. Otherwise, the conditions remain as stated in the precondition.
