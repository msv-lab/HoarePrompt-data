Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it checks if any element in the list \( a \) is negative after performing specific operations. If any element becomes negative, it prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. If no element becomes negative and the last two elements of the list \( a \) are zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function returns nothing but prints the result for each test case.**
