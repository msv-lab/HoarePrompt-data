Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` is 3; `num` is a list containing `v`.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `v` is not defined in the initial state or within the code snippet, we can only say that `v` is appended to the list `num`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
