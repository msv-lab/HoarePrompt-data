Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12. According to the problem description, when the hour is 12 in 24-hour format, it should be represented as "12:XX AM" if the original time is before noon (i.e., the hour part is less than 12), and "12:XX PM" if the original time is after noon (i.e., the hour part is 12 or greater).

In the provided code, the condition `if int(h) <= 12:` will include both the cases where the hour is 12 (which should be "12:XX PM") and the cases where the hour is less than 12 (which should be "12:XX AM"). Therefore, the code incorrectly handles the transition from 12 to 1 PM and from 12 to 12 AM.

For example, for the input "12:00", the program outputs "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM". This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
