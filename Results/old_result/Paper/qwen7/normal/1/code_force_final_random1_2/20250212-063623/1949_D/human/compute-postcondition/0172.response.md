Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is 'FF', `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Initially, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'FF' if it was 'F' initially, or 'SF' if it was 'S' initially. However, since the exact initial value of `nx` is not specified beyond being either 'F' or 'S', we can represent the updated value as 'FF' without loss of generality for the given options. All other variables remain unchanged.
