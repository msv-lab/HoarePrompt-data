Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is a string containing the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz', and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz' to the `word` string. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n - 53` will range from -52 to 47. However, list indices in Python start from 0, so the actual valid range for `n - 53` is from 0 to 47 (inclusive). The `i` variable is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state, only that it is incremented. The `word` string is updated with the new value, and `n` remains unchanged within its original range.
