Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, `a_values[0]` is only considered if `y` equals 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only effect is that the loop or conditional block is exited.
