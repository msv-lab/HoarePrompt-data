Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `len(unique_chars) + 1`, `unique_chars` has `char` inserted at index 1, `s` is modified according to the rules specified.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `len(unique_chars)` to `len(unique_chars) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
