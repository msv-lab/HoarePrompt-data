Output State: **`cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `cnt_b` or `a[i]`, the only change is that `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain in their initial state.
