State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` must be 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `t`.
- The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop can execute. For the loop to run, `t` must be a positive integer (since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`, `t` must be at least 1).
- Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), we need to ensure this condition is met.
- Therefore, the state before the loop should reflect that `t` must be within the specified range and `i` must start at 0.
