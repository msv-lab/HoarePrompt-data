Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their preconditions. Specifically, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is still greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` retains its value as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
