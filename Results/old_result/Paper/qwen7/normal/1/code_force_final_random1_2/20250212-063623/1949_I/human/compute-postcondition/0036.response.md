Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `coef[3]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function call is made with the parameter `i` set to 3. However, without the definition of the `dfs` function, we cannot determine any changes to the variables. Since no changes to the variables are explicitly shown in the code snippet provided, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
