Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n` and the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. This means that `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
3. **Update the state for the next iteration**: Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` remains the same

For the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value, `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[n] - arr[n - 1]) * a` if the difference between `arr[n]` and `arr[n - 1]` is less than `b / a`, otherwise `array2` remains unchanged**.
