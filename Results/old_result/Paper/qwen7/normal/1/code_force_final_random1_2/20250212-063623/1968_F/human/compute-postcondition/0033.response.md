Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `data[idx]` converted to an integer; `idx` is increased by 1; `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1]` XOR `a[i]`**.

This means that the value of `a[i]` remains the same as it was initially (converted from `data[idx]`), `idx` has been incremented by 1, and `pf[i]` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`.
