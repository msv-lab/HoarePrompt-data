Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `bipartite` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, `visited` remains unchanged and is still filled with `False`, `coef[i-1]` (which is `coef[n-1]`) is 1, `tot` is 0, and `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is False.**
