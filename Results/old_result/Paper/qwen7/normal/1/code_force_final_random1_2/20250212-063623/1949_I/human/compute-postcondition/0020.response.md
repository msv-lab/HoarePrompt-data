Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, `visited` remains unchanged and is still filled with `False`, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is False.**

Explanation: The line `tot = 0` initializes the variable `tot` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `bipartite`, `i`, `n`, the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`, `visited`, `coef`, and `ok` remain unchanged from their initial states.
