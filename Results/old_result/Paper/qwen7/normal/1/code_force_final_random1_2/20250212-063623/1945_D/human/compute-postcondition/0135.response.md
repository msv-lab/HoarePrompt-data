Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the range for the variable `v` as `range(na_frente, -1, -1)`. This means `v` will take values from `na_frente` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the variable `v` must start within the specified range. Specifically, `na_frente` should be a non-negative integer because the loop will decrement `v` until it reaches `-1`.

3. **List the relevant states to be adjusted**:
   - `na_frente`: It must be a non-negative integer so that the loop can start.
   - `n`: The variable `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head but is implied by the range specification. Since `v` starts from `na_frente` and goes down to `-1`, `n` should be `na_frente + 1` (the number of iterations).

4. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - `total` is already given as `0`.
   - `na_frente` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `pos_final` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers and don't affect the loop condition.
   - `best` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `na_frente` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` must be a non-negative integer, `n` must be `na_frente + 1`**
