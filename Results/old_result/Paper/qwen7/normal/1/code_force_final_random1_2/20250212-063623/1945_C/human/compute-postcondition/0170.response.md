Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(n/2 - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is `n / 2`; `pk` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `pk` is updated to `n / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values. The value of `n` itself is updated to `n / 2`, but the relationship of `c1` and `t` remains as described in the initial state.
