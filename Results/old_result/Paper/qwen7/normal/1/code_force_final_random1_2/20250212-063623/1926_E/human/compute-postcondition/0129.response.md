Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are inputs provided through `input()`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following will be true:

- `t` will be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` will hold the last pair of integers read from the input.
- `s` will be equal to the total number of iterations `i`.
- `d` will be 0.
- `h` will be reduced to 0.
- `p` will be equal to `i`.
- `g` will be the sum of the series \(\left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + \ldots + 1\).
- `f` will be `k - g`.
- `y` will be \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times (k - g) - 1)\) if `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise it will be undefined.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `i` (which represents the total number of iterations) will determine the final values of `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `y`. The values of `n` and `k` will reflect the last input pair processed by the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is simply a count of the total number of test cases.
