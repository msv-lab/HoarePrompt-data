You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The final value of `tc` is `t-1`, `t` remains the same, `n` and `m` remain as their last values entered during the loop's execution, `gr` is a list containing exactly `n` elements, each being a string representing a row of the grid as input during the loop's execution, `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the final evaluation of the conditions inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The grid is composed of cells containing either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, identified by a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function evaluates the grid and returns a specific output based on predefined conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
