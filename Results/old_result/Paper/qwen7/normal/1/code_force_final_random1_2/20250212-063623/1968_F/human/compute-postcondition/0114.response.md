Postcondition: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]`, and `pf[i + 1]` is added to `mp` with an empty list as its value. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`; otherwise, `mp[pf[i]]` remains unchanged. `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[i + 1]`.**
