The function processes a series of test cases, each involving an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each t, it writes three unique positive integers to `sys.stdout` in ascending order, starting from at least 2. The integers written are determined by the `func_15()` function and `func_10()` function, respectively. After completing the loop, the function leaves `sys.stdout` with three lines of output, each containing a distinct positive integer in increasing order.
