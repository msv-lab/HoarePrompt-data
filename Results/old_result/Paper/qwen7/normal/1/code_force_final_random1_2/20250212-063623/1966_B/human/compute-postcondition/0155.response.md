Output State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `False`, and `j` equals `m - 1`.**

The code simply sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
