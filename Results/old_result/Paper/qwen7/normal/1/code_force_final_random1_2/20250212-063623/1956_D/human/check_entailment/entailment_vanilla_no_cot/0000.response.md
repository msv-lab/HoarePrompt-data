Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Names and Definitions**: The function names `func_1`, `func_2`, and `recursive_maximize_sum` are used inconsistently and do not match the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` are not properly defined to handle the problem requirements.

2. **Logic Errors in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - In `func_1`, the base case checks if `a[l]` is not equal to 0, but it should check if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` to ensure the subarray is filled with the correct MEX value.
   - The recursive calls in `recursive_maximize_sum` are not correctly implemented to maximize the sum of the array.

3. **Missing Operations List (`ops`)**: The operations list (`ops`) is not being passed correctly between functions, and it is not being initialized properly.

4. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation and assignment logic are not correctly implemented. The MEX of a subarray should be calculated and then assigned to all elements in that subarray.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement the following steps:
1. Identify the MEX of each subarray.
2. Use the operations to fill the subarrays with their respective MEX values.
3. Ensure the sum of the array is maximized using the allowed operations.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    i = 0
    while i in seen:
        i += 1
    return i

def maximize_sum(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            current_mex = mex(a[i:j+1])
            if current_mex > a[i]:
                for k in range(i, j+1):
                    a[k] = current_mex
                    ops.append((i+1, j+1))
    
    return sum(a), len(ops), ops

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = maximize_sum(a)
    print(s, m)
    for l, r in ops:
        print(l, r)

func_3()
```

This approach ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated for each subarray and the array is filled with the appropriate values to maximize the sum.
