Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is a list that contains the count of '1's from each input string `b` that contained '1'.
- If an input string `b` did not contain '1', it is not included in the list `k`.
- The first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.

The print statement is simply `print('TRIANGLE')`.

Since the print statement does not reference any variables from the list `k`, it will print the string `'TRIANGLE'` directly.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
