Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `l` is an empty list, `x` is not defined since the loop has completed, `i` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in the original list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l` for each iteration, `c` is a list containing the count of 1s encountered so far for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then `s - (b - a + 1)` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s - (b - a + 1)` is set to be less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `a` and `b` are updated to integers from the input. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition also holds as is.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no change is made. Otherwise, no change is made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
