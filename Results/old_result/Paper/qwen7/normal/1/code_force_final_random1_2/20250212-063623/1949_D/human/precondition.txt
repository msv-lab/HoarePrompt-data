n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where the j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. The characters can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no video). At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are F or S.
