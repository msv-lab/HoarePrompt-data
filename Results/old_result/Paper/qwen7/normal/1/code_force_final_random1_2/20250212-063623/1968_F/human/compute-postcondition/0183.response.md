Output State: **`data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2 * q + 2, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', and an empty string is appended to `results`; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `data`, `idx`, `results`, or `q`. The only new information introduced is the list `a` which is now fully initialized with zeros.
