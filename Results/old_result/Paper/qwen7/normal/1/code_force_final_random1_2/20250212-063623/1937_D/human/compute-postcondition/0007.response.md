Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; the character at index `i` of `s` is '>'; the length of `idx_A` is 0; `A` contains the value 0.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `A`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains `0`, `n` must still be greater than `0`, the character at index `i` of `s` is still `'>'`, the length of `idx_A` is still `0`, and `A` now contains the value `0`.
