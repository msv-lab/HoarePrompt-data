Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `n` is greater than 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. This overwrites the previous value of `d2[i]` which was defined as either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` otherwise. Since the condition to determine the previous value of `d2[i]` is not specified, the new value directly replaces the old one. The values of `i`, `n`, and the relationship between `d2[i]` and the other variables are updated accordingly.
