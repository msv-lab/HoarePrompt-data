Output State: `x` is 2, `n` is at least 6, `m` is at least 7, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 16.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` remains unchanged at 2 because it does not change within the loop. The conditions for `n` and `m` also remain as they were after the third iteration since they do not change inside the loop. The value of `y` increases by 1 each time the loop runs, so after 4 iterations (including the initial state), `y` becomes 5. The variable `cnt` starts at 12 and increases by 1 for each valid iteration of the loop, so after 4 iterations, `cnt` is 16.
