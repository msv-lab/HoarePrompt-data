Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `x[0]`, `y[0]`, `r[0]` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code assigns three integers entered by the user to `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` respectively. The index `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
