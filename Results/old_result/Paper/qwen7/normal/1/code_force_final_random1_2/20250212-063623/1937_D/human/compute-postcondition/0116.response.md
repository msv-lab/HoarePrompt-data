Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` must be less than `n`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- The character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>'
- `r` is decreased by 1 (though the value of `r` is not relevant to the print statement)
- `l` is 0

The print statement is `print(i + 1, end=' ')`.

Since `i` is less than `n` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` must be a non-negative integer. The specific value of `i` is not provided, but it is known that `i + 1` will be a positive integer.

Therefore, the print statement will output `i + 1` followed by a space.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is a non-negative integer less than n)**
