Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the value 2**

Explanation: The line `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `ind`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` is still the length of the list `a`, and `ind` now contains the value 2.
