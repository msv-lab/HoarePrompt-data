Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 3; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `sa` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, and 3; `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0.**

Explanation: The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sa`. Initially, `sa` contains the integers 1 and 2. After appending 3, `sa` now contains 1, 2, and 3. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `sb`) remain unchanged.
