Output State: **`count` is 2, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is `n`, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. All other variables (`count`, `countmins`, `g`, `m`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
