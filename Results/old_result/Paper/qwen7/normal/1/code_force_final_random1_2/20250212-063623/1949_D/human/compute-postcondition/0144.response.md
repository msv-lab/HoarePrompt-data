Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2; `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0.**

Explanation: The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sa`. Initially, `sa` contains the integer 1. After appending, `sa` now contains the integers 1 and 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
