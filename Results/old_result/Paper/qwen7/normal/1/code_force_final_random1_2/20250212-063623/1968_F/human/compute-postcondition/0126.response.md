Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is unchanged, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(data[idx])` takes the element at index `idx` from the list `data` and converts it to an integer, assigning the result to the variable `l`. The initial values of `data` and `idx` remain unchanged.
