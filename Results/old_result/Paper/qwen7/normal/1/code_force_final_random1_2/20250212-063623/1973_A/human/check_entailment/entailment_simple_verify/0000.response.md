### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and `cas_de_test` with predefined test cases.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with these inputs and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`.
   - It calculates the total points and checks if they are even. If not, it appends `-1` and continues.
   - It calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as half of the total points.
   - It checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. If either condition is true, it appends `-1` and continues.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If `egalites` is negative, it appends `-1`. Otherwise, it appends `egalites // 2`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - The logic seems to follow the problem constraints and conditions accurately.

4. **Manual Verification of Specific Cases:**
   - **Case (1, 1, 2):**
     - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\)
     - Total matches: \(4 / 2 = 2\)
     - Differences: \(p3 - p2 = 1\), \(p3 - p1 = 1\)
     - Wins/Losses: \(2 \times 1 = 2\)
     - Remaining points: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\)
     - Draws: \(2 / 2 = 1\)
     - The program should return 1, but it returns -1. This is indeed a mistake.

5. **Other Test Cases:**
   - **Case (0, 0, 0):**
     - Total points: \(0 + 0 + 0 = 0\)
     - Total matches: \(0 / 2 = 0\)
     - No draws, so the program correctly returns 0.
   - **Case (0, 1, 1):**
     - Total points: \(0 + 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - Total matches: \(2 / 2 = 1\)
     - One draw, so the program correctly returns 1.
   - **Case (0, 2, 3):**
     - Total points: \(0 + 2 + 3 = 5\) (odd, so the program correctly returns -1).
   - **Case (3, 3, 3):**
     - Total points: \(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\) (odd, so the program correctly returns -1).
   - **Case (3, 4, 5):**
     - Total points: \(3 + 4 + 5 = 12\)
     - Total matches: \(12 / 2 = 6\)
     - Differences: \(p3 - p2 = 1\), \(p3 - p1 = 2\)
     - Wins/Losses: \(2 \times 1 + 2 \times 2 = 6\)
     - Remaining points: \(12 - 6 = 6\)
     - Draws: \(6 / 2 = 3\)
     - The program correctly returns -1 because it exceeds the number of matches.
   - **Case (1, 1, 10):**
     - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 10 = 12\)
     - Total matches: \(12 / 2 = 6\)
     - Differences: \(p3 - p2 = 9\), \(p3 - p1 = 9\)
     - Wins/Losses: \(2 \times 9 = 18\) (exceeds matches, so the program correctly returns -1).
   - **Case (0, 0, 6):**
     - Total points: \(0 + 0 + 6 = 6\)
     - Total matches: \(6 / 2 = 3\)
     - Differences: \(p3 - p2 = 6\), \(p3 - p1 = 6\)
     - Wins/Losses: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) (exceeds matches, so the program correctly returns -1).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case (1, 1, 2) correctly, returning -1 instead of 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
