To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `ops` is a list of tuples.
   - The length of `path_ba` determines the number of tuples in `ops`:
     - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains six tuples: 
       - (c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (c, 4), (c, 5), and (c, 6).
     - If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains twelve tuples:
       - (`c1`, `i + 4`), (`c2`, `i + 4`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i`), and (`c2`, `i + 4`).

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The lambda function takes each tuple `(x, y)` and returns a formatted string `f'{x + 1} {y}'`.

3. **Determining the Value of `ops`:**
   - Since the length of `path_ba` is not specified, we need to consider both cases:
     - **Case 1: Odd Length of `path_ba`**
       - `ops` contains: (c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (c, 4), (c, 5), (c, 6).
       - After applying the lambda function, `ops` becomes:
         - (1, 0), (2, 1), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6).
     - **Case 2: Even Length of `path_ba`**
       - `ops` contains: (`c1`, `i + 4`), (`c2`, `i + 4`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i + 4`).
       - After applying the lambda function, `ops` becomes:
         - (1, i + 4), (2, i + 4), (1, i + 2), (2, i + 2), (1, i), (2, i), (1, i + 2), (2, i + 2), (1, i), (2, i), (1, i), (2, i + 4).

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we provide the output for both cases.

Output: **(1 0)\n(2 1)\n(4 3)\n(5 4)\n(6 5)\n(7 6)** if the length of `path_ba` is odd, or **(1 [i + 4])\n(2 [i + 4])\n(1 [i + 2])\n(2 [i + 2])\n(1 [i])\n(2 [i])\n(1 [i + 2])\n(2 [i + 2])\n(1 [i])\n(2 [i])\n(1 [i])\n(2 [i + 4])** if the length of `path_ba` is even.
