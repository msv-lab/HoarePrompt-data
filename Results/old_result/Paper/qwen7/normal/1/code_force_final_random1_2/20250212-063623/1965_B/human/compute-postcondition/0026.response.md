Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `lk`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < lk - 1`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` contains the elements `[2, 2]`.
   - `i` is the loop variable, and at the end of the previous iteration, it was incremented from its previous value.
   - `lk` is a constant or a variable that defines the upper limit of the loop.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `lk - 2` (assuming it just finished the last iteration).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `lk - 1`, but the condition `i < lk - 1` must still hold true.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `lk - 1` for the next iteration.
   - `lk` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `ans`.
   - `i` is set to `lk - 1`.
   - `lk` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` contains the elements [2, 2], `i` is `lk - 1`, `lk` must be greater than `lk - 1`**.
