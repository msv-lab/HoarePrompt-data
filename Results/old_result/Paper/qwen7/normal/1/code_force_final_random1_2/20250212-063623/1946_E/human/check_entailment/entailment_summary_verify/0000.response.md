### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**: The problem requires constructing permutations based on given prefix and suffix maximums and counting the number of such permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. It is not directly related to the problem of constructing permutations.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of a number `a` modulo \(1000000007\). The result of `func_1` is used as a coefficient in a multiplication operation, but there is no indication that this is part of a solution to the problem. Specifically, the problem does not involve finding modular inverses or using the results of `func_1` in any meaningful way to construct or count permutations.

4. **Lack of Relevant Code**: There is no code in the provided functions that attempts to construct permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The functions do not perform any operations that would help in solving the problem as described.

Given these observations, the provided code does not address the requirements of the problem and thus is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not solve the given problem and instead implements unrelated mathematical functions.
