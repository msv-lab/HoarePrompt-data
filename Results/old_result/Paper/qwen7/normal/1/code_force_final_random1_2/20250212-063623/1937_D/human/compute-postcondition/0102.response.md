Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` plus 1, `b` is equal to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from the current value of `b`. Given the initial conditions, the updated value of `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
