Output State: **`curr` is 0, the loop has executed `m` times, `i` is `m - 1`, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, for each element `b[i]` in the list `b`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `b[i]` in the list `b`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `curr = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `curr`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
