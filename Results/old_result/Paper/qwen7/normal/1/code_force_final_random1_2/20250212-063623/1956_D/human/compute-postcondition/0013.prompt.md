You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    #This is printed: s, m (where s and m are the results of func_2(a)’s first and second returns, respectively)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `ops` is an empty list.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute as long as `ops` is a non-empty list, and since `ops` remains a non-empty list even after three iterations, it implies that the condition for the loop to continue (i.e., `ops` being non-empty) persists. However, the problem does not provide any information indicating that `ops` will become empty during or after the loop's execution. Therefore, based on the given information and without any additional conditions that could make `ops` empty, we can conclude that `ops` remains a non-empty list after all iterations of the loop have finished. But since the question asks for the state after all iterations and the only change mentioned is in the loop's continuation condition, and no operation inside the loop changes `ops` to an empty list, the most logical conclusion is that `ops` remains non-empty. However, if we strictly follow the instruction to describe the final state based on the given information and assuming the loop eventually stops, the only state that fits the description provided is when `ops` becomes empty, which means the loop has completed its iterations and there are no further operations to perform. Thus, `ops` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses predefined variables n (an integer between 1 and 18) and a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^7). It returns a value based on the analysis of the list a.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
