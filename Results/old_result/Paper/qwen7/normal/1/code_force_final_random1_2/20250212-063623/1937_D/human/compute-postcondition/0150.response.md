Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is either '>' or not '>'. If the character is '>', `l` is increased by 1, `a` is updated to `A[l]` if `l < r`, and `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `l < r`, otherwise `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0` and `r` is not 0. If the character is not '>', `a` remains unchanged if `l` is 0, otherwise `a` is updated to `ord(a) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is non-negative. If `l` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
