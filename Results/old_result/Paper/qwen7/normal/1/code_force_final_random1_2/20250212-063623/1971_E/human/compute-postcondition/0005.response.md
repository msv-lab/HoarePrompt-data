Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `ad` is a list containing only one element which is 0**.

The code initializes the list `ad` with a single element, which is 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
