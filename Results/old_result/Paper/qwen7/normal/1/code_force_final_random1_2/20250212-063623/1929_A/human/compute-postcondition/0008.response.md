Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `ntest` and `itest` remain unchanged. Therefore, `ntest` is still an input integer, `itest` is still 1, and `n` is now the input integer obtained from the user.
