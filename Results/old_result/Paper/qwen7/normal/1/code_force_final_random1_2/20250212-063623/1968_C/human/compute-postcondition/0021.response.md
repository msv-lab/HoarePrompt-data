Output State: **`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[1, n-1]`, and `a[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**

This means that the value of `a[i]` has been updated to the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]` for each `i` in the specified range. The values of `n` and `i` remain as per the initial state, and the array `a` has been modified according to the given formula.
