Output State: **`curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, this condition remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `curr` is still greater than or equal to `k`, and `ans` has been incremented by 1.
