Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, `sm` is equal to `a * (10 ** 9 + 7) + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\).**

Explanation: The value of `sm` is updated by adding \((a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)\) to its current value. Given that `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), the new value of `sm` becomes \(a * (10 ** 9 + 7) + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)\). All other variables remain unchanged.
