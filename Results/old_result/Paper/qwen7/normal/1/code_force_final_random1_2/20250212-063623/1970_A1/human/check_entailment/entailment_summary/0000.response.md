Reasoning:
1. The problem requires implementing a balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
2. The solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` is used as a key function in sorting, comparing two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
4. `func_2` processes the input string, calculates the balance at each position, sorts the `BalanceInfo` objects, and constructs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.

Let's verify the correctness of the implementation step-by-step:

1. **func_1**:
   - The function correctly compares `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   - If the balances are different, it returns the difference between the balances.
   - If the balances are the same, it returns the difference between the positions, ensuring that positions are considered in descending order when balances are equal.

2. **func_2**:
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates through the input string `s`, updating the balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
   - After processing the entire string, it sorts `balance_info` using `func_1` as the key function.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the implementation appears to correctly perform the balanced shuffle operation. The steps in `func_2` align with the problem requirements, and the sorting mechanism ensures that the resulting sequence meets the criteria of the balanced shuffle.

Correctness: **True**
