Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, so the difference between `n` (total moves) and `m` (final number of cubes) must be even. However, the program does not check this condition properly.

For example, consider the test case `n = 4` and `m = 3`. Here, `n` is even and `m` is odd. The difference between `n` and `m` is 1, which is odd. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. The program incorrectly prints "Yes" in this case because it does not check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
