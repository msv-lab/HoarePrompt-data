Output State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` is the value it was before minus 2, `pos_final` is an integer input from the user minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to integer, `best` is 10000000000.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `best` to the value \(10^{12}\), which is represented as 10000000000 in Python. This assignment does not affect the values of `total`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, or `custo_pra_passar_b`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
