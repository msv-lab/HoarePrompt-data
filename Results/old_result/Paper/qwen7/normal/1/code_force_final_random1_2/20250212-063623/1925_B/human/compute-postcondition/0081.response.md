Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and there exists an integer `i` such that \(1 \leq i \leq x\) and `x % i == 0`. After the execution of the if-else block, `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i` if the condition `(x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0)` is true. If the condition is false, `ans` remains unchanged.
