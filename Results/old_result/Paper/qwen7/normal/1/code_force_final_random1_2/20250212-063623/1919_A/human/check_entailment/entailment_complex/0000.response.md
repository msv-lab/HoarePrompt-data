Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they each have, given optimal play.
- The solution provided consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` determines the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, `func_1` returns 'Bob', otherwise it returns 'Alice'.
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the result. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins.
- The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes the test cases and prints the results as expected.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the functions work together to correctly determine the winner for each test case based on the sum of the coins being even or odd.

Correctness: **True**
