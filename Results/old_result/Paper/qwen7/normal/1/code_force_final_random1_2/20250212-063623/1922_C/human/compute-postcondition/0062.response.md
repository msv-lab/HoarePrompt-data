Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `m` is greater than 2 but no specific value is provided.
- `x` and `y` are input integers, but their specific values are not given.
- `x` and `y` are converted from input strings to integers.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

Here, `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its contents. However, we know that `d1` must be a dictionary because it is being indexed with keys `x` and `y`.

Given the information, the output will depend on the values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`. Since these values are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of the dictionary `d1`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]** (where `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are values from the dictionary `d1` corresponding to keys `x` and `y` respectively)
