Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` is `-1`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[-1]` (or `n` if `ar` is empty), and `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the index `i` will be `-1` (indicating the loop has processed all elements in the list `ar` from the last to the first). The variable `mex` will be adjusted based on the minimum difference between `n` and any element in `ar` found during the loop's execution. The list `res` will contain values that reflect the maximum exclusive element (`mex`) minus each corresponding element in `ar`, ensuring that no value in `res` is less than or equal to zero.
