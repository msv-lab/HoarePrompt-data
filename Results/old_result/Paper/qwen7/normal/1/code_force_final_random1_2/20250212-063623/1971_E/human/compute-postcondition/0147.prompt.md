Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `v` will contain the values `[ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[5] / bd[5], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `i` is `len(a)`, `len(b)` must be at least 1, and `a` remains unaffected.

This means that `v` will include the division of each pair of consecutive elements in `ad` starting from `ad[1]` up to `ad[len(a)-1]` (since `bd` is considered up to the same index as `a`). The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The length of `b` must still be at least 1, and the list `a` will not be modified by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, we continue the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `i` is 2, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using bisect_left, `l` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is `m` (which was `0 + b[s - 1]`) plus `(bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using `bisect_left`, `l` is 3, `ql` is an input integer - `a[s - 1]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
