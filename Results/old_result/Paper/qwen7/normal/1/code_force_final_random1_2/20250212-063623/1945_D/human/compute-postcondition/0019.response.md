Output State: **`na_frente` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ na_frente ≤ 10^4, `v` is a value such that v is less than or equal to pos_final, `best` remains unchanged if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `na_frente` and `v` retain their original properties, `best` remains unchanged unless `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `total` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
