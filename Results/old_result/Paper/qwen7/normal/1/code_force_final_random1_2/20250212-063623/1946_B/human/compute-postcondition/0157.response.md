Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, `smin` is a list where the last element is `smin[3]` appended with `smin[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `smin[i]` (which is `smin[3]` since `i` is 3) to the list `smin`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the last element of `smin` is now `smin[3]` repeated.
