Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'.

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains 1, `n` remains a positive integer, `j` remains 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remains '?'. The value of `nx` will be either 'F' or 'S' depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`.
