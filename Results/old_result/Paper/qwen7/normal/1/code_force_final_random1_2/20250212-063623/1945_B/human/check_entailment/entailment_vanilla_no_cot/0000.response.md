Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in its approach to calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `mn` and then the number of fireworks does not correctly account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched at different intervals.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks visible at any given time
        max_visible = (lcm_ab // a) + (lcm_ab // b) - 1
        
        print(max_visible)

from math import gcd

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` (`lcm_ab`) represents the smallest interval where both installations will launch fireworks simultaneously.
   
2. **Count Visible Fireworks:**
   - The number of fireworks visible at any given time is calculated using the formula `(lcm_ab // a) + (lcm_ab // b) - 1`.
   - We subtract 1 because the fireworks launched at the LCM interval are counted twice (once in `lcm_ab // a` and once in `lcm_ab // b`).

This approach ensures that the calculation accounts for the overlapping visibility periods correctly.
