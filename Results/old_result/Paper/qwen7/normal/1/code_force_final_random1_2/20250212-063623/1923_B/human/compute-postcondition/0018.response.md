Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads values for \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), list \( a \), and list \( x \). It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to determine if a certain condition is met. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends with the variable `t` set to 0, indicating that all inputs have been processed.**
