Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` contains the number `1` appended with the value of `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If `a[i]` is not equal to 0 or `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged. Since the `if` condition is met (`a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0`), `sb` now includes the value `3`.
