Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `bOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `newk` to be the integer division of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
