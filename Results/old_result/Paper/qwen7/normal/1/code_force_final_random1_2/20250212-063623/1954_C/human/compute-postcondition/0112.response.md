Output State: **`i` is `len(a)`, `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for the indices `j` where `a[j]` equals `b[j]`, and `None` otherwise, and the last element is `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, and `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`, and `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])`, and `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])**.

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged as `len(a)`. The list `new2` and its last element remain the same. The list `new` now has its `i`-th element updated to `min(a[i], b[i])`.
