Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `i` is `n-3`; `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. Since `i` is `n-3`, `opNum` is set to the value of `a[n-3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
