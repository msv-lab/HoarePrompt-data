Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The input for `i` is taken from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range of `int(input())`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is a list containing the characters from `alp` list at the indices calculated by counting occurrences of each element in `rev_array` starting from its current position and subtracting 1.
   - `rev_array` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is equal to `l`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `int(input())`, we need to update `i` to `i + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `int(input())` should remain the same as it is the upper limit for the range.

5. **Update the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `ans`, `rev_array`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is a list containing the characters from `alp` list at the indices calculated by counting occurrences of each element in `rev_array` starting from its current position and subtracting 1, `rev_array` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is equal to `l`**.
