Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `distance` is 0, `n` is the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of the monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from `range(n)` sorted by the absolute value of the corresponding elements in `x`, `pos` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while pos != len(sorted_indices):
    if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
        return False
    rest = k
    while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
        delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
        rest -= delta
        a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
        if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
            pos += 1
    distance += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop continues until `rest` becomes 0 or `pos` equals `len(sorted_indices)`. After all iterations, `rest` will be 0, and `pos` will be equal to `len(sorted_indices)`. The value of `delta` will be the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` at each iteration where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is greater than 0. Once `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced to 0, `pos` will increment, and the process repeats until `rest` is depleted or all indices in `sorted_indices` are processed; `distance` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `rest` is reduced to 0, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, all elements in the `a` array that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0, and `distance` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `distance` is increased by 1, all elements in the `a` array that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0, `rest` is equal to 0, and `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)` or the index where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is greater than 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
