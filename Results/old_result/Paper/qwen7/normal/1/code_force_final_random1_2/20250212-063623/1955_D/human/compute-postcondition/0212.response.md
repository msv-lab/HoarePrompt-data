Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in b_values`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: From the given information, we know that `i` is initially set to `n - m - 1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will iterate over each value in `b_values`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `b_values` is non-empty.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n - m - 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is within the bounds of `b_values`.
   - We don't need to adjust `n - m` since it is used to initialize `i` but is not part of the loop head.
   - We don't need to adjust `cnt_b`, `a`, `curr`, or `ans` because these are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be an element of `b_values`.

**State:**
- `i` must be an element of `b_values`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` must be an element of `b_values`**.
