Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `balance` is either 1, 0, or -1, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false, and `balance_info` now includes an additional instance of `BalanceInfo` with the updated balance, current index `i`, and the character `s[i]`.**

This means that the `balance_info` list now has one more instance of `BalanceInfo` added to it, which captures the current state of `balance`, the current value of `i`, and the character `s[i]` based on the condition `s[i] == '('`. The values of `i`, `balance`, `n`, and `balance_info` are updated accordingly, while `s` remains unchanged.
