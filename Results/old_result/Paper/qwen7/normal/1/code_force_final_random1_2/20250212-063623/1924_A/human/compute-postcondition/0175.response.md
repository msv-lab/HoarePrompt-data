Output State: **All characters of the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \(2^k - 1\), and `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times, `tmp` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = ''` initializes an empty string for `tmp`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
