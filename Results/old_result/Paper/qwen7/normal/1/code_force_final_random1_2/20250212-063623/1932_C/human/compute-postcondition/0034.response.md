Output State: **`b` is a list of length `n`, `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`, `p` is `p * v % m`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `p` and the second element is also `p`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element which is `p`. After appending `p`, `ans` now contains two elements, both of which are `p`. The other variables (`b`, `v`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
