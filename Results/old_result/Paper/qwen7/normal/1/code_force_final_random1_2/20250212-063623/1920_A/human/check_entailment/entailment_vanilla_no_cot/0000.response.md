Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Constraints**: The function `func_7` attempts to handle the constraints but does not correctly manage the overlap between different types of constraints. Specifically, it does not properly account for the "not equal" constraints (type 3).

2. **Logic Flaw**: The code assumes that `start` and `end` will always be within the valid range, but it does not handle cases where `start` might be greater than `end`. This is addressed in the code, but the handling of "not equal" constraints is flawed.

3. **Redundant Functions**: Most of the functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) are not used in the final solution and are likely remnants from an earlier development stage. They do not contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Improper Constraint Handling for Type 3**: The function `func_7` checks if a "not equal" constraint (type 3) falls within the range `[start, end]`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not properly exclude the values that should not be included. Instead, it should directly exclude these values from the count.

### Correct Solution:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        constraints = []
        for _ in range(n):
            t, x = map(int, input().split())
            constraints.append((t, x))
        
        # Initialize start and end
        start = float('inf')
        end = float('-inf')
        excluded_values = set()
        
        for t, x in constraints:
            if t == 1:
                start = min(start, x)
            elif t == 2:
                end = max(end, x)
            elif t == 3:
                excluded_values.add(x)
        
        # Calculate the valid range
        if start > end:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        valid_range = end - start + 1
        for val in excluded_values:
            if start <= val <= end:
                valid_range -= 1
        
        print(valid_range)

# Call the solve function
solve()
```

This solution correctly handles all types of constraints and ensures that the valid range is calculated accurately.
