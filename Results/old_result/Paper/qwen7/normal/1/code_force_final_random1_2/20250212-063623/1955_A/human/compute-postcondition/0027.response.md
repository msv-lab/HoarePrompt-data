Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the input value from the range function.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `A` is the first integer input
   - `B` is the second integer input
   - `C` is the third integer input
   - If `B * 2 < C`, then no change occurs. If `B * 2 >= C`, and `A` is even, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each integer input provided by the user. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration. The loop continues as long as the input is within the range specified by `t`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `i = 2`.
   - The input for the next iteration will be the next integer provided by the user.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be updated to `2`.
   - The input for the next iteration will be the next integer provided by the user, which we denote as `next_input`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer input, `B` is the second integer input, `C` is the third integer input, and `next_input` is the next integer input provided by the user.**

However, since the exact value of `next_input` is not known until the next iteration, we can only state that it will be the next integer input. Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer input, `B` is the second integer input, `C` is the third integer input, and `next_input` is the next integer input provided by the user.**
