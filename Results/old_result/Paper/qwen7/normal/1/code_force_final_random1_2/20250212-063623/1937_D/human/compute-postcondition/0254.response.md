Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of '<' and '>' characters. It calculates and prints a sequence of values based on the positions of '<' and '>' in the string. Specifically, it first processes the string from left to right to compute and store values in `A` and `idx_A`, and then processes the string from right to left to compute and store values in `B` and `idx_B`. Finally, it iterates through the string again, using the computed values in `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` to determine and print a series of integers. These integers are derived from the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string, and their calculations involve arithmetic operations based on the indices and lengths of these characters.**
