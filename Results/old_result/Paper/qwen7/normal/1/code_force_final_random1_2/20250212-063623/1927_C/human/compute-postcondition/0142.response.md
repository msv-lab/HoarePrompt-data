Output State: **`aOnes` is the count of how many times an element from list `a` was found in the loop up to `newk`, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. It also sets `bOnes` to 0 and updates `newk` to `k // 2`. The values of `aOnes`, `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
