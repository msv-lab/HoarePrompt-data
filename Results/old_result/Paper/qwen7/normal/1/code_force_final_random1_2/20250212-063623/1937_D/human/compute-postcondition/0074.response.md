Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is 4, `l` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and `idx_B` contains all the indices `i` where `s[i] == '<', `r` is the length of list `B`**.

The code `r = len(B)` assigns the length of list `B` to variable `r`. Since `B` is a list of integers, `r` will be an integer representing the number of elements in `B`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
