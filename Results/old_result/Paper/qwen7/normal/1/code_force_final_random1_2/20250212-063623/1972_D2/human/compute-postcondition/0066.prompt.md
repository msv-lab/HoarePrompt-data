You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the square root of n does not exceed 2 * 10^3.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 5, `n` is at least 55, `m` is at least 7, `y` is greater than 10, and `cnt` is 36.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the loop and the given information:
    #
    #1. The loop starts with `x` set to 1 and increments `x` by 1 each iteration as long as `x * x <= n`.
    #2. For each value of `x`, it initializes `y` to 1 and increments `y` as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true.
    #3. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, it updates `cnt` by adding the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`.
    #
    #From the provided output states after the first three iterations:
    #- After the first iteration (`x=2`), `cnt` is 12.
    #- After the second iteration (`x=3`), `cnt` is 15.
    #- After the third iteration (`x=4`), `cnt` is 24.
    #
    #We can infer that:
    #- Each increment of `x` adds to `cnt` based on the conditions of the inner while loop.
    #- The value of `cnt` increases by 3 for each additional iteration of the outer loop.
    #
    #Following this pattern:
    #- After the fourth iteration (`x=5`), `cnt` would be `24 + 3 = 27`.
    #- After the fifth iteration (`x=6`), `cnt` would be `27 + 3 = 30`.
    #- After the sixth iteration (`x=7`), `cnt` would be `30 + 3 = 33`.
    #- After the seventh iteration (`x=8`), `cnt` would be `33 + 3 = 36`.
    #
    #Since the problem does not specify the exact stopping condition but implies the loop continues until `x * x > n`, we assume the loop completes its iterations up to `x=5` based on the given information, leading to `cnt` being 36.
    #
    #Additionally, the constraints on `n` and `m` increase with each iteration, ensuring they meet the necessary conditions for the loop to continue. Thus, `n` must be at least 55 (since \(5^2 = 25\)), and `m` remains at least 7, with `y` starting from a value greater than 10 due to the increasing `x` values.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 36
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
