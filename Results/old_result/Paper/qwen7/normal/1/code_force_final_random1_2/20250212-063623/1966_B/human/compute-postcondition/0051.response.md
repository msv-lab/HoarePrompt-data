Postcondition: **`gr` is a grid, `impossible` remains `False`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is 'NO'**.

This postcondition indicates that after executing the if-else block, the grid `gr` remains unchanged, `impossible` remains `False`, `i` is still `n - 2`, and the variable `ans` is set to 'NO'. This outcome is consistent whether the if condition is true or false, as there is no modification to the variables outside the if condition and the else part is not provided, implying no alternative actions.
