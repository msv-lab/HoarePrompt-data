Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `m-2`, `gr` is a 2D list where either the first row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the first row, or the last row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the last row, and `impossible` remains `False`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2` (inclusive). After all iterations, the value of `j` will be `m - 2`. The condition inside the loop checks whether the corresponding elements in the first and last rows of the 2D list `gr` are not equal to their next elements. If any such pair of elements does not satisfy the equality condition, `impossible` is set to `False`. Since the problem statement mentions that `impossible` remains `True` only if no such pair exists, and given that `impossible` is initially `True`, it will remain `False` as long as there is at least one pair of elements that do not satisfy the condition.
