Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'; `cur` and `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur_ss` is updated to the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur_ss` to be the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'. All other variables (`s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
