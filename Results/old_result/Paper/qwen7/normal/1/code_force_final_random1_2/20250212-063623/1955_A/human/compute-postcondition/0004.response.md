Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- The current value of `B` multiplied by 2 is less than `C`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `A` and `B` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
2. The condition `B * 2 < C` is satisfied, meaning `B` is an integer such that \(B < \frac{C}{2}\).

When the `print(A * B)` statement is executed, it will print the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers obtained from the input split by spaces)**
