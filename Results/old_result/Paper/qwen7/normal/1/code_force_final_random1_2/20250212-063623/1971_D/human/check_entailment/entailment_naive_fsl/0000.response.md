Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the binary string has multiple segments of '0's followed by '1's. For example, consider the input "010101". The program will count this as needing 3 pieces, but it can actually be rearranged into a sorted binary string with just 2 pieces: "010" and "101".

To fix this, the program needs to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and ensure that each segment of '0's and '1's is treated appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        last_char = s[0]
        for j in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[j] != last_char:
                if last_char == '0' and s[j] == '1':
                    count += 1
                last_char = s[j]
        print(count)
```

This version correctly counts the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
