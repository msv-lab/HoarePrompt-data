Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `b`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`
     2. `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`

3. **Output**:
   - If either of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Reasoning

#### Condition 1: `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`
- This condition checks if the first element of the array is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2.
- If this condition is true, it means that the first two elements cannot be reduced to zero using the given operations because the operations always reduce the elements in a way that maintains the parity (odd/even nature) and specific differences.

#### Condition 2: `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`
- This condition checks if the last element of the array is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.
- Similar to the first condition, if this is true, the last two elements cannot be reduced to zero using the given operations.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the conditions with some examples from the problem statement:

1. **Example 1**: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
   - `b[0] = 1` (odd), `b[1] = 3` (not equal to 1 + 2)
   - `b[-1] = 2`, `b[-2] = 5` (5 is not equal to 2 + 2)
   - Both conditions are false, so the output should be 'YES'.

2. **Example 2**: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
   - `b[0] = 2` (even), `b[1] = 4` (4 is equal to 2 + 2)
   - `b[-1] = 1`, `b[-2] = 5` (5 is not equal to 1 + 2)
   - Only the second condition is false, but since both conditions need to be checked, the output should be 'YES' (as only the second condition is relevant here).

3. **Example 3**: `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`
   - `b[0] = 0` (even), `b[1] = 1` (1 is not equal to 0 + 2)
   - `b[-1] = 1`, `b[-2] = 3` (3 is not equal to 1 + 2)
   - Both conditions are false, so the output should be 'YES'.

4. **Example 4**: `[5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]`
   - `b[0] = 5` (odd), `b[1] = 6` (6 is not equal to 5 + 2)
   - `b[-1] = 0`, `b[-2] = 3` (3 is not equal to 0 + 2)
   - Both conditions are false, so the output should be 'YES'.

5. **Example 5**: `[1, 2, 7, 2]`
   - `b[0] = 1` (odd), `b[1] = 2` (2 is not equal to 1 + 2)
   - `b[-1] = 2`, `b[-2] = 7` (7 is not equal to 2 + 2)
   - Both conditions are false, so the output should be 'YES'.

6. **Example 6**: `[7, 1, 0]`
   - `b[0] = 7` (odd), `b[1] = 1` (1 is not equal to 7 + 2)
   - `b[-1] = 0`, `b[-2] = 1` (1 is not equal to 0 + 2)
   - Both conditions are false, so the output should be 'YES'.

7. **Example 7**: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `b[0] = 1` (odd), `b[1] = 1` (1 is not equal to 1 + 2)
   - `b[-1] = 1`, `b[-2] = 1` (1 is not equal to 1 + 2)
   - Both conditions are false, so the output should be 'YES'.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to check if the first and last elements violate the conditions necessary for making all elements zero. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
