Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `1 <= i < n` must be satisfied. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `1 < n`. Since `n` must be at least 2, it remains unchanged or can be any value greater than 1 (but typically it would remain the same unless specified otherwise).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total`, `best`, `k`, and `res` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition alone. Therefore, they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `total` remains the same: `total` is still 1.
   - `i` increases by 1: `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains at least 2: `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `k` is `n-1`: Since `n` remains the same, `k` remains `n-1`.
   - `res` remains the same: `res` is still the string with the current value being '<'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`total` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is `n-1`, and `res` is the string with the current value being '<'**
