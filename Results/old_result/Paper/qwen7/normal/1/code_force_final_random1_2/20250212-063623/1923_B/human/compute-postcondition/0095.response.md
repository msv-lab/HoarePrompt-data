Output State: **`distance` is increased by 1, all elements in the `a` array that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0, `rest` is equal to 0, and `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)` or the index where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is greater than 0.**

This means that the `distance` variable has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`a`, `rest`, and `pos`) remain in their original state as described in the initial state.
