Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `suf` is updated such that `suf[i+1] = suf[i] + l[i]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 (assuming it started from 0 or some other value that would allow the loop to proceed).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` was incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The updated value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`suf` is updated such that `suf[i+1] = suf[i] + l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
