Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. The values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `d` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` contains the divisions of each pair of consecutive elements in `ad` starting from `ad[1]` up to `ad[len(a)-1]` with `bd`, `i` is `len(a)`, `l` is `len(a) - 1`, and `ql` is an input integer reduced by `a[s - 1]` for the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `v` is a list containing elements calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `len(a) - 1`, `l` is equal to `q`, `m` is the cumulative value of `b[s - 1]` plus the sum of `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the index where `ql - a[s - 1]` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and if `a[s]` is equal to `ql - a[s - 1]`, no changes are made. If `a[s]` is not equal to `ql - a[s - 1]`, no changes are made either since there is no else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
