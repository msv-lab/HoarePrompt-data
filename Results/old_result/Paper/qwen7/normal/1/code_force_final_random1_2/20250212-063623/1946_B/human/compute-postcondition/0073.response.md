Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sm`: Equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus \(10^9 + 7\) or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), depending on whether `sm` is less than 0.
   - `a`: Absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `j`: `t`.
   - `n`: First element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `k`: Second element of the list `b` converted to an integer.
   - `l`: List of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `suf`: List `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1]]`.
   - `suf[n]`: `l[0] + l[1]`.
   - `i`: 3.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the list `b` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `sm`, `a`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, and `n` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus \(10^9 + 7\) or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), depending on whether `sm` is less than 0; `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\); `j` is `t`; `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers; `suf` is now [0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`]; `suf[n]` is `l[0] + l[1]`; `i` is 4**.
