### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations that match given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - This involves combinatorial logic and segment-based counting, not just GCD and modular arithmetic.

2. **Provided Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the modular inverse. However, this function alone does not help in solving the permutation problem.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `a` modulo `1000000007`. Again, this function is not directly related to solving the permutation problem.

3. **Core Logic Needed**:
   - To solve the problem, one needs to identify segments between prefix and suffix maximums and count the number of valid permutations within these segments.
   - This typically involves dynamic programming or combinatorial counting techniques, not just modular arithmetic.

4. **Relevance of Provided Functions**:
   - The provided functions do not contribute to solving the core problem. They are likely meant for other purposes, such as handling modular arithmetic, but are not relevant here.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the problem as stated. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the combinatorial logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem of counting permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
