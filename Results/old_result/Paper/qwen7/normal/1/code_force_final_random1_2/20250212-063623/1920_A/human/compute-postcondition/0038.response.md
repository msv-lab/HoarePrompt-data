Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from input, `v` is the second integer from input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from input, and if `t` does not equal 2, `start` remains unchanged; if `t` equals 2, `end` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `v` is the second integer from input, `num` now contains this integer. The values of `i`, `t`, and the condition regarding `start` and `end` remain unchanged.
