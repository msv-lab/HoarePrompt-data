Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k - 0`, `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `delta` is equal to `0`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` decreases the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` by `delta`. Given that `delta` is equal to `0`, the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` remains unchanged. The other variables (`rest`, `pos`, and `delta`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
