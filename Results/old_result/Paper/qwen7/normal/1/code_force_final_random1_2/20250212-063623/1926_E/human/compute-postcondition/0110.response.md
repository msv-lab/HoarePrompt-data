Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for a in L:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `a` and `L`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `L`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is 1
   - `L` is [1, 3, 2]
   - `pow` is 2
   - `tot` is `tot` + 1 (This is not directly relevant to the loop head)

4. **Determine the next value of `a`**: Since `a` is currently set to the first element of `L` (which is 1), the next value of `a` will be the second element of `L`.

5. **Update the list `L`**: After processing the first element, the list `L` will be updated to exclude the first element. So, `L` will become `[3, 2]`.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update `a` to the next element in the list and ensure `L` is updated accordingly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is 3, `L` is [3, 2]**
