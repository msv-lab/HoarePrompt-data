You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character

def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between infoA's balance and infoB's balance, where both balances are integers.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where both `balance` attributes are equal, and `position` represents the position of a character in a parentheses sequence
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `balance` will be the final balance calculated after processing all characters in `s`, `n` will be the length of `s`, and `balance_info` will be a list containing an instance of `BalanceInfo` for each iteration of the loop. Each instance in `balance_info` will have its `balance` updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, the current value of `i`, and the character `s[i]`. The `balance` value will reflect the net count of unmatched opening parentheses '(' minus closing parentheses ')' after processing all characters in `s`.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is a string containing the characters from each BalanceInfo instance in the sorted balance_info list)




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Balanced Shuffle Operation**:
   - The balanced shuffle operation involves computing the balance of each prefix of the input string.
   - These balances and their corresponding positions are stored in a list.
   - The list is then sorted based on the balance (in ascending order) and position (in descending order for ties).
   - The final sequence formed by the characters at the sorted positions is the balanced shuffle.

2. **Key Components of the Program**:
   - `func_1`: This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects. It should return the difference in balance, and if the balance is equal, it returns the difference in position.
   - `func_2`: This function performs the main logic of the balanced shuffle operation.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function initializes the length of the input string `s` and creates an empty list `balance_info`.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, updating the balance and storing `BalanceInfo` objects in the list.
   - After collecting all `BalanceInfo` objects, it sorts them using the key specified (`(x.balance, -x.position)`).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.

4. **Checking the Implementation**:
   - The sorting key `(x.balance, -x.position)` ensures that the list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties.
   - The construction of the result string by joining the characters from the sorted list is correct.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It computes the balance of each prefix, stores the necessary information, sorts the information based on the required criteria, and constructs the final balanced shuffle sequence.
