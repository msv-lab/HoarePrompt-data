Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations. For each of the `m` queries, the correct difference based on the values of `d1` and `d2` has been printed. The values of `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged from their final state after the last iteration. The variable `m` remains as the last input value provided, and `j` is equal to `m-1`. The variables `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers inputted by the user during the loop's final iteration, and they have been used to compute the final output.
