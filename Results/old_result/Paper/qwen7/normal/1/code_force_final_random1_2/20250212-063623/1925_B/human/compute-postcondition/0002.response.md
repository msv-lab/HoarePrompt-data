Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is the first integer input split from the input, `n` is the second integer input split from the input, `ans` is 1**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. The values of `t`, `q`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the initial values of the other variables.
