Output State: **`ans` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input().split(), `x` is an input integer, `ii` is `tt`, `n` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`ans`, `x`, `ii`, `n`, `y`) remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to its sorted version.
