Output State: `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `numbers` is an empty list, `distribute_number(num)` has been called with an argument `num` three times.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `numbers` will be an empty list because each number from the original list was processed exactly once. The functions `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` remain at 0 as there were no operations modifying these variables within the loop. The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called three times, once for each iteration of the loop.
