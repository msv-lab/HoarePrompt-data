Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an integer obtained from splitting the input and converting it to an integer

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the context of `d2`. Since `d2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact form. However, we know that `d2` is likely a dictionary or a list where the keys or indices correspond to some values, and `x` and `y` are used to access these values.

Since `x` and `y` are derived from the input, let's assume they are valid indices or keys in `d2`. The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` will subtract the value at index/key `x` from the value at index/key `y`.

Given the lack of specific values for `d2`, `x`, and `y`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
