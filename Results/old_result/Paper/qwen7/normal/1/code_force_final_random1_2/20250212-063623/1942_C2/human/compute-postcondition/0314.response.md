Postcondition: `even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least two elements, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` will be the next element from `odd`, `ans` is increased by the previous `gap` value, and `y` is decreased by the previous `gap // 2` value, if `y` is not less than `gap // 2`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `ans` is increased by 0 and `y` is decreased by 0.
