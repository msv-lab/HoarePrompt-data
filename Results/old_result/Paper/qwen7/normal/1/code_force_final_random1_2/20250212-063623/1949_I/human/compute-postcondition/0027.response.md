Output State: **`coef[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `tot` is 0, `n`, `bipartite`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `tot`, and `ok` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `tot` is assigned the value 0. All other variables (`coef[2]`, `i`, `n`, `bipartite`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `tot`, and `ok`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
