Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the object `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `lst` is currently empty.
   - `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in the original `lst`.
   - `final` is an empty list.

3. **Analyze the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
   - For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element because the loop will fail if `lst` is empty.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `lst` is currently empty, we need to ensure that `lst` has at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `mini` and `final` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute; they are initialized based on the elements in `lst`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `lst` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, mini holds the minimum value among abs(pk - ele) for all ele in the original lst, final is an empty list**
