Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `False`, and `j` equals `m - 1`. This is because if `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds true, `impossible` is set to `False`; otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
