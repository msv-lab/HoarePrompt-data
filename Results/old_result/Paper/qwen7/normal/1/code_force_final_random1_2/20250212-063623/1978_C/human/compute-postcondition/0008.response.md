Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns either the new values of `n` and `k` after calling `func_4()`, or the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))` based on the given constraints.**

This means the function does not take any input parameters but instead relies on the values of `n` and `k` which are constrained as follows: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). Depending on the implementation of `func_4()` and `func_5()` and `func_1()`, the function will either return the updated values of `n` and `k` after calling `func_4()`, or it will return the result of calling `func_5()` with the output of `func_1(n, k)` as its argument.
