Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

The code `a = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is a positive integer) to the variable `a`. The other variables (`s`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
