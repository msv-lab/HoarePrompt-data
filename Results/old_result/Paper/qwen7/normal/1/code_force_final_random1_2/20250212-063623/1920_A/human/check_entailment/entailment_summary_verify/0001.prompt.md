You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function processes a series of constraints and a list of integers. It identifies the minimum value (`start`) from constraints of type 1 and the maximum value (`end`) from constraints of type 2. It then counts how many integers in the provided list (`num`) fall within the range `[start, end]`. If the range is invalid (i.e., `start` is greater than `end`), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the difference between the range size (`end - start + 1`) and the count of integers within the range, returning 0 if this difference is non-positive.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine how many integers \( k \) satisfy a set of constraints. These constraints include:
   - \( k \geq x \) (type 1)
   - \( k \leq x \) (type 2)
   - \( k \neq x \) (type 3)

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`) but does not use them effectively for solving the problem.
   - The main function `func_7` is designed to solve the problem. Let's break down its logic:
     - It reads the number of constraints \( n \).
     - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0.
     - For each constraint, it updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint.
     - It collects all values from type 3 constraints into the `num` list.
     - It calculates the potential range of valid \( k \) values as `end - start + 1`.
     - It subtracts the number of invalid \( k \) values (those in `num`) from the potential range.
     - If `start` exceeds `end`, it returns 0 (indicating no valid \( k \)).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and calculates the valid range of \( k \).
   - The handling of type 3 constraints (values that \( k \) cannot be) is appropriately subtracted from the total range.
   - The edge case where `start` exceeds `end` is handled correctly by returning 0.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described in the problem statement.
