Output State: **`tot` is now `tot + a`, `k` is unchanged, `a` is the next integer in the list `L`, `pow` is multiplied by 2.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. The other variables (`tot`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `tot` remains as `tot + a`, `k` stays unchanged, `a` is still the next integer in the list `L`, and `pow` is now twice its original value.
