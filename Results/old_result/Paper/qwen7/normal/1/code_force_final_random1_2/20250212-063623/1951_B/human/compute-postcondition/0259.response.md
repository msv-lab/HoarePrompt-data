Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it swaps the first element of the list with the element at index `k-1`, calculates two counts (`ans` and `ans1`) based on specific conditions involving the first element of the list, and then prints the maximum of these two counts. The final output reflects the highest possible count of elements in the list that meet the specified conditions across all test cases.
