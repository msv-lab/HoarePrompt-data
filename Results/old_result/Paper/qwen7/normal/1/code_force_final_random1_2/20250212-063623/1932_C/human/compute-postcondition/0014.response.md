Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with two elements, where the second element is the same as the first element.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. Initially, `b` is a list with one element, which is `a[l]`. After executing `l += 1`, `l` now points to the next index in the list, meaning `b` now contains two elements, with the second element being the same as the first element since no new value was appended. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
