Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. All other variables (`s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
