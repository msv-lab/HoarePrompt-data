Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculation of `mn`**: The variable `mn` is correctly defined as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. This is used to calculate the time interval within which the maximum number of fireworks can be visible.

3. **Divisibility Check**: The program checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and ensures that neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If these conditions are met, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

4. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - When `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, the formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` is correct because it accounts for the overlap of the intervals perfectly.
   - When `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`, the formula `mn // a + mn // b` is correct because it counts the non-overlapping intervals accurately.

5. **Loop and Output**: The loop correctly processes all test cases, and the output is generated as per the problem statement.

Given that the program follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
