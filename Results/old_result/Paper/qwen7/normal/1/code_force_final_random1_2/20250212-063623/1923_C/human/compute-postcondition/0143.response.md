Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `j` will be the count of 1's in the list `l`, `p` will be a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of `l`, and `c` will be a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1's in `l`.**

In more detail:
- `i` accumulates the sum of all elements in `l` as each element is processed.
- `j` increments every time `x` is 1, so `j` will be the total number of 1's in `l`.
- `p` is constructed by appending the cumulative sum of `l` to it, starting with 0.
- `c` is constructed by appending the cumulative count of 1's in `l` to it, starting with 0.
