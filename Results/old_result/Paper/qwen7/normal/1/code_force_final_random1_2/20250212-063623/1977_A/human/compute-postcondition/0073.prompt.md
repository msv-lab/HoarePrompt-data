You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `t` remains the same as its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, since the loop runs `t` times. The variables `n` and `m` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` is the first integer input by the user, and `m` is the second integer input by the user during the last iteration. The output of the loop depends on the values of `n` and `m` during the last iteration:
    #
    #- If `n` equals `m`, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- If `m` is greater than `n`, the output is 'No'.
    #- If `m` equals `n - 1`, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- If both `m` and `n` are even, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- If both `m` and `n` are odd, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- Otherwise, the output is 'No'.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, and the final output of the loop is determined by the values of `n` and `m` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes values for t, n, and m where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers between 1 and 100. The function returns different outputs based on the values of n and m for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
