Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `t` will be the last integer from input, `v` will be the second last integer from input, `num` will be a list containing all integers from input where `t` was 3, and `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1, or it will remain unchanged if no such `v` exists; `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2, or it will remain unchanged if no such `v` exists; `count_num` is 0.**

The code `count_num = 0` initializes the variable `count_num` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `i`, `t`, `v`, `num`, `start`, or `end`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were after the loop executed.
