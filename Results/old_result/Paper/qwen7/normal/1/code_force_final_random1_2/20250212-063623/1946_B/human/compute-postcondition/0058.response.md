Output State: **`sm` is equal to (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo (10 ** 9 + 7), and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by taking its value modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Given that `sm` was initially equal to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) and was guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `sm` is now \((2 + \text{suf}[n]) \mod (10^9 + 7)\). This ensures that `sm` remains non-negative and fits within the range required by the modulo operation.
