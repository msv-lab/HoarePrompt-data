The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains 'YES'**
