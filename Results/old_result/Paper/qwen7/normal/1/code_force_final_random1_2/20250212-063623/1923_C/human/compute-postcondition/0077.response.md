Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next integer in the list, `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. The values of `l`, `x`, `j`, and `i` are updated according to their respective rules, but `p` is initialized with the new value of `i`.
