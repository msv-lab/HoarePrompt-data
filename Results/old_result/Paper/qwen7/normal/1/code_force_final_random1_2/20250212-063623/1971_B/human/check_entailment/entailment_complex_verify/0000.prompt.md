You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` being a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` being the total number of iterations the loop was set to run, `i` being equal to `n - 1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`), `s` being the last input string provided, `a` being a set containing the unique characters from `s`, and `b` and `c` being strings representing the sorted and reverse-sorted versions of `s`, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` followed by `t` strings `s`. For each string `s`, it checks if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then either the lexicographically smallest or the largest permutation of `s`, depending on which is equal to `s`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value but ensures that for each input string, the appropriate output is printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a new string `r` that is different from the input string `s`. Instead, it checks if the string has exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints "NO", indicating that no such string `r` exists. However, according to the problem description, if `s` consists of more than two unique characters, it should be possible to rearrange the characters to form a new string `r` that is different from `s`.

For example, consider the input string "co". The program would output "NO" because it only checks for strings with exactly two unique characters. However, "co" has more than two unique characters, and we can rearrange it to form a new string like "oc", which is different from "co".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
