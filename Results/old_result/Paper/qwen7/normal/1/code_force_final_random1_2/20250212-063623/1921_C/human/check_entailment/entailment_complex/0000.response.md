Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs.
2. It calculates the differences between consecutive message sending moments and checks if these differences are less than the ratio \( \frac{b}{a} \).
3. If the difference is less, it adds the product of the difference and \( a \) to a list `array2`.
4. It then compares the sum of the elements in `array2` with the adjusted value of `f` (which is `f` minus the number of elements in `array2` times `b`).
5. The logic to determine whether Stepan can send all messages is sound. Specifically, it correctly accounts for the energy cost of turning the phone off and on, and the energy cost of keeping the phone on between messages.
6. The program correctly prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
