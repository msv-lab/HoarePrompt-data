Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'; if `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is set to 0, and `ans` is updated to `ss + ans`; otherwise, the values of `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
