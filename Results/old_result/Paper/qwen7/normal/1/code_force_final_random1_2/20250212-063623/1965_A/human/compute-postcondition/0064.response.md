Postcondition: `j` is 1, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and the difference between the first two elements of `lis` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1. If `j` is odd, the postcondition remains as initially described. If `j` is even, the postcondition changes to the description provided in the else part.
