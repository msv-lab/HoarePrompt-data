Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values or conditions needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Check the given state before the loop**:
   - `idx` is equal to `2 * n + 7`.
   - `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1.
   - `results` contains 'NO'.
   - `n` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`.
   - `q` is the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`.
   - `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.
   - `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`.
   - `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.
   - `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`.
   - `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.
   - `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
   - `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
   - `mp` is updated to {(0): [0]}.
   - `t` is decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The loop will start when `i` is 1 and increment up to `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be initialized to 1 and `n` should be a positive integer (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
