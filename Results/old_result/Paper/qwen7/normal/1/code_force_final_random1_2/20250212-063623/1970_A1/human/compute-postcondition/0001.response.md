Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `balance_info = []` creates an empty list named `balance_info`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the length of `s` (`n`) and the fact that `s` consists only of characters "(" and ")" remain unchanged.
