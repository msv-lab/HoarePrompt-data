To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

Given the current state:
- `x` is 3
- `n` is at least 12
- `m` is at least 7
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is 16

We need to check the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

Substituting the values:
1. `(3 + 2) * 3 <= n` simplifies to `15 <= n`
2. `(3 + 2) * 2 <= m` simplifies to `10 <= m`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
- `15 <= n`
- `10 <= m`

Since `n` is at least 12 and `m` is at least 7, the current values satisfy the second condition but not the first. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to ensure `15 <= n`.

No adjustments are needed for `x`, `y`, or `m` since they already satisfy their respective conditions.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`x` is 3, `n` must be at least 15, `m` is at least 7, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 16**
