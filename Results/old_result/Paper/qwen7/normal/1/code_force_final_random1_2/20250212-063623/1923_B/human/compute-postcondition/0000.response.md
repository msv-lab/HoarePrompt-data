Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid, but now `t` specifically holds the value entered by the user. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
