Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-5`, `j` is 4, `x` is undefined, `B` is a list with one element which is `x`.**

Explanation: The code `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Since `x` is undefined, it remains undefined. The values of `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about `B`.
