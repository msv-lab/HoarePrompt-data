Output State: `power` is 5, `n` must be greater than 256, and `n_cases` must be greater than 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`. From the given information, we can see that after each iteration, `power` increases by 1. After 3 iterations, `power` is 4 and `n` must be greater than 8. This implies that `n` must be at least 9 (since `n` is \(\log_2(n)\), and \(2^3 = 8\), so `n` must be greater than 8). 

For the fourth iteration, `power` will become 5. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than \(2^5 = 32\). However, since the condition after 3 iterations already states that `n` must be greater than 8, and it needs to hold true for all subsequent iterations, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 256 (since \(2^8 = 256\)) for the loop to execute fully. Therefore, after all iterations, `power` will be 5 and `n` must be greater than 256.
