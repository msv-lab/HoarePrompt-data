Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while power < n:`. The variables involved here are `power` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `power` is currently 1.
   - `n` is currently `log2(n)`, which means `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute the first time**: The loop will execute if `power < n` is true. Given that `power` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Check the given constraints**:
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 2. This is not directly related to the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.
   - `i` is currently 3. This is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `power` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time. However, since `n` is defined as `log2(n)`, this implies that the original value of `n` must have been at least 2 (because `log2(2) = 1`).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 1, which aligns with the condition derived from the loop head.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
