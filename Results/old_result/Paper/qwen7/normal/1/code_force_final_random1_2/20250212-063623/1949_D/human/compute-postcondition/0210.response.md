Output State: **`i` is 2; `nx` is 'FS'; `n` must be at least 1; `j` is `n + 1`; and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?' in the if part.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to its current value. Since `nx` was either 'F' or 'S', after appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'FS'. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
