Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if 4 * n - 2 == k:
        print(k // 2 + 1)
    else:
        print(ceil(k / 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `4 * n - 2 != k` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `n`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
