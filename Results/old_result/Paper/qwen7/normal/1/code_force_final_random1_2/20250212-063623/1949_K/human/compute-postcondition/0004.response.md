Output State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `numbers` is a non-empty list, `distribute_number(num)` has been called with an argument `num`.**

The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called with an argument `num`, but the content of this function is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`, or `numbers`. However, we know that `numbers` must be a non-empty list before calling the function, and the function call itself does not change the initial values of `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`.
