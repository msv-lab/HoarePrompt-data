Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 2; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    q = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = {(0): [0]}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        if pf[i] not in mp:
            mp[pf[i]] = []
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[idx])
        r = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
        v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
        it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    results.append('')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is equal to `n + 5 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` contains 'NO', `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer value from `data[4]` after decrementing by the number of iterations, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by `2 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', and an empty string is appended to `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is `2 * n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding value from the `data` list starting from `idx - n` to `idx - 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is computed as the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from the `pf` list and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `a` where that key appears, `results` is a list containing the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') of the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and `results` now contains an additional empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
