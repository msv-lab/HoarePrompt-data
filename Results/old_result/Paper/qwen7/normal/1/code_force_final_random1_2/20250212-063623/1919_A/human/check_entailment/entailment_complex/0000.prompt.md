Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
        #The program returns 'Bob'
    else :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It checks if their sum is even. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'; otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the `winner` values from each iteration, the original `a` and `b` values from each iteration, and the `winner` is added to the list after each iteration until `t` becomes 0.
    #
    #In this final state, `t` has reached 0 after all iterations of the loop have completed, meaning all `t` input integers have been processed. The `results` list contains the `winner` value determined by `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers `(a, b)` entered by the user, along with the original values of `a` and `b` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing tuples for each iteration where each tuple includes the `winner`, the original values of `a` and `b`, and possibly other information.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two positive integers (`a` and `b`) and calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner based on the inputs. It collects the results of these calls in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, which include the winner for each test case along with the original values of `a` and `b`.
