Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a quadruple of non-negative integers (p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to take in a quadruple of integers (p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) which represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in some initial sequence. The function will then process these counts according to certain rules and return a result, though the specific result is not detailed in the provided information.
