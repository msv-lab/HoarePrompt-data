Postcondition: `j` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 1. If the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the last row in `gr`, then `impossible` remains `False`. If neither of these conditions is met, the value of `impossible` remains unchanged.
