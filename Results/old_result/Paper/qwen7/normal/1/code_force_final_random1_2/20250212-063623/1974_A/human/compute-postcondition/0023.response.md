Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), `m` is \(15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `z` by adding \((x - m + 14) // 15\) to its current value. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `z` is expressed as \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\).
