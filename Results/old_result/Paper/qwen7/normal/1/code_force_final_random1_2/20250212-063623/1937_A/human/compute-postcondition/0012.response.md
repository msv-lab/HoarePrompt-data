Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `power` is 3
   - `n` is \(\log_2(n)\)
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be greater than 2

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop head contains the variables `power` and `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < n` must be true.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `power` is 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n` is \(\log_2(n)\), we need to ensure that \( \log_2(n) > 3 \).
   - Solving \( \log_2(n) > 3 \) gives us \( n > 2^3 = 8 \).

5. **Final state**:
   - `power` remains 3 (no change needed as it is already set).
   - `n` must be greater than 8.
   - `n_cases` must still be greater than 0 (no change needed as it is already set).

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`power` is 3, `n` must be greater than 8, and `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
