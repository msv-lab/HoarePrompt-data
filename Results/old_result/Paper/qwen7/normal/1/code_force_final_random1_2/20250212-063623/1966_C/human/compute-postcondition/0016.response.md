Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `tc > 0`.

2. **Determine the relevant variables**: The only variable in the loop head that affects the loop condition is `tc`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is greater than 0 minus 1 (which simplifies to `tc` is greater than -1, but since `tc` is an integer, this means `tc` is at least 0).
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0.
   - `dp` is the result of `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

4. **Condition for the loop to execute one more time**: For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `tc` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop condition, we need to ensure that `tc` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

Given the current state where `tc` is greater than -1, we need to ensure that `tc` is greater than 0 for the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `tc` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is the result of `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is equal to `n`**.
