Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length of at least 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, and `j` is 0, if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1'. Otherwise, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length of at least 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is False, and `j` is 0.
