Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.** 

Note: The function `func_4`, `func_1`, and `func_5` are not defined in the provided code snippet, so their exact behavior and the types of their parameters are not specified here. The precondition is based solely on the variables `n` and `k` passed to `func_6`.
