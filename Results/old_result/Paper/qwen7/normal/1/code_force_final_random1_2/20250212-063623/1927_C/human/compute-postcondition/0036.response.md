The variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Since `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged and are not part of the loop head, no adjustments are needed for these variables.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

State: **`aOnes` remains unchanged, `bOnes` remains 0, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`**
