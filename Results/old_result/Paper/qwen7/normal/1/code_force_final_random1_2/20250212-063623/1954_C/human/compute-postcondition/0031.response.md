Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `new2[i]`, `new2[i+1]`, `new[i+1]`, and `new[i]` remain unchanged from their previous states.
