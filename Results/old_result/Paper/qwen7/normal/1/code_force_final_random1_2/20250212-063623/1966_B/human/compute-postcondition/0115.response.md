Output State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the append operation, `i` is 1, `ans` is 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends a new input value to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains one element which is the original input. After appending a new input, `gr` now contains two elements: the original input and the new input. All other variables remain unchanged.
