Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS' or 'SF'
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `j` is `n + 1`
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to `n`.

5. **Adjust other relevant states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nx` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` needs to be checked if `j` is now `n` to ensure it is not '?'.

Given these considerations, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS' or 'SF', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
