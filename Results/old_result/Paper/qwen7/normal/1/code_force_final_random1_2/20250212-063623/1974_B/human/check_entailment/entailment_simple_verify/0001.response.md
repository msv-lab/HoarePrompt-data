### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to decode a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and then reads the string `b` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to perform the decoding.
   - In `func_1`, the code creates a list of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form `unique_chars`.
   - It then iterates through each character in `b`, finds its position in `unique_chars`, and replaces it with the symmetric character from `unique_chars`.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The function `func_1` indeed aims to create an auxiliary string `unique_chars` containing all distinct characters from the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order.
   - However, the logic to map each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars` is flawed. The code attempts to replace characters in `b` directly, which is incorrect because `replace` modifies the string in place and can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with multiple occurrences of the same character.
   - The code also incorrectly inserts characters into `unique_chars` instead of mapping them.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Create a dictionary that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart.
   - Iterate through `b` and use the dictionary to map each character to its decoded counterpart.

5. **Evaluation of the Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly identifies that the function `func_1` should map each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars`.
   - However, the implementation in `func_1` is still incorrect because it attempts to replace characters in `b` directly, which can lead to issues with multiple occurrences of the same character.
   - The annotated code suggests that after processing, `unique_chars` should contain the correct mapping, but the actual implementation in `func_1` does not achieve this correctly.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Despite the correct understanding of the problem and the intended approach, the current implementation in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly decode the string `b` to the original string `s`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the decoding process due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function.
