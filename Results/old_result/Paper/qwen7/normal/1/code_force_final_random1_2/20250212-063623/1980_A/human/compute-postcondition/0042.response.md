Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' which contains 't' elements. Each element in 'results' represents the value of 'missing' calculated for each iteration of the loop, where 'missing' is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between 'm' and each value in 'freq'.**

This means that for each iteration of the loop (ranging from 0 to t-1), the program calculates 'missing' as the sum of \(\max(0, m - freq[i])\) for all i from 0 to 6, and stores these values in the 'results' list.
