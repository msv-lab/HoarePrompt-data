Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is a list containing 1, `i` has been incremented by 1, `a` remains the same, and the input string `b` is greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is a list containing 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same, and `b` is an input string greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is a list containing 3, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same, and `b` is an input string. If the string `b` contains the character '1', the count of '1' in `b` is appended to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
