Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, with one list at index `u-1` now containing the value `[u-1, v-1], v is `v-1`.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list at index `u-1` in the `u2vs` list. Initially, the list at index `u-1` contains `[u-1]`. After executing the code, the list at index `u-1` will contain `[u-1, v-1]`. The values of `n` and `v` remain unchanged.
