Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the solution for the given problem. The functions defined in the program do not seem to address the problem statement at all. Specifically, the problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, none of the functions provided in the program appear to perform this calculation.

To verify this, let's consider a simple example:

- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 2\), the valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\) because:
  - For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 2\).
  - For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\).

However, the program does not contain any logic to compute these pairs. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.
