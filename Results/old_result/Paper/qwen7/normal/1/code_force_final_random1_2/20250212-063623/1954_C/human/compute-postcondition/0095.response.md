Output State: **`i` is 2; `new2[1]` is equal to `min(a[1], b[1])`; `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. The values of `new2[1]`, `a[1]`, and `b[1]` remain unchanged because they were not affected by the code.
