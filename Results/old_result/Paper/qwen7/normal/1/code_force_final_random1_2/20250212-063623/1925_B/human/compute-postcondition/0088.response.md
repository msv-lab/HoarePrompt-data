Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `sqrt(x)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\).
   - `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer.
   - `ans` is updated based on certain conditions involving `x` and `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended.
- `sqrt(x)` remains the same since it is calculated once at the beginning of the loop.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `sqrt(x)` remains unchanged.

Since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `sqrt(x)` remains the same.

The updated state is:
State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
