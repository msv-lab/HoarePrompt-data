Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from input, and if `t` does not equal 2, `start` remains unchanged; if `t` equals 2, `end` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `t` and `v`. The initial values of `i`, `num`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `start` and `end` remains the same based on the value of `t`.
