Output State: **`i` is 4; `array2` is [arr[3] - arr[2] * a, (arr[4] - arr[3]) * a]; `n` must still be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to `array2`. The new element is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 4, the new element becomes `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`. The existing element in `array2` remains `[arr[3] - arr[2] * a]` since no other changes were made to `array2`. The conditions for `n` being greater than 1 remain unchanged.
