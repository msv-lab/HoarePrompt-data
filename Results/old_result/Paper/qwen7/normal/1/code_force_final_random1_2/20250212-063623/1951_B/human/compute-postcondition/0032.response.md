Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is the length of the list `a`
- `x` is an integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement)
- `c` is 3
- `ind` is a list containing the value 1
- The condition `k` equals 14 holds true (though this condition is not relevant to the print statement)

The print statement is simply printing the list `ind`.

Given that `ind` is explicitly stated to contain the value 1, the output will be the list `[1]`.

Output: **[1]**
