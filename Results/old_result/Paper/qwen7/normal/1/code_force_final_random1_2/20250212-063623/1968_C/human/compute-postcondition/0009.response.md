Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`
   - `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 3.
   - `n` must still be at least 2 (it does not change based on the loop itself).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from 2 to 3.
   - `n` remains at least 2.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `a[1]` and `a[2]` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2**
