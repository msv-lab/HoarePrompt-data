Output State: **`countmins` is `count - 1`, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `g` is `int(n / 2)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(n / count)` to the variable `g`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` becomes `int(n / 2)`. The values of `countmins`, `ans`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
