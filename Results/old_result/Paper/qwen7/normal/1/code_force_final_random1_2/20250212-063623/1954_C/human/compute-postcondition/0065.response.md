Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
   - `b` is a list of integers created from the input string.
   - `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `max(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `max(a[i], b[i])`.
   - `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `min(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i < len(a)` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, so the condition `i < len(a)` is false.
   - To make the condition true, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Therefore, we need to decrease the value of `i` by 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to change `i` from `len(a)` to `len(a) - 1`.

Given these steps, the modified state right before the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `b` is a list of integers created from the input string, `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `max(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `max(a[i], b[i])`, and `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `min(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`**.
