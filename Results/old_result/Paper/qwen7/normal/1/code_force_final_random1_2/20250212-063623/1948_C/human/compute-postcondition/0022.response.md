Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `t` is reduced by 1 because the loop iterates over a range starting from `t` and decrementing until `t` reaches 0.

4. **Formulate the New State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be adjusted to `t - 1`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be a positive integer.
