Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Operations**: The logic in the code calculates the number of zeros (`'0'`) between the first and last chip positions (`'1'`). This does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left, which might involve more complex movements than just counting zeros.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The variable `z` is defined as a substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at `n - y - 1`. However, this does not account for the actual movement of chips to the left. Instead, it simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip positions, which is not a correct approach to solving the problem.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`, the output should be `1` because moving the chip from position 7 to position 5 achieves the goal.
   - For the input `6 0 1 0 0 0 0`, the output should be `0` because the chips are already in a single block.
   - For the input `6 1 1 1 1 1 1`, the output should be `0` because the chips are already in a single block.
   - For the input `5 1 0 1 0 1`, the output should be `2` because moving the chips from positions 2 and 4 to the left achieves the goal.
   - For the input `9 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`, the output should be `3` because moving the chips from positions 2, 5, and 8 to the left achieves the goal.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
