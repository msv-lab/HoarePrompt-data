Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n / 2`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is an empty list, `o` is 0, `z` is 0, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `mini = pow(10, 8)` sets `mini` to the value `100000000`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
