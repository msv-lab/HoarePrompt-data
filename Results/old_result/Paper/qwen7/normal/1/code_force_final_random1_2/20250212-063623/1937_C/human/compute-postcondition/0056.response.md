Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a string.
- `i` is equal to `i_end + 1`.
- `n` is the same as before (though `n` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `k` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it remains as `k` in the output. `i` is defined as `i_end + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:
Output: **? 0 k 0 i_end + 1**
