Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is undefined, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains 2**.

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `zero` was 1. After executing `zero += 1`, the value of `zero` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
