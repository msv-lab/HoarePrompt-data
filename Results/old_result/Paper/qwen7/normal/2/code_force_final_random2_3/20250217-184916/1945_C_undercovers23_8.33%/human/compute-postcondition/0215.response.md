Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in lst:`. This means the loop variable is `ele`, and the iterable is `lst`.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.

3. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is `n // 4`
   - `zero` is 5
   - `one` is 4
   - `zero_perc` is 55.6
   - `one_perc` is 100
   - `lst` contains `[2, 3, 4]`

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `lst`. Since `lst` contains `[2, 3, 4]`, the loop will execute three times.
   - For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `lst` contains at least one element. In this case, `lst` already contains `[2, 3, 4]`, which means it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `lst` must contain at least one element (which it already does).

Since no other variables in the loop head need adjustment, the final state is:

**State: **`lst` must contain at least one element**
