Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines if the sequence of "U" and "D" in `s` can balance out to zero by flipping some of the "U" to "D" or vice versa, and returns "Yes" if balanced, otherwise "No".**
