Output State: **`i` is `n`, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be `a[n-1] + k // n`. Since `k` is 0, `k // n` is 0 (integer division of 0 by any non-zero number is 0). Therefore, `r` becomes `a[n-1] + 0`, which simplifies to `a[n-1]`. The values of `i`, `k`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged.
