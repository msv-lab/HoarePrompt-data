Based on the initial state, `s2` is a string obtained by taking all characters of `s` except the first one and appending the first character of `s` to the end. 

Let's break this down:

1. Suppose `s` is a string, say "hello".
2. To form `s2`, we take all characters of `s` except the first one, which gives us "ello".
3. We then append the first character of `s` to the end of "ello", resulting in "elloh".

Therefore, if `s` is "hello", then `s2` would be "elloh".

Output: **elloh**
