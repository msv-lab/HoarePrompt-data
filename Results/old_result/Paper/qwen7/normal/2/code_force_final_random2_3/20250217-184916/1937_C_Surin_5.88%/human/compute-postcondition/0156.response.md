Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is an input from the user, and `prev` is unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `r = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `r`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `r` is set to the input from the user, its value is uncertain until the user provides an input. The condition for `prev` (which is set to 1 if `r` equals '>') is not met here because `r` is yet to be assigned a value.
