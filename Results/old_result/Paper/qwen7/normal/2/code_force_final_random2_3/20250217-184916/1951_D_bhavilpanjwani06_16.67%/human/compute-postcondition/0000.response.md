Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n` and `k` are now assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 1000.
