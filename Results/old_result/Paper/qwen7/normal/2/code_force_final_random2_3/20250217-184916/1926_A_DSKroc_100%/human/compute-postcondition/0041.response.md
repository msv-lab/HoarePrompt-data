Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 2 if `i` is 'A', and 1 otherwise, and `bc` is 0 if `i` is 'A', and 1 otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `ac += 1` increments the value of `ac` by 1. Since `ac` was initially 1 if `i` is 'A' and 0 otherwise, after executing this line, `ac` will be 2 if `i` is 'A' (because 1 + 1 = 2) and 1 otherwise (because 0 + 1 = 1). The value of `bc` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. The values of `s` and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
