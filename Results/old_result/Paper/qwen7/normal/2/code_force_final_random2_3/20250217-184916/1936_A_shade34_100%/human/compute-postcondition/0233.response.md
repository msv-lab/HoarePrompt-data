Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `len(pans)` must be `n`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak` is updated to `n-1`, while `n`, `i`, `pans`, and the length of `pans` remain as they were in the initial state.
