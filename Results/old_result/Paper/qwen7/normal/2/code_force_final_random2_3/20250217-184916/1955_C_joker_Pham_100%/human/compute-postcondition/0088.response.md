Output State: **`sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer equal to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r]` is 0; `l` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The values of `sunks`, `k`, `a[r]`, and `r` remain unchanged unless `a[r]` is 0, in which case `r` would be decremented by 1. Since no such condition is specified to change these variables, they retain their previous states except for `l`, which is now incremented by 1.
