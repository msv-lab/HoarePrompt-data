The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) and pairs of non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates a final value for \( t \) based on the initial value of \( b \), which is adjusted if \( b \) is even or odd. It then compares this adjusted value with \( a \) and further modifies \( t \) if necessary to ensure \( t1 \geq a \), where \( t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4 \). The function outputs the final value of \( t \) for each test case.
