Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, and `cnt[x]` is now `cnt[x] + 1**.

This means that the second element of the list `a` (which is `x`) has its count in the dictionary `cnt` incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
