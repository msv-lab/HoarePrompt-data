Postcondition: **`i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `el` is `'>', i` is `n - 4`, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, and `suffZero` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is `n - 3`, `suffZero` contains `0` and `n - 1`, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `n - 1` is less than or equal to `totalOne`, or `zeroInd - oneInd` otherwise.**
