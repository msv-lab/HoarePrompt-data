Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans2` contains the elements `[c[3], c[3]]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` (which is `c[3]`) to the list `ans2`. Since `ans2` initially contained the element `c[3]`, after appending `c[3]` again, `ans2` now contains `[c[3], c[3]]`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` must still be greater than 1 as per the initial condition.
