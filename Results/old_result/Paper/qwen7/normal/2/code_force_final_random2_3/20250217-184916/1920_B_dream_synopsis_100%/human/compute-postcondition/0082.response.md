Output State: **`sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `i` is within the range [1, k], `ans` now includes the updated value of `sums`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `sums`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain unchanged except that `sums` is added to the list `ans`.
