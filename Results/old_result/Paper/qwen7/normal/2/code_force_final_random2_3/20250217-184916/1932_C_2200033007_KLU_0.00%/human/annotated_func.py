#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `b` will contain all elements from the list `a` based on the instructions given by the string `s`. Specifically, for each 'L' in `s`, the corresponding element from `a` starting from index `l` (which starts at 0) will be appended to `b` and `l` will be incremented. For each 'R' in `s`, the corresponding element from `a` starting from index `r` (which starts at `n - 1`) will be appended to `b` and `r` will be decremented. After the loop completes, `b` will contain exactly `n` elements, and `l` will be equal to `n`, while `r` will be equal to `-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the final list `b` will be constructed by following the directions in string `s`, picking elements from the beginning or end of list `a` accordingly, until all elements of `a` are used, and both `l` and `r` will reflect their final positions after processing all elements of `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `p` will be equal to the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`, and `ans` will contain a list of `p` values after each iteration of the loop, starting from the first element of `b` up to the last element.
    #
    #In more detail, `p` will hold the cumulative product of all elements in the reversed list `b`. The list `ans` will contain each intermediate value of `p` as the loop progresses, with the final value of `p` being the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list of intermediate product values calculated during the loop, starting from the product of all elements in the reversed list `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from the start or end of list `a` based on the instructions in string `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in the reversed list `b`, storing each intermediate product value in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns a reversed list of these intermediate product values, starting from the product of all elements in `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.
