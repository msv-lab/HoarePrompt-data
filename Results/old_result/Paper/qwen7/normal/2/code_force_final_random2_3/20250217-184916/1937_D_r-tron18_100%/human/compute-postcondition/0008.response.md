Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, `el` equals '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `totalOne` to `ol` and `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. No other variables are affected, so their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are `ol` is `totalOne` and `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
