Output State: **After all iterations, `j` will be equal to `2 * n`, `n` will be at least 1, and `dp` will be equal to `new_dp`.**

Explanation: The line `dp = new_dp` assigns the value of `new_dp` to `dp`. This means that `dp` now holds the same values as `new_dp` after the updates. The conditions for `j` and `n` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within this line of code.
