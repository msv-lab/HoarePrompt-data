Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1; `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 2 or 8 depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is true or false.**

Explanation: The code `temp *= 2` multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2. Since `temp` was either 1 or 4 initially, it will now be either 2 (if `temp` was 1) or 8 (if `temp` was 4). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
