Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0; `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `required_mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code sets `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` to 0. This means the frequency count for the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is now 0. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
