Output State: **`d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is increased by the number of times the condition `d[j] >= 3` is satisfied for each `j` in `pl` during the previous iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `pl` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `d = {}` initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This operation does not affect the values of `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, or `pl`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
