Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
        y = i
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `i + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `i-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is `i`, and `y` is 1, assuming the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is true. If the condition is false, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is equal to `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `i + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `i-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is equal to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `y` is equal to `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `i` elements of `a[0]` and the `i-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is equal to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is updated to include the `i+1-th` element of `a[0]` and the `i-th` element of `a[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
