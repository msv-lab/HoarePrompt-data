Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(xa, ya)` and `(xb, yb)` respectively.

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`. If this condition is true, it directly prints "Draw". This is correct because if Alice's chip is initially in a lower row than Bob's, Alice cannot capture Bob's chip on her first move since Bob can always move up to avoid being captured.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The variable `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This represents half the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's initial positions.
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), the program calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`. This range represents the possible positions for Alice's chip such that Bob's chip is within this range.
   - The program then checks if the distance from `ya` to the boundaries of this range is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If so, it prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

4. **Even Difference Case:**
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, the program calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`. This range represents the possible positions for Bob's chip such that Alice's chip is within this range.
   - The program then checks if the distance from `yb` to the boundaries of this range is less than or equal to `x`. If so, it prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Correctness Verification:

- **Odd Difference Case:**
  - The logic correctly identifies that if the vertical distance is odd, Alice can always capture Bob if she moves optimally. This is because Bob cannot avoid being captured if Alice can move into the range `[l, r]` and the distance condition is met.
  - The boundary checks ensure that Alice can indeed capture Bob if she can move into the specified range.

- **Even Difference Case:**
  - The logic correctly identifies that if the vertical distance is even, Bob can always avoid being captured if he moves optimally. This is because Alice cannot force a capture if Bob can move into the specified range and the distance condition is not met.

- **Initial Comparison:**
  - The direct comparison `if xa > xb` correctly handles the scenario where Alice starts in a lower row, leading to an immediate draw.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
