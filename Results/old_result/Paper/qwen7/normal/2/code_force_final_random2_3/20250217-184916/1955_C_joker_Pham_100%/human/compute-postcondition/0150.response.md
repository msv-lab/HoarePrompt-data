Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and either `a[r]` is adjusted according to the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` (where `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `r` and `l` are updated accordingly), or the loop breaks due to `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` or `l` being less than or equal to `r`.
