Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` starting from index 2 and taking every second element.
   
2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Splitting `line`**:
   - Suppose `line` is a string. For example, let's assume `line = "a b c d e f g h i j k l"`.
   - Splitting `line` starting from index 2 and taking every second element means we start from the third character and take every second character.
   - So, the elements would be: `["c", "e", "g", "i", "k"]`.

2. **Creating the Set of Unique Elements**:
   - `{*elements}` creates a set from the list `elements`. In our example, the set would be `{"c", "e", "g", "i", "k"}`.

3. **Counting Each Element and Dividing by 3**:
   - For each unique element in the set, count how many times it appears in the original `elements` list and then divide by 3.
   - Since each element in our example set appears only once in the `elements` list, `elements.count(item)` for each item would be 1.
   - Therefore, `1 // 3` for each item would be `0`.

4. **Summing Up the Results**:
   - Summing up the results of `1 // 3` for each item in the set gives us `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

### Final Output:
Given the above steps, the expression inside the `print` function evaluates to `0`.

Output: **0**
