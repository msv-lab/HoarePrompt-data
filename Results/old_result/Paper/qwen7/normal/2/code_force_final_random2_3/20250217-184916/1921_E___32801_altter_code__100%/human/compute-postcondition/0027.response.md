Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by 1, `y1` is decreased by 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`**.

Explanation: The code `b = x2 - x1` calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. `x1` was increased by 1 and `y1` was decreased by 1 before this line of code, and these changes are still valid. `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. The value of `b` is now `x2 - x1`.
