Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `path` is a string, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `index`, `t`, `n`, `path`, and `data` as described in the initial state, with the addition of `results` being an empty list.
