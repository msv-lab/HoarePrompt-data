Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1 (though its exact value is not needed to determine the output).
- `i` is 2.
- `v2` is 2.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

However, there is no definition or initialization for the variable `v1` in the initial state provided. Since `v1` is not defined, it will result in a NameError if the code were to run. Given the instruction to use the most precise description possible based on the precondition and to provide the output as requested, we need to acknowledge that `v1` is undefined.

Output: **? v1 v1 2 2**
