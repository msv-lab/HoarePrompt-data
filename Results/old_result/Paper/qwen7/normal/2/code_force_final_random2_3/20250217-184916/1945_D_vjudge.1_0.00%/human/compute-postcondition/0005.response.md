The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a placeholder variable) and `numero_testes`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any state, we only need to consider `numero_testes`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `numero_testes`. If `numero_testes` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `func_1()` has been called. This means that the loop has executed at least once, so `numero_testes` must have been greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`func_1()` has been called, `numero_testes` must be greater than 1**
