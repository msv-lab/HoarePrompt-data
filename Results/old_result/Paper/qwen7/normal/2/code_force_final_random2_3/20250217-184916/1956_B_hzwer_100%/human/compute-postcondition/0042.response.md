Output State: `cnt` must contain at least as many elements as there are unique elements in list `a`; `ans` is increased by the maximum of 0 and `x` - 1 for each iteration, where `x` is each element in `cnt`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every unique count of elements in `a`. The variable `cnt` will hold the counts of each unique element in `a`, and it must include a count for every unique element present in `a`.
