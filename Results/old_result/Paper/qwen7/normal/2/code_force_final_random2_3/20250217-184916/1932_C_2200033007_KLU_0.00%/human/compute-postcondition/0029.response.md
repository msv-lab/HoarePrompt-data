Output State: **`p` is 1, `b` is constructed based on the instructions in string `s`, `ans` is an empty list, `l` is equal to `n`, and `r` is equal to `-1`.**

The code `p = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `p`. None of the other variables (`b`, `ans`, `l`, `r`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
