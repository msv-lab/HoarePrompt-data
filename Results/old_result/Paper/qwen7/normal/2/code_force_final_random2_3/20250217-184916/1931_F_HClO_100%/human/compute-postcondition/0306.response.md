Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples (`a3`, `l3`)**.

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. Since `val` was previously defined as a list containing two tuples (`a3`, `l3`), its value remains unchanged. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 2 is not affected by this code.
