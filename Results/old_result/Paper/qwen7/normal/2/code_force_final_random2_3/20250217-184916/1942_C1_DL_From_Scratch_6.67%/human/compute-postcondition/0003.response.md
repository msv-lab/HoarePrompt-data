Output State: **`T` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input split; `list0` is a list containing integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `list0`. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The precondition that `T` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, is still valid.
