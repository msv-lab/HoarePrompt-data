Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

The code `arr = input()` assigns the string input by the user to the variable `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
