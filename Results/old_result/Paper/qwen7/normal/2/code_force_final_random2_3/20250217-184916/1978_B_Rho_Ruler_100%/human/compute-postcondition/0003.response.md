Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is (0 + high) // 2.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is therefore half of `high` (rounded down). The values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged from their initial state.
