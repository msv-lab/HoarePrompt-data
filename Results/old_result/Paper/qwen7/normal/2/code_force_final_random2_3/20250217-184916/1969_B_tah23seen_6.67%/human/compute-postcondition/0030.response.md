Output State: **`left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - left + 1`, `right` is 5, `s[1]` must not be '1', and `s[4]` must not be '1'**.

Explanation: The variable `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `cost`, `right`, `s[1]`, and `s[4]`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
