To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is:
\[ (x + y) \times x \leq n \]
\[ (x + y) \times y \leq m \]

Given the current state:
- \( x = 1 \)
- \( n \) must be at least 3
- \( m \) must be at least 6
- \( cnt = 2 \)
- \( y = 3 \)

Let's evaluate the loop condition with these values:
1. Calculate \( x + y \):
   \[ x + y = 1 + 3 = 4 \]

2. Evaluate the first part of the condition:
   \[ (x + y) \times x = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]
   Since \( n \) must be at least 3, this part of the condition is satisfied as long as \( n \geq 4 \).

3. Evaluate the second part of the condition:
   \[ (x + y) \times y = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]
   Since \( m \) must be at least 6, this part of the condition is satisfied as long as \( m \geq 12 \).

For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition must be true. Therefore, we need to ensure that:
- \( n \) is at least 4
- \( m \) is at least 12

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition depends only on \( n \) and \( m \).

State: **`x` is 1, `n` must be at least 4, `m` must be at least 12, `cnt` is 2, `y` is 3**
