Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, each containing parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array of integers `a`. It calculates the total count of "beautiful pairs" for each test case based on the frequency of specific modulo pairs. A "beautiful pair" is defined by the conditions `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` derived from the given `x` and `y` values. The function returns a list of counts, where each count corresponds to the total number of beautiful pairs found for each test case.**
