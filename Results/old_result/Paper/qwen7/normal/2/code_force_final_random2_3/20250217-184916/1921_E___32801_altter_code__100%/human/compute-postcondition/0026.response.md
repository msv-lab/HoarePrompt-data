Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by 1, `y1` is decreased by 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `a` is `y2 - 1`. Otherwise, `a` is `m - y2`.**
