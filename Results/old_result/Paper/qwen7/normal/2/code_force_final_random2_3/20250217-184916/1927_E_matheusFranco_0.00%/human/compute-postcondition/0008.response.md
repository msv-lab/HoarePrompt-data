Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within this function call (no assignments or operations affecting `t` are provided), the precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information updated is that `t` must still be greater than 0.
