Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is `num % x`; `beautiful_count` is unchanged; `freq` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modulus of `num` with `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. The values of `num`, `beautiful_count`, and `freq` remain unchanged from their initial states.
