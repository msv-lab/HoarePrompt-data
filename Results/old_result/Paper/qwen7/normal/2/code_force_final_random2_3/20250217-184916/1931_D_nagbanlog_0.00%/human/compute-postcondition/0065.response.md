Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`.
- `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

Given the current state, the values of the variables inside the print statement are not explicitly defined. Specifically, `num`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can describe them based on the formulas provided.

- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

Since the exact values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are not specified, we can only describe the print statement in terms of these variables.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [num % x], required_mod_y: [num % y]**
