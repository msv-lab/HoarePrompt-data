Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues:

1. **Random Sampling**: The `random.sample` function does not guarantee that the generated string `s2` will always be different from `s`. If `s` consists of unique characters, `random.sample(s, len(s))` will generate the same string `s`.

2. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The condition `if len(s) == 1:` correctly identifies that no rearrangement can be made for single-character strings, so printing 'No' is appropriate. However, the handling of strings with repeated characters needs to be more robust.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: For strings where all characters are the same (e.g., "aaaaa"), the current logic will incorrectly return 'Yes' and then try to rearrange, which will fail due to the check `if s == s2:`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            while s2 == s:
                s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            print('YES')
            print(s2)

func()
```

This version ensures that `s2` is different from `s` by using a loop to keep generating new permutations until a different one is found.
