Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is simply `for _ in range(k):`. The only variable mentioned here is `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `k`**: From the given information, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`. This means that `k` is a non-negative integer (since it represents the number of iterations for the loop).

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1 because `range(k)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `k-1`. If `k` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on `k`, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. The other variables listed (like `combined`, `max_profit`, `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`, and `current_profit`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` being greater than 0.

**State: **`k` must be greater than 0**
