Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `index` is 5
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` is equal to `data[3]`
   - `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"
   - `results` is a list
   - `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, we need to decrement `t` by 1.
   - All other variables (`index`, `n`, `s`, `results`, `num_up_coins`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`index` is 5, `t` is 0, `n` is equal to `data[3]`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list, `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`**
