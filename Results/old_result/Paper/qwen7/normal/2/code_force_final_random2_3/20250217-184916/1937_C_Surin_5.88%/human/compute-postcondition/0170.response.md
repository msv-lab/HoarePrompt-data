Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and interacts with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) which is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). The function can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.**

This means the function does not take any explicit parameters but works with an internal permutation and can make queries to find the maximum XOR value between any two elements in the permutation.
