Output State: **Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digit of `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If at any point during the loop's execution, `arr[i]` is found to be less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to `False`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `m` will still be greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be 0, and `arr[i]` will be equal to the first element of the list `nums`, which contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digit of `arr[i]`. The variable `ans` will remain `True` unless at any point during the loop's execution, it is found that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, in which case `ans` will be set to `False`.
