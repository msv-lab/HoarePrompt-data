Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in a:`. The key variables here are `num` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop body behavior**:
   - `a` is not empty.
   - `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - The variable `num` is the current element being processed in the loop.
   - The variable `a` remains the same list throughout the loop, but its elements are being iterated over.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `a` is not empty, it means there are still elements left to process.
   - The next element `num` will be the next item in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` itself does not change in terms of its contents or length; it just moves to the next element.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The list `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in the list `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `num` is the next element in the list `a`**
