Output State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `expression`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. The initial state of `expression` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, `count` is set to 0, and `expression` and `n` retain their initial values.
