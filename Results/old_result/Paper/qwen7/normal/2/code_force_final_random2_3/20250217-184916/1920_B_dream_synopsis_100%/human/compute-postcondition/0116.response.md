Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated as follows:
- If `i` is equal to 0, then `ans` contains `sums` which is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- If `i` is not equal to 0, then `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.
