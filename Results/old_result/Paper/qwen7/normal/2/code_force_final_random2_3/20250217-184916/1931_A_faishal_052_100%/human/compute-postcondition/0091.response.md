Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The range specified is `range(2)`, meaning `j` will take values from 0 to 1.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `lex` is an integer.
   - `arr` contains 26.
   - `j` is 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `j` is less than 2.
   - Since `j` is currently 1, it will still be less than 2, and the loop will execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will increment by 1 from 1 to 2, but since the loop range is `range(2)`, `j` will not exceed 1 and the loop will terminate after this iteration.
   - `lex` and `arr` will remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are mentioned for these variables within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case is the termination of the loop) will be:

**State: **`lex` is an integer, `arr` contains 26, `j` is 2**
