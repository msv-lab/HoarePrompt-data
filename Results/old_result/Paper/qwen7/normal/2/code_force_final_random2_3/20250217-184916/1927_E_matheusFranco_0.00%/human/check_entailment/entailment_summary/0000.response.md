Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where a k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length k is at most 1.
2. The provided solution consists of two functions:
   - `func_1()`: This function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user, constructs a permutation list, and prints it.
   - `func_2()`: This function processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

3. Let's analyze `func_1()`:
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - It iterates over indices `i` from `0` to `k-1` and sets every `i * k`-th element starting from index `k` to `i + 1`.
   - This means the elements are set as follows:
     - `permutation[k] = 1`
     - `permutation[k + k] = 2`
     - `permutation[2*k] = 3`
     - And so on...
   - The resulting permutation will look like this for `n=10` and `k=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3]`.

4. Now, let's check if this construction meets the k-level permutation criteria:
   - The sums of continuous segments of length `k` will be calculated as follows:
     - For `n=10` and `k=4`, the segments are `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, `[0, 1, 0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `[2, 0, 0, 0]`, `[0, 2, 0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 2, 0]`, `[0, 0, 0, 2]`, `[3, 0, 0, 0]`.
     - The sums of these segments are: `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `2`, `2`, `2`, `2`, `3`.
   - The maximum sum is `3` and the minimum sum is `1`, so the difference is `2`, which is greater than `1`. Therefore, this construction does not satisfy the k-level permutation criteria.

5. Since `func_1()` does not produce a k-level permutation, the entire program cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
