Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `numInteger`. This means `numInteger` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The conditions for `numCases` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
