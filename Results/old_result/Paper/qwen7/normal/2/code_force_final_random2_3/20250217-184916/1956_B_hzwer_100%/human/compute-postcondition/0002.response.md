Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The precondition for `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect `t`.
