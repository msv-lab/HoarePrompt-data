Output State: `a` is a list starting with the integer 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each calculated as the difference between the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`. The loop has executed `n-1` times, so `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` remains unchanged from its initial state. The variable `T` remains unchanged, and all other variables (`t`, `x`, `line`, and `n`) also remain in their initial states.

In more detail:
- The list `a` starts with `[1000]`.
- For each iteration of the loop (from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`), the last element of `a` is updated to `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
- After `n-1` iterations, `a` will have `n` elements, where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`.
- The variable `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The variables `t`, `x`, `line`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial states.
