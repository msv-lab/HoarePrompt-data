Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string without the word 'map', `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**.

Explanation: The code `p = s.count('pie')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns the result to the variable `p`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
