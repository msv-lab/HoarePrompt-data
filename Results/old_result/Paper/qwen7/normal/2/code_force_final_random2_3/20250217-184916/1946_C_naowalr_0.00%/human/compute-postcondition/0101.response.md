Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the default starting point for `range`).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute as long as `n - 1` is a positive integer. This means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `z` is initially set to `t`, but this variable is not used in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `z`.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input, but this variable is not used in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `k`.
   - `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list, but this variable is not used in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `adj`.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are related to `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list**
