Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `k` must be greater than 0, and `heap` will contain up to `k` elements, each being the smallest element from `combined` that was popped during each iteration of the loop. The current_profit is the result of calling `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `combined` does not have enough elements to fill `heap`, then `heap` will contain fewer than `k` elements, but all elements in `heap` will be the smallest available from `combined` during each iteration. The other variables such as `combined`, `max_profit`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `current_profit` will retain their states from the last iteration of the loop, with no further changes applied.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been updated to the value returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)`. The values of `k` and `heap` remain as they were after the loop, with `heap` containing the smallest elements from `combined` according to the loop's logic. All other variables retain their states from the last iteration of the loop without any further changes.
