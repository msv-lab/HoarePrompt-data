You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list of integers `a` and an integer `x`, and calculates a maximum count based on certain conditions. Specifically, it iterates over bits from the most significant to the least significant (29 to 0). For each bit position, it checks the bit value of `x` and the sum of corresponding bits in the list `a`. If certain conditions are met, it updates a counter `ans` or returns early. Finally, it returns the maximum value between `ans` (if defined) and the length of the list `a`. If `ans` is not defined, it returns 28.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing Functions:**
   - `func_1()`: Reads and splits input into a list of integers.
   - `func_2()`: Reads and returns an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Reads and maps input to integers.
   - `func_4()`: Reads and returns a string.

2. **Main Function (`func_5`):**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `n` and `x` are read and parsed.
     - An empty list `t` and `-1` are assigned to `ans`.
   - **Loop over bits from 29 to 0:**
     - For each bit position `i`, calculate `u` and `v`:
       - `u` is the value of the `i-th` bit of `x`.
       - `v` is the sum of the `i-th` bit of all elements in `a`.
     - If both `u` and `v` are zero, continue to the next iteration.
     - If `u` is zero and `v` is odd, return `ans` immediately because it means no valid segment can be formed.
     - If `u` is zero and `v` is even, split the array into segments where the `i-th` bit is zero and update `t` with the cumulative XOR of these segments.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is odd, continue to the next iteration.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is even, count the number of segments where the `i-th` bit is zero and update `ans` if this count is greater than the current `ans`.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is zero, break the loop because no further segments can be added.

3. **Final Output:**
   - Return the maximum of `ans` and the length of `a`.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.
- The function iterates over each bit position from 29 to 0, which ensures that all possible segmentations are considered.
- The logic for handling different cases (both `u` and `v` being zero, `u` being zero and `v` being odd, etc.) is implemented correctly.
- The final output is the maximum suitable number `k` or `-1` if no valid segmentation exists.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
