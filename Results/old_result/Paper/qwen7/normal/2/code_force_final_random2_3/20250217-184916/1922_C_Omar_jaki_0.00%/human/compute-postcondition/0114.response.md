Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least 6 elements, `u` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `c` is the return value from function `r()`, and `d` is the return value from function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` remains the return value from function `r()` and `d` remains the return value from function `r()`. Otherwise, `c` is the return value from function `r()` and `d` is the return value from function `r()`, with the condition that `c` is not less than `d`.
