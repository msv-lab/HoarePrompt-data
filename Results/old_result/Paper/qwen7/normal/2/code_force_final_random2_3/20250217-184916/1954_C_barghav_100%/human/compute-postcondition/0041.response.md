Postcondition: `a` must have at least one character, `i` is 2, and `f` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than `b[2]`, otherwise `f` remains 0. If `f` is 1, then either `a[2]` and `b[2]` are swapped (if `a[2] > b[2]`) or they remain unchanged (if `a[2] <= b[2]`). If `f` is 0, then `a[2]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged regardless of their values.
