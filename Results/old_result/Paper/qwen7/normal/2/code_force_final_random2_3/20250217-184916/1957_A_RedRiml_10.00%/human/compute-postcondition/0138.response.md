Output State: **`palka` is not empty, `i` is the next element of `palka`, `pl` contains the element `i`, `d[i]` is set to 2 if `d.get(i)` was not None, otherwise it is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` is the next element of `palka`, `pl` now contains this element. The dictionary `d` is updated such that if `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to `1`; otherwise, `d[i]` is set to `2`.
