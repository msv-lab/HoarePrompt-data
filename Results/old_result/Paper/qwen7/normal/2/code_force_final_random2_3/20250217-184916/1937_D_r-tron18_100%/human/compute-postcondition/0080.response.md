Output State: **`i` is `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to itself.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `suffZero` list. This new element is calculated as the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`. Since `i` is either `n - 5` or `n - 4`, the new element appended to `suffZero` will be `suffZero[-1] + (n - 5) + 1` or `suffZero[-1] + (n - 4) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
