Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is increased by `a`.
- `y1` is decreased by `1 + a`.
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r`.
- `y2` is either `m` or `1` depending on the condition.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `b` is `x2 - x1`.
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- `x2` is decreased by `a`.
- `b // 2 > a` holds.
- `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c` holds, where `c` is `m - y1` if `y2 == m` or `y1 - 1` if `y2 == 1`.

The print statement is `print('Alice')`.

Given this, the output will be a string literal "Alice".

Output: **Alice**
