Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is an empty list, `check_all_new` is True, and `new_all` is True, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. The resulting list `a` is updated, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) remain unchanged in their initial states.
