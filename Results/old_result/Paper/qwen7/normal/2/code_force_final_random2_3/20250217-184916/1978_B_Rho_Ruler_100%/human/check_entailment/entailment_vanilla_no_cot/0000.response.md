Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. 

- `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k` value, which is used to evaluate different scenarios.
- `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal `k` value that maximizes the profit. It iteratively narrows down the range of possible `k` values and uses `func_1` to compute the profit for the midpoint and its adjacent values to decide whether to move the search range up or down.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach is efficient and correctly identifies the maximum profit.
