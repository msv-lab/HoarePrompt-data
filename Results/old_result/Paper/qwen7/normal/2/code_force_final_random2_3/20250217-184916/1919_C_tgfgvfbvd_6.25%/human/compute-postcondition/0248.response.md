Output State: **`x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`, `b` is the value at index `x` of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `x` is still `x + 1`, `n` must still be greater than `x + 1`, and `b` now holds the value at index `x` of list `l`.
