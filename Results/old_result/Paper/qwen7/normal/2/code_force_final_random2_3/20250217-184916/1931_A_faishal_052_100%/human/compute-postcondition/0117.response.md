Output State: **`j` must take on the values 0 and 1, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the value 26.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `j` and `lex` were not affected by this operation, their conditions remain the same. The list `arr` now contains the value 26.
