Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` includes the element at index 0 of `l`, `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l`**

The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from the initial state but not affecting the values of `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2`. Therefore, `i` becomes 1, while `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged as they are dependent on the list `l` and their respective indices, which are not altered by the given code.
