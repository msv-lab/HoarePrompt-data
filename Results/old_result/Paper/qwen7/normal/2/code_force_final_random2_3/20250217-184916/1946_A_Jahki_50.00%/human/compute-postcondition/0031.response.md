Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` must be greater than `median`, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of `b`, and `median` must be greater than `b[ma]`; `b[ma]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
