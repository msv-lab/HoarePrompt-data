Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

The code `info = input().split()` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. The initial conditions for `T` and `t` remain unchanged.
