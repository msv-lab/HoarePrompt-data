Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
   - `new_all` is a boolean value indicating if the elements in `new` from index 0 to len(new)-1 are in non-decreasing order.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Updating the Conditions**:
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `check_all_new` and `new_all` remain the same as they are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating if the elements in `new` from index 0 to len(new)-1 are in non-decreasing order.**
