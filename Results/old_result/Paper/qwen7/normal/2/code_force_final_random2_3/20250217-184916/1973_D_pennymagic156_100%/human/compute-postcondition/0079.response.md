Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Loop Condition Variables:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   ```
   while cnt and l < n + 1:
   ```
   This means the loop continues as long as both `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be non-zero (`truthy`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given these conditions:
- `cnt` is already `k - 2`, which is non-zero if `k > 2`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`. To ensure `l < n + 1`, `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 1` is less than `n + 1`.

### Conclusion

Since `cnt` is already non-zero, no adjustment is needed for `cnt`. However, `l` must be adjusted to ensure it remains less than `n + 1` for the next iteration.

### Final Answer

State: **`cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` must be `func_2() + 1` and `func_2() + 1` must be less than `n + 1`**
