Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`.
- `final` is either an empty list or a list containing 0 and sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`.
- If `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains those elements; otherwise, `final` now contains the integer `n`.
- The loop variable `_` is used, indicating that the loop does not depend on any specific variable.

### Loop Statement
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs `t` times.
- The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, it does not affect the values of `mini`, `final`, `o`, `n`, or `pk`.

### Adjusting States
Since the loop variable `_` is not used, no changes are needed for `mini`, `final`, `o`, `n`, or `pk`. The only thing that changes is the number of iterations left.

### New State
- The loop will run one more time, so `t` is reduced by 1.
- All other states remain the same.

### Final Answer
State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` is either an empty list or a list containing 0 and sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`, `o` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `pk` remains the same, and `t` is decreased by 1.**
