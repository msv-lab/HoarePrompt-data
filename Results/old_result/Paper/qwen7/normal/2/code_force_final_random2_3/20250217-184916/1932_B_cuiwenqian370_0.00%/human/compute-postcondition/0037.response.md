Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp[3]` is `-inf`, `dp[i]` is `-inf`**

Explanation: The code `dp[i] = -float('inf')` assigns the value `-inf` to `dp[i]`. Since `i` is 3, `dp[3]` is updated to `-inf`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp[3]` is `-inf`. Additionally, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[3]`) is also `-inf`.
