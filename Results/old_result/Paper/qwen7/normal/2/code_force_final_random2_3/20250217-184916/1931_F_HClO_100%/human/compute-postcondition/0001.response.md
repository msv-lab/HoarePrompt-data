Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head:
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop variable is `_` (a placeholder typically used when the loop variable is not needed) and the loop will run `t` times.

2. Determine which states need to be adjusted:
   - The only variable mentioned in the loop head is `t`.
   - The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will execute.

3. Consider the initial state:
   - Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of an integer input.

4. Adjust the state for the loop to execute:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`, and `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be a positive integer.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer**
