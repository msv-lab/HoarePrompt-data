Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` is now `val >> i & 1` (where `i` is the current index during the iteration), and `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with `val`, and `ai` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing the XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. Initially, `ai` was set to 1. After performing the XOR operation, `ai` becomes `1 ^ val`. Since the initial value of `ai` is 1, the new value of `ai` will be `0` if `val` is 1, and `1` if `val` is 0. However, without knowing the exact value of `val`, we express it as `ai` being updated to `1 ^ val`, which simplifies to `0` given the initial value of `ai` is 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
