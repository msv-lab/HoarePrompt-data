Output State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are assigned or modified by this line of code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
