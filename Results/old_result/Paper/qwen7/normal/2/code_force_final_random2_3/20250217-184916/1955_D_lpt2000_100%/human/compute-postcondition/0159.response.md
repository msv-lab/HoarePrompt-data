Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `aa`, `m`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `fnd`: This variable is given as 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and 0 otherwise. However, this variable is not directly involved in the loop head.
   - `aa`: This is a list, but its content is not specified.
   - `m` and `n`: These are indices used in the slicing operation `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are valid pairs to iterate over. Specifically, the loop will run as long as `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` are non-empty.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - For the loop to execute, both slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` must be non-empty.
   - Therefore, `m` and `n` must be such that the slices are non-empty. This means `m < n` and `n - m > 0`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` and `n` to ensure the slices are non-empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 0**
