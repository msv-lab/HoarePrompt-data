Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `temp` to 1. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
