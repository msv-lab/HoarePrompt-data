Postcondition: `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains 26 and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 52.
