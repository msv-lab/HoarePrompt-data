Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1**.

The code `pairs_in_D += 1` increases the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
