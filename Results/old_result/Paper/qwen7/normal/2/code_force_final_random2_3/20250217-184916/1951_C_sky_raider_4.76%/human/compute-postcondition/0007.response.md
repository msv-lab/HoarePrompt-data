Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

The code assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`. Since the initial values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, they remain the same. The value of `s` is determined by comparing `m` and `k`, but without specific values for `m` and `k`, `s` is simply expressed as the minimum of these two variables.
