Output State: **`empty` is True, `t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains 1 integer such that 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `tree` is an empty deque.**

Explanation: The code simply sets the variable `empty` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, the list of starting nodes, `n`, or the `tree` deque. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
