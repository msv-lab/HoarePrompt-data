Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `k` is 0
   - `i` is `n-1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postconditions given, we know:
     - If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.
     - If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `i` is decremented by 1.
     - In both cases, `k` remains 0.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range of the loop, i.e., `1 <= i < n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, it cannot be decremented further because it would go out of the valid range of the loop (which starts from 1).

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - To prepare for the next iteration, `i` needs to be set to the next value in the range, which is 1.

7. **Postcondition for the Next Iteration:**
   - `k` remains 0.
   - `i` is set to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 1**
