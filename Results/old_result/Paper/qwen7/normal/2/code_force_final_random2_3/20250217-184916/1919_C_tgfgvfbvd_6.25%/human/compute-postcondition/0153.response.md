Output State: **`y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `x` is `n`, `a` is `l[n]`**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `a`. Since `x` is equal to `n`, `a` is assigned the value at index `n` of list `l`. The values of `y` and `n` remain unchanged, and `x` retains its value as `n`.
