Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of length 32 where the last element is '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false, and the 2nd element of `s` is updated accordingly. If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, the last element of `s` is '1'. Otherwise, `s` has an additional '0' appended to it.**
