Output State: `nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with length 30, and each element in `s` is either '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit (from 0 to 29) of `x` is set or not.

This means that after the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will contain 30 elements, where each element corresponds to one of the bits in the binary representation of `x`. The index of each element in `s` (ranging from 0 to 29) represents the position of the bit in `x`, and the value ('1' or '0') indicates whether that bit is set (1) or not (0) in the integer `x`.
