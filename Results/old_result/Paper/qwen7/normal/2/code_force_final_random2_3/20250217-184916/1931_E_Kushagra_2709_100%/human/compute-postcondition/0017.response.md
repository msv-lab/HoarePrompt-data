Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is len(`num`) - 3, `tot` is 3, and if `num[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `tot` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
