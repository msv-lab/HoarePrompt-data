Output State: **`fnd` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `pairs_in_D -= 1` decreases the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given conditions.
