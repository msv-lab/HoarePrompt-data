Output State: `i` is `isqrt(x) + 1`, `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop, which is the largest integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i` and either `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is greater than `i`.

In simpler terms, `ans` will hold the greatest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and also satisfies the condition related to `n`.
