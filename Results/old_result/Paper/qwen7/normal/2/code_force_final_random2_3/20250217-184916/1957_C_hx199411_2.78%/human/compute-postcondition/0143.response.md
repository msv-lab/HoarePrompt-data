Postcondition: **`m`, `n`, `i`, `num`, `c`, and `r` retain their values from the precondition. If `m` is 0, then `n` equals `num`. Otherwise, `m` is `n - num`, and the list `dp` contains values from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` where each value `dp[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `m`) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.**
