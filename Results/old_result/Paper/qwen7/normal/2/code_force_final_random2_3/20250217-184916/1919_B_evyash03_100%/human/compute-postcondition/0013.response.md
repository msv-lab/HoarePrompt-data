Output State: **`expression` remains unchanged, `count` holds the total number of '+' characters in `expression`, `sub` is equal to `length - count`**.

In this case, `sub` is calculated as the difference between the length of the string `expression` and the value of `count`, which is the total number of '+' characters in `expression`. Therefore, `sub` is specifically `length - count`.
