Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `mid` - 1, `mid` is (0 + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` is not greater than `profit_mid`.**

Explanation: The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to be `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
