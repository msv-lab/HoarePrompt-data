Output State: `x` is 1, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 30, `cnt` is 10, `y` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. Given the pattern from the first three iterations, we can infer that each iteration increments `y` by 1 and updates `cnt` based on the minimum division results. After 5 iterations, `y` will be 5. For the loop to continue until `y` reaches 5, `n` must be at least 10 and `m` must be at least 30, as the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` need to hold true. The value of `cnt` will be the sum of the minimum division results from each iteration, which totals to 10 in this case.
