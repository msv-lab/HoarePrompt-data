State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, results is an empty list, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. The loop condition `range(t)` means the loop will run `t` times if `t` is a positive integer.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100 (inclusive).
4. The initial state of `results` is already given as an empty list, which is correct.
5. The initial value of `i` should be set to 0 to match the starting point of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `results` is an empty list, and `i` is 0.
