Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is an empty string, and `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.**

The code `res = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
