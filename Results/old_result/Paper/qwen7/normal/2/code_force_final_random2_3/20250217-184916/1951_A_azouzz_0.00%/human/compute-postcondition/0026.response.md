Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`. If the count of '1' in the string `s` is greater than 2 and even, then `cnt1` remains greater than 2 and even. Otherwise, the count of '1' in the string `s` is less than or equal to 2 or even, and if the count of '1' is greater than 2 and either odd or exactly 1, then the count of '1' is at least 2 and even, or the substring '11' is present in the string `s`. If the count of '1' is less than or equal to 2 or even and not odd or equal to 1, then the substring '11' is not present in the string `s`.
