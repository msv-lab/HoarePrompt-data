Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = []` initializes an empty list named `ans2`. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the addition of `ans2` being an empty list.
