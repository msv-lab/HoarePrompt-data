Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `n`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from the initial state since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the conditions related to `n` and the if statement remain as they were initially.
