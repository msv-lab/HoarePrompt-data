Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `n // i`, `n` is decreased by `i * curr`**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. The values of `costs` and `h` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `n` after the subtraction.
