Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. It returns a value based on these inputs.**
