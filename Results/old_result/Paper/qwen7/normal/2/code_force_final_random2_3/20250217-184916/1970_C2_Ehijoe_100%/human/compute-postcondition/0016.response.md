Output State: `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, for every node `v` in the `nodes` dictionary, the list associated with `v` contains all the nodes directly connected to `v`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `n-1` times), the variable `i` will be `n-2`. The loop continues appending the second integer of each input pair to the list of the first integer in the `nodes` dictionary, ensuring that each node points to all nodes it is directly connected to in the tree. Thus, for every node `v`, the list `nodes[v]` will contain all nodes directly connected to `v`.
