Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list until no more pairs could be formed.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.sort(reverse=False)` sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order. The other variables (`numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, and `suma`) remain unchanged.
