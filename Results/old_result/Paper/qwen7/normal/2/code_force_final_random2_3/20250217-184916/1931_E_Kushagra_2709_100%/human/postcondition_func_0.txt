The function accepts three parameters: `n`, representing the number of integers in the list; `m`, determining when Sasha wins; and `nums`, a list of integers. It calculates the total length of the string representations of all numbers in `nums`, sorts a count of zeros in each number in descending order, and then subtracts every second element from this sorted list starting from the first element. Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the resulting total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
