Output State: **The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.**

This means that after the loop completes, the `dp` list contains values calculated based on the conditions specified (either the maximum of the previous two elements plus 1 if the current character is '@', or minus infinity if the current character is '*'). The return statement then finds and returns the highest value in the `dp` list that is not equal to negative infinity, reflecting the maximum possible sum of consecutive '@' characters under the given constraints.
