State: **`temp` is '', `i` is 4, `j` is 0, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable in the for loop is `j`.
2. The loop runs for each value in `range(3)`, meaning `j` will take values from 0 to 2.
3. For the loop to execute, `j` must start from 0 and go up to 2.
4. The initial state of `j` is 0, which is correct for the loop to start.
5. The other variables (`temp`, `i`, and `cases`) do not affect the loop's execution directly.
6. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `cases`, which must be at least 3 to ensure the loop runs for 3 iterations.

Thus, the final state is: **`temp` is '', `i` is 4, `j` is 0, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
