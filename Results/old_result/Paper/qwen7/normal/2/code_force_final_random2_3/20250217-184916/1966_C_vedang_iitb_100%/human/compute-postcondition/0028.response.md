Postcondition: `tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements removed, `maxsize` is 0 (since the list `a` is now empty), and `mexsize` is 5. If the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `mexsize` also remains unchanged.
