Output State: **`t` is now `b`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split.**

The code `t = b` assigns the value of `b` to `t`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
