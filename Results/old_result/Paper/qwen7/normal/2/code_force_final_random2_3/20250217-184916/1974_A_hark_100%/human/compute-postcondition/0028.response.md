Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`, `x` is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the second integer input, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 <= 0` else `math.ceil((x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `bxsfory1` based on the condition of `x`. Specifically, `bxsfory1` is set to 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise, it is set to the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
