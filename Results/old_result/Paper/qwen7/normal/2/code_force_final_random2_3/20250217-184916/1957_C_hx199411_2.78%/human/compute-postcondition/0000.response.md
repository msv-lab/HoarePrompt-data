Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.**

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained between 1 and 10^4, while the other conditions and variables related to `n` and `k`, and the moves of the rooks, remain as stated in the initial precondition.
