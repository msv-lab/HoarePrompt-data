Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions needed to make a string beautiful, meaning it should not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
- The provided code attempts to solve this by first checking if the string is exactly "mapie", which is incorrect because "mapie" is not a valid input according to the problem statement.
- The code then incorrectly handles the removal of substrings. It only removes "map" and "pie" sequentially without considering the overlap between these substrings. For example, if a string contains both "map" and "pie", the current implementation might remove them separately, leading to unnecessary deletions.
- The execution summary mentions that the function returns 6 if `s` contains 'pi', but this is not accurate. The function should correctly count the minimum deletions required to remove all instances of "pie" and "map".

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
