Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is initialized to `n`, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `v = func_2()` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `v`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `v`. However, we know that `v` now holds whatever value `func_2()` returns. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
