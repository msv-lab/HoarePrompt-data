Output State: **`i` is 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1), `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] != '0'` is met, `one_perc` is recalculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `zero_perc` is updated to the value of `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `zero`, and `one` remain unchanged unless the condition `s[i] != '0'` is met, which would increase `one` by 1.
- The condition for `lst` remains the same, i.e., if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`.
