Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer with the value 2, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. Since `idx2` is `n - 2`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at the `n-2` index. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
