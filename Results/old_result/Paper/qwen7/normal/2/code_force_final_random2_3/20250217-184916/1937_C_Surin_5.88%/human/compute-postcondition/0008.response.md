Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `v2` is 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

However, the value of `v1` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since `v1` is not defined or given any explicit value, we cannot determine its value from the provided information. Therefore, `v1` will remain as it is in the print statement.

Given this, the print statement will output the placeholders for `v1` and `v2` as they are.

Output: **? v1 v1 1 1**
