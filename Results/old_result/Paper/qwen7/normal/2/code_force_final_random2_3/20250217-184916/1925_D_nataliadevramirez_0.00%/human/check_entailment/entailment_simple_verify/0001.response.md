### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic and mathematical formulation used in the program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure everything aligns with the problem statement and the provided code.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each friendship and calculates the expected value contribution for each friendship.
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is correctly calculated using the formula \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).
   - The result is summed up and returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions.
   - It reads the list of friendships and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \) is derived from the probability of choosing a specific pair in each excursion. Since there are \( \binom{n}{2} \) possible pairs, the probability of choosing a specific pair in one excursion is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \). Over `k` excursions, the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen is \( k \times \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \times k = \frac{2k^2}{n(n-1)} \approx \frac{k^2}{\binom{n}{2}} \). Simplifying this, we get \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits and avoids overflow issues.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no friendships by returning 0.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The original assessment accurately describes the correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**
