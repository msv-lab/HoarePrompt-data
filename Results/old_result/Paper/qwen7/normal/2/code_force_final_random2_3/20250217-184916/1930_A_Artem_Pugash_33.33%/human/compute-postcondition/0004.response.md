Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.sort(reverse=False)` sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order. The other variables (`numCases`, `i`, and `numInteger`) remain unchanged.
