Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` from the input using the `map` function and unpacks them into the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The values of `i`, `k`, `sums`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `k` remains a non-negative integer. The new values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are now part of the current state.
