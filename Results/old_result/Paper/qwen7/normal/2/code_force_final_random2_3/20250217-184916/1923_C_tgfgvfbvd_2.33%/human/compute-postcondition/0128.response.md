Postcondition: `c` is 0, `p` is an empty list, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is an element at index `a - 2` in list `p` and has been decreased by `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, `a` is an input integer with the current value such that `a - 2 < 0` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`, and the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is either true or false.
