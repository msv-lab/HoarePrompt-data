Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `l` is now equal to `l1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is a reference to `l2` where `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` and `l2.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l2.index(a2)`.
