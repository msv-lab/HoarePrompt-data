Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `t`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is non-zero.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k.
   - `i` is `k-1`.
   - `c` is an integer from the input split.
   - `r` is an integer from the input split.
   - `m` is `n - num`.

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero. Since the loop is `while t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

4. **Adjustment Requirement**: To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be non-zero. Given that `t` can be any integer between 0 and 10000-1, we need to ensure `t` is not zero.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be non-zero**
