Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The states of the other variables are not affected.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will eventually become false, meaning `R` and `L` converge to the same value, which is 50001 in this case. At this point, the loop terminates. The value of `x` will be the last computed midpoint, which is also 50001. Since the loop exits when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, it means the final decision is based on whether `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`). Given the conditions provided, if the loop exits with `R` set to 50001, it implies that the final value of `x` (which is 50001) satisfies the condition for `R` to be updated to `x`, indicating that `numCuts` is likely equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` at this point.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 0, `x` is a value determined by the final calculation of `(L + R) // 2` where `L` and `R` are the values they take after the last iteration of the loop, `adj` is a bidirectional adjacency list with `n` nodes, `L` is the final left boundary value, `R` is the final right boundary value, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `x` will be the midpoint of the current range defined by `L` and `R`, which are adjusted in each iteration based on the conditions given. Since `numCuts` is not incremented within the loop and is initially 0, it will remain 0. The `dfs(1, 1)` function call returns `leftover`, which remains unchanged unless the loop modifies `L` or `R` in a way that affects the outcome of `dfs(1, 1)`, but since no such modification is indicated, `leftover` retains its initial value from the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes, the value of `L` and `R` converge to the same value, which is the midpoint calculated in the last iteration. Since the condition `R - L > 1` is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. The value of `x` becomes the final midpoint, and both `L` and `R` are set to this value. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain as they were in the last iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
