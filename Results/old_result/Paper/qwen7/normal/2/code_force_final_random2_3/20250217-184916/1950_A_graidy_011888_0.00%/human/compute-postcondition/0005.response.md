Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `res` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `res`. Since `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were previously defined as random integers between 1 and 9, their values remain unchanged. The new variable `res` is created and assigned an empty string value.
