You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) each ranging from 1 to 9. For each set, it determines and prints whether the sequence forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' pattern based on the values of x, y, and z. After completing 1000 iterations, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining whether three given digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither.
   - A stair is defined as \(a < b < c\).
   - A peak is defined as \(a < b > c\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program uses a `while` loop that runs 1000 times, generating random digits for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) within the range [1, 9].
   - It then checks the conditions for a peak and a stair, but the logic is incorrect.
   - The program prints the generated digits and the result (which can be 'peak', 'stair', or 'none') for each iteration.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program generates random digits and does not use the input values from the test cases.
   - The conditions for determining a peak or a stair are incorrectly implemented:
     - For a peak, it should check if \(x < y > z\), but the current logic does not correctly implement this.
     - For a stair, it should check if \(x < y < z\), but the current logic does not correctly implement this either.
   - The program prints random results rather than the results based on the input values.

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The program should take the input values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and determine whether they form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not use the input values and instead generates random digits and prints random results. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
