Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `ans` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-1`, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[i-1]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, and `nums` is a list containing these digits. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is `False`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-2`, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` becomes `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `m-3`, `m` remains greater than 1, `arr[i-1]` is updated based on the comparison of `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]`, and `ans` is `False`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, then `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last character of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, and `arr[i-1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
