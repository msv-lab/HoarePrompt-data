Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` and `b` are input integers by the user.
- `c` remains 0.
- `p` remains an empty list.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `l` remains a non-empty list.
- `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
- `a` and `b` are updated to the integers inputted by the user.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the other variables or their values, it will always print the same string regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `p`, `m`, `l`, or `s`.

Output: **YES**
