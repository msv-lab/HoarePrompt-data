Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 4 modulo MOD, `ans` is 0 modulo MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be `ans` modulo `MOD`. Given that `ans` was initially `6 modulo MOD`, after executing `ans %= MOD`, `ans` becomes `0 modulo MOD` because 6 modulo `MOD` (assuming `MOD` is greater than 6) would reduce to 0 if 6 is exactly divisible by `MOD` or less than `MOD`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
