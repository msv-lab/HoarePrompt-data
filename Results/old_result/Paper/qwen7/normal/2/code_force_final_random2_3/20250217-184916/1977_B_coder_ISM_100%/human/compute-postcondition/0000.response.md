Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), this condition is preserved. The other variables remain unchanged, and the only new information is that `t` now holds the value input by the user.
