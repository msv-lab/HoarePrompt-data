### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a single row of the river grid.
   - It ensures that the first \( d-1 \) elements of the row are incremented by 1.
   - For the remaining elements, it sets each to the minimum value of the previous \( d \) elements plus 1.
   - The function returns the last element of the processed row, which represents the cost of installing supports for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire grid.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of supports for each row.
   - It then calculates the cost of building \( k \) consecutive bridges by summing the costs of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost among all possible sets of \( k \) consecutive bridges.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints for each row.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes the grid and finds the minimum cost for building \( k \) bridges.

Given the detailed explanation and the logical flow of the functions, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
