Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an empty list, length is 30
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30. If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, then the first element of `s` is set to '1'. Otherwise, the first element of `s` is set to '0', and all other elements remain as empty elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of length 31 where the last element is either '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of length 32 where the last element is '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false, and the 2nd element of `s` is updated accordingly. If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, the last element of `s` is '1'. Otherwise, `s` has an additional '0' appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
