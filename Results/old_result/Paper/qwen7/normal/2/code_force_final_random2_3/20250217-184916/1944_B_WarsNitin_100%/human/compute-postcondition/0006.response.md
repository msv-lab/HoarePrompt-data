Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code sorts the sublist `b`, which contains the first `n` elements of the list `a`. The sorting operation changes the order of elements in `b` but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `c`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `b` now contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order.
