Output State: The list `b` will contain all elements from the list `a` based on the instructions given by the string `s`. Specifically, for each 'L' in `s`, the corresponding element from `a` starting from index `l` (which starts at 0) will be appended to `b` and `l` will be incremented. For each 'R' in `s`, the corresponding element from `a` starting from index `r` (which starts at `n - 1`) will be appended to `b` and `r` will be decremented. After the loop completes, `b` will contain exactly `n` elements, and `l` will be equal to `n`, while `r` will be equal to `-1`.

In simpler terms, the final list `b` will be constructed by following the directions in string `s`, picking elements from the beginning or end of list `a` accordingly, until all elements of `a` are used, and both `l` and `r` will reflect their final positions after processing all elements of `s`.
