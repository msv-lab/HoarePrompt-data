Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The values of `cn2`, `j`, and `sum_f` remain unchanged from their initial state.
