Output State: **The value of `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each element `ele` in the list `lst`. Since the loop processes every element in `lst`, `mini` will end up being the overall minimum difference. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst`) remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
