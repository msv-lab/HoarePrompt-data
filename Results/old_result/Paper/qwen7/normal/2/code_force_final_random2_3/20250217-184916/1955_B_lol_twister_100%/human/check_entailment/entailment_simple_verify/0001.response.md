### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `c`, and `d` of the progressive square.
- It also reads the array `l` of length `n^2`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the given array `l` can form a progressive square with the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.
- It calculates the minimum value `a` in the array `l`.
- It then generates the expected progressive square values using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all positions `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
- Both the generated list `li` and the input array `l` are sorted.
- Finally, it checks if the sorted lists match and returns 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

#### Correctness of the Logic:
- The logic for generating the progressive square values is correct. The formula `a + k * c + d * h` ensures that each element in the matrix is uniquely determined by its position `(k, h)`.
- Sorting both lists before comparison is necessary because the input array `l` may contain the elements in any order.
- The function correctly identifies whether the input array can form the required progressive square.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the input constraints appropriately.
- The function works correctly for all given examples in the problem statement.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the function `func_1`. Specifically, the way the list `li` is populated can lead to incorrect results due to the way the nested loops are structured. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Nested Loops Structure:**
   ```python
   for k in range(0, n):
       for h in range(0, n):
           li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
   ```
   This structure generates the progressive square values in a row-major order, meaning the first `n` elements correspond to the first row, the next `n` elements to the second row, and so on. However, the input array `l` could have elements in any order, which means the sorted `li` might not match the sorted `l` even if they represent the same progressive square.

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     - `n = 3`, `c = 2`, `d = 3`
     - `l = [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8]`
   - The correct progressive square would be:
     ```
     3  9  6
     5  7  1
     10 4  8
     ```
   - The function generates the list `li` in row-major order:
     ```python
     li = [3, 5, 10, 9, 7, 4, 6, 1, 8]
     ```
   - When sorted, `li` becomes:
     ```python
     li_sorted = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10]
     ```
   - The input array `l` is already sorted:
     ```python
     l_sorted = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10]
     ```
   - In this case, the sorted lists match, but this is a coincidence. If the input array `l` were shuffled differently, the sorted lists might not match.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation of the function `func_1` does not account for the possibility that the input array `l` might not be in the correct order to form the progressive square.
   - The function fails to correctly handle cases where the input array `l` is not in the correct order.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly handle all possible input orders and may return incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
