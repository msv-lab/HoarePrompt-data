Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` remains `t`, `n` is the total number of unique integers entered (plus one), `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list except for the entries that contain the connections between the nodes as specified by the input, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `L`, `i`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, and `R` remain unchanged from their initial states.
