You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

For each index `i` from 2 to `n-1`, the value of `dp[i]` will be determined based on the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically, if `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` will be `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` will be the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or plus 0 if `path[i]` is '*'. All other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The problem describes a scenario involving the occurrence of signs of the apocalypse at specific intervals, and the code seems to be dealing with a different problem related to paths and dynamic programming.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to process a string where '@' represents a valid state and '*' represents an invalid state. It calculates the maximum number of valid states using dynamic programming, but this logic is completely unrelated to the problem of determining the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur.
3. The `func_2` function reads input and calls `func_1` on each test case, but again, this is not relevant to the problem at hand.
4. Since the functions provided do not implement the logic required to solve the given problem, the program is incorrect.
