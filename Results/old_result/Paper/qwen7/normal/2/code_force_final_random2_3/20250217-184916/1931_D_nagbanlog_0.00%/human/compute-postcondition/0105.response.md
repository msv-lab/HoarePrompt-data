Output State: **`case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.; `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, and `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`; `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. No other changes are made to the variables `case`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.
