Output State: **`b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is sorted, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing `[b[n-1]]` if `b[0] != b[1]`; otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[n-1]` to the list `l`. The initial state of `l` is determined by whether `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. After appending `b[n-1]`, `l` will contain `[b[n-1]]` if `b[0] != b[1]`, otherwise, it remains an empty list. All other variables retain their initial states.
