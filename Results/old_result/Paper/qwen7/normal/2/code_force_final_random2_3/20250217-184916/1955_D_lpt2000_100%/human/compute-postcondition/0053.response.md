Postcondition: **`fnd` is increased by 1, `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next pair of elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`, respectively, and `m` and `n` remain the same. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `out_aa` is reduced by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**
