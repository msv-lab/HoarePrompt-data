Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The `func_1` function is designed to process a string with special characters ('@' and '*'), which is completely unrelated to the problem of calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities. The `func_2` function reads input but does not correctly process it according to the problem requirements.

To solve the given problem, you would need to implement a function that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs. The LCM of these numbers will give the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    current_year = 1
    for period in periods:
        current_year = lcm(current_year, period)
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        periods = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution correctly addresses the problem by finding the LCM of the periodicities and determining the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
