Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` must be non-zero, meaning `cnt` is a non-zero integer.
- `l` is explicitly given as 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Here, `i` and `v` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. However, since the question asks us to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information, we can say that `i * v` will be the product of `i` and `v`.

Therefore, the output will be a string with placeholders for `l`, `i`, and `v`.

Output: **'? 1 [i * v]'**
