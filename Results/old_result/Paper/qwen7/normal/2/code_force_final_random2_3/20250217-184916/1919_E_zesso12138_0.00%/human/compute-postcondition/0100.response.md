Output State: **`new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, and `i` remains 2 * n + 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Since `j` is 2 * n + 2, `j - 1` is 2 * n + 1. The value of `new_dp[j + 1]` was already updated in the previous line of code to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, where `j + 1` is 2 * n + 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2 * n + 2. All other variables and their states remain as they were in the initial state.
