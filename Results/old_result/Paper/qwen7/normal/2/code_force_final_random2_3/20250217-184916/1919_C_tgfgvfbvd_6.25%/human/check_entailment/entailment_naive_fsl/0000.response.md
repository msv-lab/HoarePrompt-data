Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the penalty and splitting the array into subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) is flawed. Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the input:
```
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

According to the problem description, the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to have \(s = [2, 4, 5]\) and \(t = [1, 3]\), which results in a penalty of \(2 + 1 = 3\).

However, the provided program does not correctly handle this scenario. It seems to be attempting to find a way to maximize the difference between consecutive elements in the array, which is not aligned with the goal of minimizing the penalty. The program does not properly consider all possible splits of the array to find the one with the minimum penalty.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one case, making it incorrect.
