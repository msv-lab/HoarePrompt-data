Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is defined as `i_prev + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the initial state, we do not have explicit values for `mak`, `mak2`, or `i_prev`. Therefore, we need to express these values in terms of the given information.

- `i` is `i_prev + 1`, but since `i_prev` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.
- `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown.

Given this information, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`, along with the literal `'?'`.

Output: **'? ? ? i_prev + 1 ?'**
