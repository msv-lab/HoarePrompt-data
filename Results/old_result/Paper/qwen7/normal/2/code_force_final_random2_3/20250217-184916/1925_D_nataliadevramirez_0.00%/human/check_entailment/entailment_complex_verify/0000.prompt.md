You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively. All pairs of friends are distinct, and the friendship value f is a positive integer. The constant MOD is defined as \(10^9 + 7\).
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        a, b, f = friendships[i]
        
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
        
    #State: The final value of `result` is the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for all `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `n` is an integer representing the number of children, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends and must be equal to the total number of iterations of the loop, `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions, and `friendships` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively.
    return result % MOD
    #The program returns the result which is the sum of f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD for all i from 0 to m-1, where k is the number of excursions, f is the friendship value, and m is the total number of iterations of the loop as defined by the length of the friendships list. The result is then taken modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters n (the number of children), m (the number of pairs of friends), k (the number of excursions), and friendships (a list of tuples containing the indices of pairs of children who are friends and their friendship values). It calculates the sum of each friendship value multiplied by the combination of k excursions taken two at a time (k * (k + 1) // 2), modulo a constant MOD (\(10^9 + 7\)). The function returns this calculated sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively.

    #State: Output State: `t` must be equal to or greater than the total number of test cases, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), and `result` is the cumulative return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` for each test case.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will hold the final count of test cases processed, and `result` will be the combined outcome of applying `func_1` to each set of inputs provided across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), the number of excursions (k), and a list of friendships. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters to compute a result. After processing all test cases, it prints the cumulative result of `func_1` for each test case. If any input is invalid, it returns an error message.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the calculation in `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends. 

The formula used in `func_1` is:
\[ \text{result} += f \times \left(\frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}\right) \% \text{MOD} \]

This formula assumes that each pair is chosen with equal probability, which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve calculating the probability of each pair being chosen at least once and then using that to compute the expected value.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
- There are 2 children and 1 pair of friends with a friendship value of 1.
- The teacher goes on 1 excursion.
- The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of choosing the pair of friends.

The correct expected value for this case is 1, but the given program will output 0, which is incorrect.
