Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the previous one starting from index 1.**

Explanation: The code checks if each element in the list `a` (from index 1 to the end) is greater than or equal to the previous element. The result of this check is stored in the variable `check_all`, which is a boolean value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
