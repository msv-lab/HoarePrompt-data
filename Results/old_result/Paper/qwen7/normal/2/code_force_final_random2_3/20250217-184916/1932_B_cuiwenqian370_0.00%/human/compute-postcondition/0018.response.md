Output State: **`index` is 6, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 2, `n` is the sixth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the fifth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[index]`, which is the sixth element of `data`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
