You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings across all test cases are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is the total number of iterations the loop will run, which is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive. `q` ranges from 0 to `t-1` across all iterations. For each iteration, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in the input string `s`, and `bc` is the total count of characters in `s` that are not 'A'. After all iterations, if `ac` is greater than `bc` for any iteration, the condition `ac > bc` holds true for at least one iteration. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc` for all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', otherwise it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to count occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively. It iterates through each character in the string and increments the appropriate counter.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences, the program compares `ac` and `bc`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases where the string can be composed of any combination of 'A' and 'B'. It correctly identifies the more frequent character in each test case.
5. **Distinct Test Cases**: The problem statement mentions that all strings in a test are different, which the program inherently respects since it processes each test case independently.

Given these points, the program appears to be logically sound and should work correctly for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
