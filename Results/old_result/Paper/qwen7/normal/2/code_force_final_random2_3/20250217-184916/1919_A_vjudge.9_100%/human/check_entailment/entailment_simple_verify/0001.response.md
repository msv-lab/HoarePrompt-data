### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and reasoning behind the program. Let's break down the key points to confirm the correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The core logic of the program is based on the parity (even or odd) of the difference between `a` and `b`.
   - The program correctly calculates `abs(a - b)` and checks if it is even or odd.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, the program prints "Bob".
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, the program prints "Alice".

3. **Detailed Explanation:**
   - **Case when `abs(a - b)` is even:**
     - As the game progresses, the difference between `a` and `b` will always remain even because each move reduces the difference by at least 1. Since the difference starts even, it will always remain even until the last move, which will be made by Bob.
   - **Case when `abs(a - b)` is odd:**
     - Similarly, if the difference starts odd, it will always remain odd until the last move, which will be made by Alice.

4. **Implementation:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the detailed explanation.
   - It handles all test cases as expected based on the given examples.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct implementation of the logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
