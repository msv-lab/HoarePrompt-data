Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`.
4. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.
5. If the array is not sorted, it iterates through the array to find a possible split point where swapping the two parts could result in a sorted array.
6. For each potential split point `i`, it checks if the prefix `a[:i]` is greater than or equal to the suffix `a[i:]` and if the suffix `a[i:]` is sorted.
7. If such a split point is found, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
8. If no such split point is found, it prints 'NO'.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
