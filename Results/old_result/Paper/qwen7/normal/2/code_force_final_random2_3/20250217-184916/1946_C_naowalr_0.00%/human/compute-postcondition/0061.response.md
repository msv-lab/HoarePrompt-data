Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `adj[b]` now includes `a`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-2`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be `n-2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`.
   - Since `i` is set to `n-1` at the start of each iteration, and it needs to be decremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` should be `n-2`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `a` and `b` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.
   - `adj[b]` includes `a`, and this information remains the same for the next iteration.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `a` remains the same (integer equal to the second number input from stdin).
   - `b` remains the same (integer equal to the first number input from stdin).
   - `adj[b]` still includes `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`a` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `i` is `n-2`, and `adj[b]` includes `a`**.
