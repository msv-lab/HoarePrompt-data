Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables `x` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n`. This means `x` starts from `y + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is the current index being processed.
   - `n` is the upper bound of the loop.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `x` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `x` will be `x + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `x` must be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is such that `x + 1` is within the range `[y + 1, n)`.
- `n` must be greater than `x + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `x` is `x + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than `x + 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`**
