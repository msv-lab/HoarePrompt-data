Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and passes it to the function `func_1`.
2. In `func_1`, the program constructs a frequency dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
3. After processing all stick lengths, the program calculates the total number of regular polygons that can be formed. Since each polygon requires 4 sides, the program sums up the integer division of each frequency by 4.
4. The logic in `func_1` is sound and matches the problem requirements. It correctly counts the number of complete polygons (each requiring 4 sides) that can be formed from the given stick lengths.
5. Given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), the program should handle all valid inputs correctly without errors or logical flaws.

Correctness: **True**
