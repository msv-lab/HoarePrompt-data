Output State: **`ii` is 1, `i` is 7, `n` is an input integer followed by another integer (separated by space), `k` is an input integer, `r` is `a[7]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 3`, `a` is a list of two integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The length of `a` is 2 because only two integers are expected. The other variables (`ii`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
