Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is at least 5, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` is 4, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, and a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.**

The code initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to -1. This does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables or the new string input. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `idx1` and `idx2`.
