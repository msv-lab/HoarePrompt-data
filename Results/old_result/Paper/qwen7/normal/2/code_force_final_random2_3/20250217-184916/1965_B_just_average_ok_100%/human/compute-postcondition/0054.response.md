Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part. This means the loop will run based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 20, `idx` is 20, and `nums` is a list with specific elements excluding 1048576.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as the input value (let's call it `k`) is greater than 0. After each iteration, `i` and `idx` are both incremented by 1.

4. **Calculate the new values**:
   - Since `i` and `idx` are both 20 at the end of the previous iteration, they will both be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` and `idx` will both become 21.
   - The value of `k` (input) must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. However, since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only say that `k` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` becomes 21.
   - `idx` becomes 21.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.

Given these steps, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 21, `k` must be greater than 0**
