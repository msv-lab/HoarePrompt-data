### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum number of points you can get, given that Nene will always play optimally to minimize your score while maximizing hers.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input (stdin).
   - It processes every second line (starting from the third line) of the input.
   - For each line, it counts the occurrences of each unique element and calculates the sum of the integer division of these counts by 3.

3. **Issues with the Provided Code**:
   - The logic in the code does not match the problem requirements.
   - The code is trying to count how many times each unique element appears and then dividing by 3, which is irrelevant to the problem.
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, you need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players.
   - You should keep track of the cards on the table and the cards in your hand.
   - For each of your turns, you should choose a card that maximizes your score while minimizing Nene's potential score.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
