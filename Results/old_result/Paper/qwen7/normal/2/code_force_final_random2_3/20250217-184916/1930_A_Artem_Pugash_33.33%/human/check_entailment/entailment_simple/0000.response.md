Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `numInteger` (which is `n`), and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates the minimum of these two elements, adds this minimum to the cumulative score (`suma`), and continues until the list is empty.
5. The final score (`suma`) is printed for each test case.
6. The state description at the end of the program accurately reflects the state after processing all test cases: `numCases` equals the number of test cases processed, `i` equals `numCases`, `numbers` is an empty list, and `suma` holds the correct cumulative score.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct and matches the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
