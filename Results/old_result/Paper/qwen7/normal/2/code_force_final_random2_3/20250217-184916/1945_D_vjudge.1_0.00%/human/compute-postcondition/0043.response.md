Output State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k + 2] + lista_B[i]`, `pref` remains the same, `resultado` is updated to `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially `n - k + 1`, the new value of `soma_b` becomes the original `soma_b` plus `lista_B[n - k + 2]` (as mentioned in the initial state) plus `lista_B[i]`. All other variables (`pref` and `resultado`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
