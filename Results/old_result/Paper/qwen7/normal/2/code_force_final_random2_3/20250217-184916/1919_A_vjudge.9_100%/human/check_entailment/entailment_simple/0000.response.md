Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on the parity (even or odd) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
2. The provided solution checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd using `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
3. If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Alice".
4. This logic correctly determines the winner based on the game rules provided:
   - If the absolute difference is even, Bob will always win because he can always force the game into a state where the absolute difference becomes odd, making Alice lose.
   - If the absolute difference is odd, Alice will always win because she can always force the game into a state where the absolute difference becomes even, making Bob lose.
5. The solution handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating through each test case and applying the same logic.

Correctness: **True**
