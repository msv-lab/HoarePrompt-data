### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations, where the cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the shifted substring.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads an integer `n` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It initializes two counters `cnt` for zeros and ones and a variable `ans` to store the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the counters and the cost.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the counts of zeros and ones in the string `s`. Specifically, `ans` is computed as the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1. The function prints `ans` for each test case and does not return any value.

4. **Key Issues**:
   - The code reads the binary string as a list of integers, but it should be read as a string to correctly handle the cyclic shifts.
   - The logic to calculate the cost is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts and their costs.
   - The approach to finding the minimum cost is not accurate. The given code does not implement the correct algorithm to find the minimum cost.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify the positions where we need to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - We can use a more complex algorithm that identifies the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed and calculates their costs.

6. **Evaluation Based on Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that `ans` is calculated as the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1. This is not the correct approach for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.
   - The function summary does not align with the problem requirements, as it does not describe how to correctly compute the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the function summary does not accurately describe the correct approach to solving the problem, and the provided code does not correctly implement the solution, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct algorithm to find the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the binary string.
