Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 28, `u` is `x` >> 28 & 1, `v` is the sum of [(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a], `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` remains unchanged and is currently `False`, `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the first element of `a` with `val`, and `ai` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` is now `val >> i & 1` (where `i` is the current index during the iteration), and `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with `val`, and `ai` is 0. If `op` is `False`, the values of `a`, `op`, `t`, and `ai` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with the next `val`. `op` is now the XOR of the original `op` with `val >> i & 1`. `t` is a list with one additional element which is the result of `ai ^ val`. If `op` is `0`, `t` has an additional element appended which is the result of `ai ^ val`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
