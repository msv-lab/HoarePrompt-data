Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine Initial Values:**
   - `i` is set to `n` initially.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop will run as long as `1 <= i < n - 1`.

4. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   Given that `i` is initially set to `n`, let's check if this value satisfies the loop condition `1 <= i < n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - Since `i` is initially `n`, it does not satisfy the condition `1 <= i < n - 1` unless `n` is less than 3.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be within the range `1` to `n-2`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to a value within this range, and `n` should be adjusted to ensure `i` falls within the valid range.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the initial values of `i` and `n` such that `1 <= i < n - 1`.

### Final State:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2**

This ensures that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.
