Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is now [26] (previously it was either [1] or a list containing 26), `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than or equal to 52, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` could either be [1] or a list containing 26. After appending 26, `arr` will be [26]. All other variables remain unchanged.
