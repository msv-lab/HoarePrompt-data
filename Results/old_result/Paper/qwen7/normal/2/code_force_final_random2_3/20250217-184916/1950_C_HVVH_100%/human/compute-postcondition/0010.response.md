Output State: **`day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer greater than 12 minus 12, `m` is an input integer, and `h` is not equal to 0**.

The code changes the value of `day` to 'PM', but keeps all other conditions and values of the variables intact. Therefore, the output state maintains the same conditions for `n`, `h`, and `m`, while updating `day` to 'PM'.
