Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise AND with 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The operation on `op` remains unchanged in terms of its description, as the code only increments `cnt`. The initial postcondition for `op` is preserved, meaning `op` is updated by performing the specified bitwise operation with `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise AND with 1.
