Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 0, `char` is '(', balance is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `balance` is incremented by 1. Since `char` is the first character of `s` and its initial value is '(', `balance` starts at 0 and is then incremented to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
