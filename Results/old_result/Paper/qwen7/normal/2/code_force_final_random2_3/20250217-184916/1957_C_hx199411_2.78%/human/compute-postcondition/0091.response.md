Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` exceeds `m`. After all iterations, `i` will be `m + 1`, and `dp` will be a list of length `m + 2` (since `dp` is indexed from 0 to `m + 1`). Each element in `dp` from `dp[0]` to `dp[m + 1]` will be updated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, with the final value of `dp[m + 1]` being the result of the last update.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `dp` list will contain updated values based on the given formula, starting from `dp[0]` up to `dp[m + 1]`, with all calculations performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
