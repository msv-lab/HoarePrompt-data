Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
