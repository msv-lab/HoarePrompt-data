Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`; `v` is 1.**

In this scenario, the code initializes `v` to 1. Since `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `v` along with the unchanged values of `n` and `k`.
