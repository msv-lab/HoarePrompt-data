Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)' and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is replaced by `curr_v`.**

This means that the value of `permutation` at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been updated to `curr_v`, while the conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
