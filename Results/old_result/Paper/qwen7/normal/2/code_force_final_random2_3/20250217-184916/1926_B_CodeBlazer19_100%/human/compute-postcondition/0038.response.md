Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0.
- `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is equal to `n-1`.
- `s` holds the last input string provided.

The key point here is that the current value of `a` is not 0. This means that during the loop iterations, at least one of the strings `s` must have contained exactly one '1'.

Given this information, the value of `a` is 'TRIANGLE'.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
