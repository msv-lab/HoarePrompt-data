The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \), along with a graph represented by edges between nodes. It determines the minimum value \( L \) such that the graph can be cut into at most \( k \) connected components, with each component having at least \( L \) nodes. The function reads input from standard input, constructs the graph, and uses a binary search approach combined with a depth-first search (DFS) to find the value of \( L \). After processing all test cases, it prints the value of \( L \) for each case.
