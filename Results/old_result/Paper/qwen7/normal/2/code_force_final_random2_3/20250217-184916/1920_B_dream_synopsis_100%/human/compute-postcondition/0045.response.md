Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop.
- `ans` will be a list containing `k+1` elements.

The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value among the elements in the list `ans`.

Since `ans` is a list containing `k+1` elements and the exact values of these elements are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements in `ans`.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list containing k+1 elements)**
