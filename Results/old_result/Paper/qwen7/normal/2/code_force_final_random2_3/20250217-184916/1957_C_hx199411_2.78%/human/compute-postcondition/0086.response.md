Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `k` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. However, since the initial values of `dp`, `i`, `k`, and `m` are not specified, we only know that `k` and `m` must be at least 3. The values of `dp[i]`, `dp[i - 1]`, and `dp[i - 2]` are calculated based on their respective previous values, but their exact values are not known. The modulo operation ensures that the result does not exceed \(10^9 + 7\).
