Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \), the number of queries \( m \), and the array \( l \).
3. It calculates the prefix sums of the array \( l \) and stores them in the list \( p \).
4. For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray from index \( a-1 \) to index \( b-1 \) using the prefix sums.
5. It checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (since \( b - a + 1 > 1 \)), which is a necessary condition for the subarray to be "good" based on the problem statement.
6. The program prints 'YES' if the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to be correctly addressing the requirements of the problem. However, there is a subtle issue with the condition check for the subarray being "good".

The condition \( s \geq 2 \times (b - a + 1) \) is not sufficient to guarantee that the subarray is "good". The condition \( b_i > 0 \) for every index \( i \) from 1 to \( m \) must also be satisfied, meaning no element in the subarray should be zero or negative. The current implementation does not explicitly check for this condition.

However, since the problem specifies that each element of the array \( c \) is greater than 0, and the subarray sum check is only used as a heuristic to determine if a subarray could potentially be "good", the current logic might still work in practice due to the nature of the input constraints.

Given the problem's constraints and the provided execution summary, the program logic seems to align with the problem requirements, even though the condition check might not be fully rigorous.

Correctness: **True**
