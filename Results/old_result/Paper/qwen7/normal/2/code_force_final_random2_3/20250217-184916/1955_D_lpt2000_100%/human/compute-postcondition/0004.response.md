Output State: **`nabors` is a list of strings converted from the input split by spaces, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `bb` is a list of strings converted from another input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `bb` by taking another input from the user, splitting it by spaces, and converting each element to a string. The original values of `nabors`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
