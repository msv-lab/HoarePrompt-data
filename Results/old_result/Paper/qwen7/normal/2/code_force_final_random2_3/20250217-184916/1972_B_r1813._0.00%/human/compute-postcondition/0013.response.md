Output State: **`index` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[3]`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing 'YES', `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s` and it is odd.**

The code `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
