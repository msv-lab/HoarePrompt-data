The function reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` inputs. For each input, it checks a string `arr` containing only '0's and '1's. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and these '1's are adjacent, it appends 'no' to the `results` list; otherwise, it appends 'yes'. After processing all inputs, it prints 'no' repeated `t` times. The final state of the program includes the `results` list containing 'no' repeated `t` times, and the variables `start`, `end`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` reflecting their state after the last iteration of the loop.
