Output State: `i` is 20, `idx` is 19, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the entire list `nums`. Since the list has 21 elements (from index 0 to 20), the loop will execute 21 times. The condition `if nums[i] > k:` checks each element in the list. If the condition is met, it sets `idx = i - 1` and breaks out of the loop. Without any specific value for `k` given, the loop will continue until the end of the list. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 20 (the last index of the list), `idx` will be 19 (since `idx = i - 1` when the condition is met), and the other variables (`nums`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
