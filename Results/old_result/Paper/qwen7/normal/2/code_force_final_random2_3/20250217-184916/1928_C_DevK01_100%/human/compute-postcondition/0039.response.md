Output State: `i` will be `w + 1`, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer, and `M` will contain all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `w + 1`. During each iteration, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` itself or `q // i` is added to the list `M`. Since the loop processes all divisors of `q` up to `w`, `M` will include all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.
