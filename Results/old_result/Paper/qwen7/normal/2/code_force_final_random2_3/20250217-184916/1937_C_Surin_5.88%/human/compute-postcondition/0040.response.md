Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be at least 2.
- `r` is the string '>'.
- `prev` is equal to `i`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the values of `i` and `prev`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - Also, `prev` is equal to `i`, so `prev` is also equal to `n`.

2. **Identify the value of `v1`:**
   - The variable `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since it is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will keep it as `v1` in the output.

3. **Substitute the values into the print statement:**
   - The print statement is `f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}'`.
   - Substituting the values, we get `f'? {v1} n {v1} n'`.

Given this reasoning, the output will be:
Output: **? v1 n v1 n**
