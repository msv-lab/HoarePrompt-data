Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.**

Explanation: The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `bigList` was already described as a list with the last element removed, its state remains unchanged. The last element of `bigList` is still equal to the last element of the original `smallList`, which is now the second-to-last element of the modified `smallList`.
