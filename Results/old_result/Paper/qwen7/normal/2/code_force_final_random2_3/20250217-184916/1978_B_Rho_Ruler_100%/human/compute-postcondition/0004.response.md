Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is (0 + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `profit_mid` using the function `func_1` with arguments `mid`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. The function call `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` returns a value, which is stored in `profit_mid`.
