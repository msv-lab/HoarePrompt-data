Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `a` must contain at least one element.
- `op` is some initial value.
- `val` is an element from the list `a`.

### Loop Head
```
for val in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `val` was one of the elements in `a`.
- Since `a` must contain at least one element, the loop can continue as long as there are more elements in `a`.

### Adjusting States
- The only variable in the loop head is `val`, but it changes with each iteration.
- The other variables `a` and `op` remain unchanged within the loop head.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element.
- `val` will be the next element in the list `a`.

### Updated State
- `a` must still contain at least one element.
- `op` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `val` will be the next element in the list `a`.

### Final Answer
State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `op` is its current value, `val` is the next element in the list `a`**
