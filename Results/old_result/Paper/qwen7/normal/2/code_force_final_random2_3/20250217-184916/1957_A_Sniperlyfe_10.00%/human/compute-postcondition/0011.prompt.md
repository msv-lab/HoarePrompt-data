You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, and 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `arr` list is now empty, and for every integer `n` that was originally in `arr`, the value `freq[n]` represents the frequency of that integer in the original list `arr`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `arr` list will be empty because each element has been processed exactly once. The `freq` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the original `arr` list as a key, and the corresponding value will be the count of how many times that integer appeared in the original list.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where each frequency is the count of occurrences of a unique integer from the original `arr` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. For each unique integer in the list, the function calculates the integer division of its frequency by 4 and returns the sum of these results.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where each frequency is the count of occurrences of a unique integer from the original `arr` list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
