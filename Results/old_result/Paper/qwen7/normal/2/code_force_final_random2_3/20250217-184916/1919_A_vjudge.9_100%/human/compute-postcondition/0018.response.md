Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since the value of `i` itself is not specified, it doesn't affect the output of the `print` statement.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains either even or odd.
- `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **'Bob'**
