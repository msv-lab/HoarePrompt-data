Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is an input string from the user.**

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `r`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
