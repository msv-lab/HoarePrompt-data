Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
