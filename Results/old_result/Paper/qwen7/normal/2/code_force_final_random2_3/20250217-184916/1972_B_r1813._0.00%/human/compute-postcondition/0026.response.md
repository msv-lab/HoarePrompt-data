Output State: **`index` is 8, `t` is 0, `n` is data[8], `s` is a string of length data[8] containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list with 'NO' appended, `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
