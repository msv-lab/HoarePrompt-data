Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the final input string provided.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `i` remains 1 since it was not altered in the loop. The variable `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any input string contained exactly one '1' at any point during the loop's execution; otherwise, it remains 0. The variable `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any input string contained more than one '1' at any point during the loop's execution. The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially provided. The variable `j` is `n-1` because `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. The variable `s` holds the last input string provided after all iterations of the loop have completed.
