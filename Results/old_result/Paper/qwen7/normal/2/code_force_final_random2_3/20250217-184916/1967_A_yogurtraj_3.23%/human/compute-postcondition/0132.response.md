Output State: `i` is `n`, `r` is `a[n-1]`, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`. The variable `r` will be set to the last element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`) because the loop increments `i` until it breaks or the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met, but since `i` reaches `n - 1` without breaking, `r` will be updated to `a[n-1]`. The variable `k` will be reduced to 0 as the loop continues to subtract `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from `k` until it can no longer do so. The variables `rem` and `y` are not affected by the loop and remain 0.
