You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n.
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 0, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`, `t` is false, `a` must have at least 6 elements, `b` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x)]`, `v` is `y - x`, `b[-2]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[-1]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[2]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[3]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[4]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `u` is false.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be reduced to `false` because it is decremented until it reaches zero. The variable `u` will also be `false` as it is decremented to zero after the inner loop completes. The values of `c` and `d` will be the last values returned by the function `r()` during the final iteration of the outer loop. The variables `total`, `a`, `b`, and `v` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The list `b` will contain the values `[0, 0, 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x)]`, where `y - x` is the difference between consecutive elements in the tuple `a` from the previous iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined set of inputs: an integer t, an integer n, a list a of n integers, and an integer m. Each of the m queries consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i. The function returns different values based on the queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
