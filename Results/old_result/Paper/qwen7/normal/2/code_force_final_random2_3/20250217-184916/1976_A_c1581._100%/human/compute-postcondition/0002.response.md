Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each character in the `password` string. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `char`, which is the current character being processed in each iteration, and `password`, which is the string being iterated over.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `password` is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
   - `digits` is an empty list.
   - `letters` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each character in `password`.
   - In each iteration, `char` will take the value of the current character in `password`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will process each character in `password`, `char` will take on the value of each character in `password` during each iteration.
   - The initial state of `digits` and `letters` does not affect the loop's ability to execute, as they are not used within the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial state of `password` and the variable `char` (which will take on the value of each character in `password`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`password` is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, `char` is the first character in `password`**
