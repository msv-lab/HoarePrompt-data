Postcondition: `ans` is 2 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `1 + (zeroes - 1)`. `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `cnt` is either `[2, 0]` or `[2, 1]`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
