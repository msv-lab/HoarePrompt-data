Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.
   
3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If true, it returns 1. This check is unnecessary because we can handle this directly within the loop logic.
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the count of deletions.
   - It uses two while loops to remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string `s`:
     - For "map": It finds the first occurrence of "map" and removes it by slicing the string before and after "map", then increments `ans` by 1.
     - For "pie": It finds the first occurrence of "pie" and removes it similarly, then increments `ans` by 1.
   - The function continues these operations until no more "map" or "pie" substrings are found in `s`.

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The function correctly handles the removal of multiple instances of "map" and "pie".
   - However, the function does not handle the case where both "map" and "pie" appear simultaneously in the string. In such cases, it would only remove one of them per iteration, potentially leaving the other substring intact.
   - For example, consider the string "mappie". The function would remove "map" first, resulting in "pie", but it should ideally remove "pie" next to make the string beautiful with zero deletions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation is not sufficient to ensure that the string becomes beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
