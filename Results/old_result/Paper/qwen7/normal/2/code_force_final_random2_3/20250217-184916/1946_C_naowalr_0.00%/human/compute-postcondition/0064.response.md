Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `i` is `n-2`, and `adj[b]` includes `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Since `adj[a]` previously included `b`, the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and the condition about `adj[a]` remain unchanged. The only change is that `a` is now also included in `adj[b]`.
