Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code splits the input string (which is expected to be in the format of hours and minutes separated by a colon) into two integers using `map(int, input().split(':'))`. These integers are then assigned to the variables `h` and `m`. The `day` and `n` variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
