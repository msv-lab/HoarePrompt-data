Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `case['params']` retains its original value, `results` retains its original value, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1, `mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. All other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the `required_mod_y` variable now holds the same value as `mod_y`, but the description of the output state keeps the original wording for clarity.
