Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is either an empty list or a list containing 0 and sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`. Additionally, if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains those elements; otherwise, `final` now contains the integer `n`.
