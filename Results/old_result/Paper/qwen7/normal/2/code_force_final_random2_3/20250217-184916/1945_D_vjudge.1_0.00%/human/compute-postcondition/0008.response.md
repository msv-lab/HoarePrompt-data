Output State: `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.

Explanation: Since the loop runs `numero_testes` times and `func_1()` is called in each iteration, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times. The value of `numero_testes` remains within the range \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4\) as no operations inside or outside the loop change its value.
