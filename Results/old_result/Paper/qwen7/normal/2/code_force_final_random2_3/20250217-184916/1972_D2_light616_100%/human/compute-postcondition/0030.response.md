Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is given by `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is 2
   - `y` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 5
   - `m` must be at least 30
   - `cnt` is 1 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition)

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

4. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - Substitute the current values into the loop condition:
     - `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
     - `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
   - Check if these values satisfy the conditions:
     - `8 <= n` (since `n` must be at least 5, this condition is satisfied)
     - `8 <= m` (since `m` must be at least 30, this condition is satisfied)

Since both conditions are already satisfied, the loop will continue to execute as long as the values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` remain within the specified constraints.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop condition is already met, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop executes again. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` must still meet their respective constraints.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the same as the ones provided in the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 30**
