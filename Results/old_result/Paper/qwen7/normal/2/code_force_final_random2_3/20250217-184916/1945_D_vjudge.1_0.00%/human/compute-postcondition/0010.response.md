Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads `numero_testes`, `n`, `m`, list `a`, and list `b`. It then calls `func_1()` exactly `numero_testes` times, performing unspecified operations defined in `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but ensures that `func_1()` has been called the required number of times.**
