Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`.
- `prev` is the value of `x` from the current iteration.
- `idx` is decremented by 1.
- If `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`; otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for x in odds:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `x` is taken from the list `odds`.
- The loop does not directly modify `odds`, `prev`, or `idx` within its body. Instead, it uses these variables to update the array `a`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
- Since `x` is taken from `odds`, `odds` itself is not modified by the loop. Therefore, `odds` remains the same.
- `prev` is the value of `x` from the current iteration, so for the next iteration, `prev` will be the current value of `x`.
- `idx` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `idx` will be `idx - 1`.

### Conditions to Check:
- If `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`.
- Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.

Since `idx` is decremented by 1, for the next iteration:
- If `idx` was equal to `n - 1 - idx` in the previous iteration, it will no longer be equal in the next iteration.
- Therefore, the condition `if idx == n - 1 - idx` will not hold true for the next iteration.

### New State:
- `odds` remains the same.
- `prev` becomes the current value of `x` from the previous iteration.
- `idx` is decremented by 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, `idx` is `idx - 1`**.
