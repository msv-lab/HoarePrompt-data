Based on the initial state, `s2` is a string obtained by shifting all characters of `s` one position to the left, with the first character of `s` wrapping around to the end of `s2`.

Let's break it down:

1. Suppose `s` is a string, say "hello".
2. Shifting all characters of `s` one position to the left would result in "elloh", where the first character 'h' wraps around to the end of the string.
3. Therefore, `s2` would be "elloh".

Given this, when the print statement `print(s2)` is executed, it will print the string "elloh".

Output: **elloh**
