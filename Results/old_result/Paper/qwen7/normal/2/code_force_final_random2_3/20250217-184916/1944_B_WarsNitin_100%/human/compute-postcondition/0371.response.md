Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then determines and returns pairs of integers that match based on the given conditions (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4, and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋).**

This means the function takes an array of 2n integers as input, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and returns pairs of integers that match according to the specified constraints.
