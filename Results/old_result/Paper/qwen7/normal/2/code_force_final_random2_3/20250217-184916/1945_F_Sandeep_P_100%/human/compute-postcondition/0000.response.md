Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of integers where each element represents the magic power of a mushroom, and p is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is a docstring for a decorator function and does not actually modify the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
