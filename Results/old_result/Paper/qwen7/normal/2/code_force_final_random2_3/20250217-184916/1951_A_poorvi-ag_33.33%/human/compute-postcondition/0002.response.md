Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: 
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter and starts from 0.
   - The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `start` and `end` are not directly involved in the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` should start at 0 before the loop begins.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
