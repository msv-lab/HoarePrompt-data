Output State: **`combined` is sorted based on the second element of each tuple; `heap` is an empty list; `max_profit` is 0; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `prices` is a list generated by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the return value of `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is 0.**

The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple. The sorting does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.
