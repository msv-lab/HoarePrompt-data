Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, and m, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each test case, n and m are integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6 inclusive. The function returns a result based on the sum of n and m across all test cases, ensuring this sum does not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
