Postcondition: `i` is either `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is `ol`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and after the if-else block executes, `ans[i]` is calculated as follows:
- If `zr <= ol`, then `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- Otherwise, `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.
