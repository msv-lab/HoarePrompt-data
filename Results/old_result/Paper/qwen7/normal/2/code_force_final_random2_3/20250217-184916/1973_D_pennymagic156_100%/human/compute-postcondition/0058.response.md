Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `cnt` and `l`.

4. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
     - `cnt` must be truthy (non-zero).
     - `l < n + 1` must be true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `cnt` is currently `k - 2`, for it to be truthy, `k - 2` must be non-zero. This means `k` must be greater than 2.
   - For `l < n + 1` to be true, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`. Therefore, `func_2()` must return a value less than `n`.

6. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that `k` is greater than 2 and `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`cnt` is `k - 2` where `k` must be greater than 2, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` must return a value less than `n`**
