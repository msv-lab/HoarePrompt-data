Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`.
   - `b` is a list.

4. **Postcondition based on the character at index `i`**:
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[l]` where `l` is incremented by 1.
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[r-1]`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The postcondition for the next iteration depends on the character at the new index `i`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s` (i.e., `i + 1`), and `b` is a list. If the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[l]` where `l` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[r-1]`.**
