Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Cost**: The program calculates `ans` as the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1. This calculation does not reflect the minimum cost required to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

2. **Misunderstanding of Cyclic Shifts**: The program does not implement the logic to find the minimum cost of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string. Instead, it simply counts zeros and ones and performs a straightforward arithmetic operation, which is not related to the actual problem requirements.

3. **Logic for Finding Minimum Cost**: To solve the problem correctly, one would need to identify the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculate the cost based on the positions of the out-of-order elements. The program does not implement this logic.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
