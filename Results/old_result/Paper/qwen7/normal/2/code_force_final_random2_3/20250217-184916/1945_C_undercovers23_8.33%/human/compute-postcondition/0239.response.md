Output State: **`final` contains all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, and `final` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final`. The content of `final` remains the same as before the sort, which includes all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`. After sorting, `final` is ordered.
