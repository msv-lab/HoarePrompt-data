Output State: **`ai` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each element has been modified by `val`, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, and `t` is a list containing the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The line `ai = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ai`. No other changes are made to the variables `a`, `op`, or `t`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged from their initial state.
