Postcondition: **`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, all elements are 0 except for `new_dp[j + 1]` which is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. If `j - 1 >= 0`, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is also updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. `i` is 2 * n + 2, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`, and there exists at least one `j` such that `dp[j] > 0`. The current value of `j` is 2 * n + 2.**

Explanation: The if condition checks if `j + 1` is within the bounds of the list `new_dp`. If true, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition, ensuring that the conditions specified in the precondition are still met after the if statement executes.
