Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the smaller value between `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= s` subtracts the value of `s` from `k`. Here, `s` is defined as the smaller value between `m` and `k`. After executing this line, the value of `k` is updated to `k - s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
