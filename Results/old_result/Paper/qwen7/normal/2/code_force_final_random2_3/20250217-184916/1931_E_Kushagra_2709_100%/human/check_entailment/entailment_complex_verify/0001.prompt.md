You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each a_i in nums.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `2 * (len(cntvals) // 2)`, `tot` is decreased by the sum of every second element in `cntvals` starting from the first element, and `len(cntvals)` must be greater than or equal to `2 * (len(cntvals) // 2)`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be twice the number of elements in `cntvals` divided by 2 (which is essentially the number of elements in `cntvals` if `len(cntvals)` is even, or one less than that if it's odd). The variable `tot` will have been reduced by the sum of every second value in the `cntvals` list, starting with the first value. This process continues until there are no more pairs of elements left in `cntvals`.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the value of `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, representing the number of integers in the list; `m`, determining when Sasha wins; and `nums`, a list of integers. It calculates the total length of the string representations of all numbers in `nums`, sorts a count of zeros in each number in descending order, and then subtracts every second element from this sorted list starting from the first element. Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the resulting total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, representing an element in the list provided to Anna.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is 0, `tot` is the length of `num`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it encounters a character in `num` that is not '0'. Since the loop increments `tot` each time it iterates without breaking, `tot` will count the number of trailing zeros in `num`. Once `i` reaches 0 (meaning there are no more characters left to check), the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, and `tot` will be equal to the total number of trailing zeros in `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the total number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive and returns the total number of trailing zeros in its string representation.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Players take turns.
   - Anna reverses the digits of an element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements and removes one.
   - The game ends when only one element remains, and Sasha wins if it is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game's outcome depends on the length of the remaining numbers.
   - Sasha wins if the last remaining number has a length of at least \(m+1\) (since \(10^m\) has \(m+1\) digits).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates whether Sasha or Anna wins.
   - It sums the lengths of the numbers after reversing Anna's moves.
   - It sorts the zero counts of the numbers in descending order and subtracts every second value from the total length.

4. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - It converts the number to a string and counts the number of trailing zeros.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Summing Lengths:**
  - The sum of the lengths of the numbers after Anna's moves is calculated using `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`.
  - This part is correct because it accounts for the lengths of the numbers after they might have been reversed.

- **Sorting Zero Counts:**
  - `cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)` sorts the zero counts in descending order.
  - This step is unnecessary for determining the final length of the numbers but might be intended to help in some optimization.

- **Subtracting Every Second Value:**
  - The loop `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):` iterates over every second value in the sorted list and subtracts it from `tot`.
  - This subtraction is intended to simulate Sasha's concatenation moves, but it is not directly related to the actual lengths of the numbers.

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The function returns `'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`.
  - This condition checks if the total length is at least \(m+1\), which is correct for determining Sasha's win.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total length of the numbers after Anna's moves. The sorting and zero count calculations are unnecessary but do not affect the correctness of the winning condition.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
