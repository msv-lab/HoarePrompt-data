Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `l` is `func_2() + 3`, and the condition `(cnt == 1 and l == n + 1)` is true.**

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, which increments the value of `cnt` by 1 since it was initially 0. After calling `func_2()`, `cnt` becomes 1. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it is defined as `func_2() + 3`. The condition `(cnt == 0 and l == n + 1)` was true before the call to `func_2()`, and since `cnt` has now become 1, this condition is no longer true. However, the updated values of `cnt` and `l` are included in the output state.
