Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 4.

The `print` statement is `print('No esta en el rango')`.

Since the values of `casos`, `t`, and `n` are not specified and do not affect the print statement, the output will simply be the string provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
