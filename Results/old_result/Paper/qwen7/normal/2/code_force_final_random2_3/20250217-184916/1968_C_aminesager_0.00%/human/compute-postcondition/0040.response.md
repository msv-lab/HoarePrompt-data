Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` splits the string `line` into a list of substrings based on spaces and then converts each substring to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `T`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
