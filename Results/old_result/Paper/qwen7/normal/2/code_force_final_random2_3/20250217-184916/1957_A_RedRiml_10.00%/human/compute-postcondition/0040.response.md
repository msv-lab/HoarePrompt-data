Output State: **`shapes` is 1, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` must have at least one element, and the current value of `j` satisfies d[j] being greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. Initially, `shapes` was 0, so after executing this line, `shapes` becomes 1. The values of `palka`, `d`, `pl`, and the condition involving `j` remain unchanged.
