You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which, based on the given information, is 2 times), the list `a` will contain four elements. The first element is the initial input integer provided in the initial state. The next two elements are the new input integers provided during the first iteration of the loop, and the fourth element is the new input integer provided during the second iteration of the loop. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer provided, which is the input for the second iteration.

    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `n` will be the length of the concatenated string formed by `a[0]` and `a[1]` minus one. The variable `s` will contain the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `x-th` element of `a[1]`, where `x` is the last index `i` that satisfied either of the conditions in the loop. The variables `t`, `a`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.

        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1

    #This is printed: -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2`. For each test case, it constructs a new binary string `s` by concatenating parts of `a_1` and `a_2` based on certain conditions. It then calculates a value `t` representing the length of a matching segment between `s` and a substring of `a_2`, and returns this value. If no match is found, `t` is set to -1. The function prints the constructed string `s` and the value `t`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Grid Reading**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.
3. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It uses variables `x` and `y` to track the position where the path changes direction.
   - The program checks if the next cell in the first row is '0' and the current cell in the second row is '1'. If so, it updates `y`.
   - It also checks if the next cell in the first row is '1' and the current cell in the second row is '0'. If so, it constructs the initial part of the path `s` up to the current position and sets `x` to the current index. It then breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such positions are found, it means the path must go down to the last cell, and it constructs the path accordingly.
4. **Path Counting**:
   - After constructing the initial part of the path `s`, it iterates from `y` to `x` to count how many times the remaining part of the path matches the constructed string `s`.
   - This count is stored in `t`.
5. **Output**:
   - It prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It prints the count `t` of paths that yield this string.

However, there are some issues with the logic:

- The program assumes that the first '1' in the second row will always lead to the smallest path, which is not necessarily true. It should consider all possible paths to ensure the lexicographically smallest string is found.
- The program does not handle the case where the entire path is determined by the first row (all '0's), which would result in a different smallest string.
- The counting logic might not be accurate if there are multiple valid paths that yield the same string.

Given these issues, the program does not fully implement the required logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and count the number of such paths accurately.
