Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The precondition that `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers obtained from the input, but their specific values are not known.
