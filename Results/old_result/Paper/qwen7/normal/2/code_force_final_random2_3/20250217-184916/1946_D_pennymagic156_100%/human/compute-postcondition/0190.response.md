Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `val` is the second element of `a`.
   - `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the result of `op` is `False`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, the next value of `val` will be the third element of `a`.
   - The list `a` will have one less element because the second element was already processed.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `a` will now be a list with one less element (since the second element was processed).
   - `val` will be the third element of the updated list `a`.
   - `op` and `cnt` remain unchanged from the previous iteration since they depend on the current `val` and not the position in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list with one less element, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the result of `op` is `False`.**
