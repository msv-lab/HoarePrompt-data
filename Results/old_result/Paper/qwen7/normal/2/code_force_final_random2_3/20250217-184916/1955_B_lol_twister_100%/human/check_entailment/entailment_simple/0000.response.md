Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list `l` can form a progressive square based on the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the expected values for a progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`.
3. The function then sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` and checks if they are equal.
4. If the sorted lists are equal, it means the input list `l` can indeed form a progressive square, and the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.
5. The provided code does not have any logical errors based on the problem statement and the given constraints.
6. The state transitions and the logic flow within the function are consistent with the problem requirements.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
