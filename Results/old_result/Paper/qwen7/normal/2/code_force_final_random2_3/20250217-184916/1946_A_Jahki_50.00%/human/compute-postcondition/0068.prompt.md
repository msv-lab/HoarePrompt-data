Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is equal to `median`, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a`, `median` is `b[ma]` (where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd).
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 1, `new_median` is equal to the value at index `ma` of list `b`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 2, `new_median` is equal to the value at index `ma-1` of list `b`, and `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `b[ma]` is increased by 1, `new_median` is now equal to `b[ma-1]`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 3, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, and `b` is sorted again.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
