Output State: **`i` is 7, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[8] + 0 // 8`, `rem` is `0 % 9`, `y` is `n - 8`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables; it only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
