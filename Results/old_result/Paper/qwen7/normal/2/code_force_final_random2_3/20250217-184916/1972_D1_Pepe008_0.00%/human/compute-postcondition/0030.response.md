Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `b + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 1 and goes up to `b + 1`.
   - `b` is derived from `info[1]`, which is an integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will definitely execute at least once if `b + 1` is greater than 1.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `b` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the given states**:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `T` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` is `int(info[1])`.
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `suma` is 0.
   - The loop body is omitted but does not affect the initial state needed for the loop to execute.

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `b` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - All other variables (`t`, `T`, `a`, `info`, `suma`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`b` must be at least 1**.
