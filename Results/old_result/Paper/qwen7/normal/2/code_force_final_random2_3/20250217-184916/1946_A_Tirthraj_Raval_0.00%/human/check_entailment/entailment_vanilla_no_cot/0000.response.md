Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current implementation simply counts how many times the median value appears in the array, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:

1. Find the median value in the sorted array.
2. Count how many elements are less than or equal to the median.
3. Determine the difference between the median and the next smallest element greater than the median.
4. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the smallest element greater than or equal to the median.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median = a[p]
        
        # Count how many elements are less than or equal to the median
        count_leq_median = sum(1 for x in a if x <= median)
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        min_operations = 0
        if count_leq_median == 0:
            min_operations = 1
        else:
            min_operations = max(0, median - a[p - 1] + 1) if p > 0 else 1
        
        print(min_operations)

func()
```

This corrected version will properly compute the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array.
