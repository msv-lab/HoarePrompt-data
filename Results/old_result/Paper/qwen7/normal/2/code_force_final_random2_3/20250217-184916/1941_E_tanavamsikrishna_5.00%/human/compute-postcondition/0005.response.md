Output State: **`total_costs` is now a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, and `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list to `total_costs`. Initially, `i` is set to 0, so the first `k` elements of `costs` are summed and appended to `total_costs`. The values of `rows` and `costs` remain unchanged, and `i` is not modified within this snippet. The condition `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must still be at least 1, ensuring there are enough elements in `costs` to form at least one segment of length `k`.
