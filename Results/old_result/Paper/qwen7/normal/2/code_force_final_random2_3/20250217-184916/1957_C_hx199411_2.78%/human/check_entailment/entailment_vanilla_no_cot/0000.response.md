Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after the given moves. Here's a brief explanation of why the solution is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Tracking Used Positions**: The variable `num` tracks the number of positions where either a rook was placed directly or mirrored. If the positions are mirrored (`c == r`), only one position is counted; otherwise, two positions are counted.
3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**: The variable `m` represents the number of remaining positions on the board that can still have rooks placed without attacking any existing rooks.
4. **Dynamic Programming for Configurations**: The code uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions. The array `dp` is used to store intermediate results, ensuring that the solution is efficient even for large values of `m`.
5. **Modulo Operation**: The solution ensures that the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided function correctly computes the number of possible final configurations for each test case.
