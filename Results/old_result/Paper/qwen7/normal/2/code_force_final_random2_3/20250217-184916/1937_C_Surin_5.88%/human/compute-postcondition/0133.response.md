Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is `i`
   - `v2` is `i`
   - `v1` is equal to the input string `r` if `r` is equal to '<'

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must hold true. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `i` before, it will now be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the New State**: Based on the above steps, the new state should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged value of `n`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `v2` is `i + 1`, and `v1` is equal to the input string `r` if `r` is equal to '<'**
