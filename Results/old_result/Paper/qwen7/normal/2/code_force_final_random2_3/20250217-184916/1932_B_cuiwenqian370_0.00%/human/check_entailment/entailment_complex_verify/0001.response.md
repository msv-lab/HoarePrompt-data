### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Mismatch**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not match the problem description. The problem involves determining the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities, whereas the code deals with a different problem related to paths and dynamic programming.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process a string where '@' represents a valid state and '*' represents an invalid state. It calculates the maximum number of valid states using dynamic programming. This logic is unrelated to the problem of determining the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur.
   - The function `func_1` does not use the input parameters in a way that would help determine the year of the apocalypse based on the periodicities of the signs.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` on each test case. However, since `func_1` is not solving the correct problem, the overall program is still incorrect.

4. **Correctness of the Given Code**:
   - Given that the functions provided do not implement the logic required to solve the problem described, the program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not implement the logic required to determine the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities.
