You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [(i + 1) for i, el in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        
        if el == '>':
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)

                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now `-1`. At this point, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, but it has been reduced by the number of iterations (which is `n`). `totalOne` is 0 because it has been decremented until it reaches 0. `suffZero` is a list containing only 0, as it was appended to in each iteration but never removed from. `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, as no non-zero values were added to it within the loop since the conditions for updating `ans` were not met in any iteration.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` has reached `-1`, indicating the loop has completed. The list `preOne` has been reduced to a size of `n` minus the number of iterations, `totalOne` is 0, `suffZero` contains only the initial 0, and `ans` remains a list of zeros of length `n`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (n times)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it processes the string `s1` based on its content and length.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
