Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. 

- The `func_1` function calculates the profit for a given `k` value using the formula provided in the problem description.
- The `func_2` function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` value that maximizes the profit. It iteratively narrows down the range of possible `k` values and uses `func_1` to compute the profit for each midpoint value to determine the maximum profit.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` value is found efficiently, and the profit calculation is accurate for any valid input within the specified ranges. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
