State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `n`, and the implicit variable `range(n)`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `n > 0` must be satisfied because `range(n)` generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins, as `range(n)` starts generating values from 0 up to `n-1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0.
