Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `profit_mid` is not updated; `max_profit` is not updated; `profit_next` is not updated.**

Explanation: The code calculates the new value of `mid` as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. This operation does not affect the values of `low`, `high`, `profit_mid`, `max_profit`, or `profit_next`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous conditions.
