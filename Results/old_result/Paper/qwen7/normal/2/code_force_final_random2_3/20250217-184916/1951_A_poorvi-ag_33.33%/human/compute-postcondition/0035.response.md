Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, `results` list is ['no', 'no']**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the end of the `results` list. Initially, `results` is `['no']`. After appending `'no'`, the `results` list becomes `['no', 'no']`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
