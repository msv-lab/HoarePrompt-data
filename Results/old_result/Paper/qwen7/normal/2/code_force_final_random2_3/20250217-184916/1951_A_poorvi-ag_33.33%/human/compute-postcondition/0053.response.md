Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for r in results:`. The only variable here is `r`, which iterates over the `results` list.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. Since the `results` list contains 'no' repeated `t` times, where `t` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, the loop will run exactly `t` times, appending 'no' to the `results` list in each iteration.

3. **Determine the Final State of `results`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` will be a list containing 'no' repeated `t` times.

4. **State of Other Variables**: The values of `start`, `end`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` will reflect their state after the last iteration of the loop. However, since the problem does not provide specific information about these variables, we cannot adjust their states directly based on the given information.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: The only state that needs adjustment is the `results` list itself. We know that the loop will append 'no' to the `results` list `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `results` list.

**State:**
**`results` is a list containing 'no' repeated `t` times, where `t` is the total number of iterations the loop executed.**
