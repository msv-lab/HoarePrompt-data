Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers; `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`; `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2 (the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd); `l` is `yb - x` if `yb - x` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `l` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns `l` the value of `max(1, yb - x)`. Given that `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2 and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `x` is an integer. Since `yb - x` is compared against 1, `l` will be `yb - x` if `yb - x` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `l` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
