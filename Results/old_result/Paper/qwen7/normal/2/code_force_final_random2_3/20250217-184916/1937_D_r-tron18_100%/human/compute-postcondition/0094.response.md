The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the string `s1`. The length of `s1` is constrained such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it processes the string `s1` based on its content and length.**
