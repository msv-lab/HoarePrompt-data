Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is now `temp * 2` (which was either 2 or 4), and `temp * 2` is now less than `k`.**

Explanation: The code `temp *= 2` multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2. Given that `temp` was either 2 or 4 initially, after executing this line, `temp` will now be 4 or 8 respectively. Additionally, the condition `temp * 2 < k` is checked, which means `temp * 2` is now less than `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
