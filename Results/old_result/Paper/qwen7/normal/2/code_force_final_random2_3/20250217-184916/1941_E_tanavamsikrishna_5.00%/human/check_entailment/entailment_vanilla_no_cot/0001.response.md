Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function aims to calculate the cost of placing supports in a single row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function iterates through the row starting from index `d - 1`.
   - For each element at index `i`, it sets the value to the minimum cost of placing a support within the last `d` elements plus the current depth plus 1.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `i > 0`, the cost is calculated as the minimum cost of placing a support in the previous `d` elements plus the current depth plus 1.
   - If `i <= 0`, the cost is simply the current depth plus 1 (since there's no need to consider previous elements).

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the final cost of the last element in the row.

The logic in `func_1` seems correct for ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function processes the entire input and calculates the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from the input.
   - It reads the grid of depths `rows` where each row is a list of integers.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**:
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of placing supports in that row.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It sums up the costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these sums in `total_costs`.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic correctly ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The cost calculation is correct as it considers the minimum cost of placing a support in the previous `d` elements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The input parsing and processing are correct.
   - The cost calculation for each row using `func_1` is correct.
   - The total cost calculation for each set of `k` consecutive rows is correct.
   - The output is the minimum total cost, which is correct.

Given that both functions appear to implement the required logic correctly, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
