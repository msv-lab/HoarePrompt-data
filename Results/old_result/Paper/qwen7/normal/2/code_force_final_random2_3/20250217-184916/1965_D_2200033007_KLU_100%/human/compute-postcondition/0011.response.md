Output State: **The program returns the last element of bigList, which is the same as the last element of smallList when the loop ends**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `bigList` is an empty list, and `smallList` is a list of integers. The loop continues to run as long as `smallList` is not empty and the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`. Once this condition is no longer met, the loop stops. At the end of the loop, `bigList` is emptied, and `smallList` is reduced to its last element if the condition still holds. Therefore, `bigList[-1]` would be the same as `smallList[-1]` when the loop ends, and the program returns this value.
