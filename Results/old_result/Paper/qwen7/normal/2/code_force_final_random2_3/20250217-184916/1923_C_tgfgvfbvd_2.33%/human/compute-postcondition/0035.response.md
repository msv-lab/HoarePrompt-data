Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is the first integer from the input split.
- `b` is the second integer from the input split.
- `m` is -1.
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer input from the first split.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`.
- `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`.
- `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop.
- `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement does not depend on any of the variables `a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, or `s`, it will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
