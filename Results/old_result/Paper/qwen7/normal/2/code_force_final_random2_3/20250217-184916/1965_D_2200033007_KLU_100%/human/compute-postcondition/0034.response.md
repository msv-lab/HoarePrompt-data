Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop iterates from `i` to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: At the end of each iteration, `sm` is updated by adding `a[j]` to its previous value, and `j` remains unchanged. Additionally, `cts` is appended with the current value of `sm`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `sm` is updated to include the value of `a[j]` from the previous iteration.
   - `j` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `cts` is appended with the current value of `sm`.

Given that the loop starts with `j` being in the range `[i, len(a))`, let's assume `j` was at some value `k` in the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `j` will still be `k`.

Since `sm` is updated in each iteration, and `cts` is appended with the new value of `sm`, we need to update these values accordingly.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `sm` will be updated to include the next element in the list `a` if the loop continues.
   - `cts` will be appended with the new value of `sm`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State:**
- `sm` is equal to its previous value plus `a[k+1]` (assuming `j` was `k` in the previous iteration).
- `j` remains unchanged.
- `cts` is a list with the appended value of `sm`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we'll keep it as `j` and update `sm` and `cts` accordingly.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sm` is equal to its previous value plus `a[j]`, `j` remains unchanged, `cts` is a list with the appended value of `sm`**.
