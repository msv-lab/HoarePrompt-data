Output State: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list from `current_profit`. The `removed_item` here refers to the last item of the original `combined` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
