Reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Drawing Condition**: The condition `if xa > xb` is used to determine if the game is a draw. However, this condition is incorrect because it should be `if xa < xb`. If Alice's chip is in a higher row than Bob's, Alice can always force a draw by moving her chip to the same row as Bob without allowing Bob to capture her chip. Conversely, if Alice's chip is in a lower row, she can potentially win by forcing Bob into a position where he cannot avoid capturing her chip.

3. **Winning Conditions for Alice and Bob**:
   - For Alice to win, she needs to be able to force Bob into a position where he must capture her chip. This is checked using the ranges defined by `l` and `r`.
   - For Bob to win, he needs to be able to force Alice into a position where she must capture his chip. This is also checked using similar logic but with different conditions.

4. **Logic for Alice's Winning Condition**:
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true, it means the difference in rows is odd. In this case, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he must capture her chip.
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is false, it means the difference in rows is even. Alice can still force Bob into a position where he must capture her chip if the y-range allows it.

5. **Logic for Bob's Winning Condition**:
   - Similar logic applies to Bob, but the conditions are slightly different due to the direction of movement.

Given these points, the program logic is flawed in determining the correct outcomes. Specifically, the condition `if xa > xb` should be `if xa < xb`.

Correctness: **False**
