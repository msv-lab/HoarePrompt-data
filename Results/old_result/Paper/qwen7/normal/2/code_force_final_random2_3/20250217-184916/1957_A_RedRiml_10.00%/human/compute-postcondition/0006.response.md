Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in palka:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `palka`. For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one element.

3. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `w` is an input integer.
   - `ln` is an input integer.
   - `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `pl` is an empty list.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `palka`, we need to ensure that `palka` contains at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in `palka` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `palka` must contain at least one element.
- `i` will take on the value of each element in `palka` during each iteration.

Given these considerations, the final state should be:

**State: **`palka` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `palka`**.
