The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `nodes` representing a graph, an integer `start` indicating the starting node, and an integer `parent` indicating the parent node. It returns `False` if the starting node has only one neighbor which is the parent node. Otherwise, it recursively checks the neighbors of the starting node (excluding the parent) and constructs a list `distances` containing the negation of the recursive calls' results. Finally, it returns `True` if any element in `distances` is `True`, and `False` otherwise.
