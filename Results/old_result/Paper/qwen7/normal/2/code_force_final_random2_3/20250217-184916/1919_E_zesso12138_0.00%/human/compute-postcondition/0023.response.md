Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 3`, `t` is `t - 1`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `p` using the `map` function to convert elements from `data` starting at `index` and continuing for `n` elements into integers. The values of `data`, `index`, `t`, and `n` are updated according to the given rules, and `p` is a new list containing the converted integers.
