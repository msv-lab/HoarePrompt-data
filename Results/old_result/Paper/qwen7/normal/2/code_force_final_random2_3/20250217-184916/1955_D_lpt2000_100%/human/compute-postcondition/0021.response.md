Postcondition: `aa` is a list such that `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 to become `D[out_aa] - 1`. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is now greater than 0 - 1. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
