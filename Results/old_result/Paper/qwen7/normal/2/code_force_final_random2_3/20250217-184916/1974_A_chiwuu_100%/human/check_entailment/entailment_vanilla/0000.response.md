Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - `t = b`: This initializes `t` with the number of 2x2 icons.
   - If `t` is even, `t = t // 2`: This calculates the number of full 2x2 grids that can fit.
   - Otherwise, `t = t // 2 + 1`: This calculates the number of full 2x2 grids plus one additional grid if there is a remainder.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - `if t1 >= a`: This checks if the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons.
     - If true, `t` remains unchanged.
     - If false, it proceeds to the next step.

4. **Additional Screens Calculation**:
   - `t2 = a - t1`: This calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
   - `if t2 % 15 == 0`: This checks if the remaining 1x1 icons can fill exactly 15 cells.
     - If true, `t = t + t2 // 15`: This adds the number of additional screens needed.
     - If false, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`: This adds the number of additional screens needed, rounding up.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `t`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to verify its correctness.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`

```python
(a, b) = (1, 1)
t = b
if t % 2 == 0:
    t = t // 2
else:
    t = t // 2 + 1
t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
if t1 >= a:
    t = t
else:
    t2 = a - t1
    if t2 % 15 == 0:
        t = t + t2 // 15
    else:
        t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
print(t)
```

- `t = 1`
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
- Since `11 < 1`, we proceed to the next step.
- `t2 = 1 - 11 = -10` (not possible, so we consider `t2 = 1`)
- `t = 1 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2` (but since we have only 1 icon, it should be 1)

#### Example 2:
- Input: `7 2`
- Expected Output: `1`

```python
(a, b) = (7, 2)
t = b
if t % 2 == 0:
    t = t // 2
else:
    t = t // 2 + 1
t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
if t1 >= a:
    t = t
else:
    t2 = a - t1
    if t2 % 15 == 0:
        t = t + t2 // 15
    else:
        t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
print(t)
```

- `t = 1`
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
- Since `7 < 7`, we proceed to the next step.
- `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0`
- `t = 1 + 0 // 15 + 0 = 1`
