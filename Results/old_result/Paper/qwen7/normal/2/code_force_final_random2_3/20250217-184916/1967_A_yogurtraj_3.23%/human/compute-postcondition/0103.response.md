Output State: **`i` is 7, `r` is `a[8] + k // 8`**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 7, the expression becomes `a[7] + k // 8`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and the expression `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)` evaluates to true remains valid.
