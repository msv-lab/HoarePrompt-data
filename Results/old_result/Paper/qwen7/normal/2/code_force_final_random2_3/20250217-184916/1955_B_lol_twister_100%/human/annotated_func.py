#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9 for all i.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is 499, `n` is 500, `h` is 499, and `li` is a list of 250,000 elements. Each element in `li` is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` ranges from 0 to 499 and `h` ranges from 0 to 499 for the first 250,000 elements, and then `k` resets to 0 and `h` continues from 500 to 999 for the next 250,000 elements.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `k` will be 499, `n` will still be 500, and `h` will be 499 because the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain 250,000 elements. For the first 250,000 elements, each element is the value of the expression `a + k * c + d * h` with `k` ranging from 0 to 499 and `h` ranging from 0 to 499. For the next 250,000 elements, `k` resets to 0 and `h` continues from 500 to 999, maintaining the same expression.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    #State: `k` is 499, `n` is 500, `h` is 499, `li` is a sorted list of 500,000 elements, and `li` is not equal to `l`
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \)), two integers \( c \) and \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6 \)), and a list \( l \) of \( n^2 \) integers (where \( 1 \leq l[i] \leq 10^9 \) for all \( i \)). It generates a new list \( li \) based on the minimum value of \( l \) and the parameters \( c \) and \( d \), sorts both \( l \) and \( li \), and compares them. If the sorted lists are identical, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
