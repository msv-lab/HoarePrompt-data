Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`.
   - `mak2` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `mak` can be either 0 or 1, but since it is used as an index into the list `pans`, it must be within the bounds of the list. Given that `pans` contains integers from `n-1` to `0`, and assuming `n` is at least 2 (since `i` is 2), `mak` can be 0 or 1 without causing an out-of-bounds error.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `pans[mak]` will be the element at the index specified by `mak` in the list `pans`.
   - Since `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, if `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` will be `n-1`, and if `mak` is 1, `pans[mak]` will be `n-2`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `mak` is 0, then `pans[mak]` is `n-1`, and the print statement becomes:
     ```
     print('?', n-1, n-1, 2, 2)
     ```
   - If `mak` is 1, then `pans[mak]` is `n-2`, and the print statement becomes:
     ```
     print('?', n-2, n-2, 2, 2)
     ```

Given that `mak` can be either 0 or 1, the output will depend on the value of `mak`. However, since the problem does not specify which value `mak` takes, we need to consider both possibilities.

**Final Output:**
Output: **'? [n-1] [n-1] 2 2' or '? [n-2] [n-2] 2 2' (where [n-1] or [n-2] is the value of pans[mak] depending on the value of mak, and 2 is the value of pans[i])**
