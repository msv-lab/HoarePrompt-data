Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `ap`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition of being a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, while `ap` is now an integer obtained from the input.
