Output State: The `results` list will contain 'no' repeated `t` times, where `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` will reflect the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations. Specifically, `i` will be equal to `t`, and the `results` list will consist of 'no' repeated `t` times, unless there was an iteration where the conditions `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr` were met, in which case the last element of the `results` list would be 'yes'.

This means that if any of the inputs during the loop iterations satisfied the condition `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr`, the last element of the `results` list will be 'yes', and all preceding elements will be 'no'. Otherwise, all elements in the `results` list will be 'no'.
