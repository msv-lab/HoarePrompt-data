Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `s` is a string input from the user, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string.**

The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `a` being 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` being 'SQUARE' or an empty string depends on the content of `s`, specifically whether it contains exactly one '1'.
