Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, `idx` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `prev = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `prev`. The other variables (`odds`, `a`, `idx`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The only change is that `prev` now holds the value of `x` from the previous iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1.
