Postcondition: `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted. If `len(final) == 0`, then `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 and `final` contains one element which is 0. Otherwise, `c1` is less than 50 and `final` includes the element `n`.
