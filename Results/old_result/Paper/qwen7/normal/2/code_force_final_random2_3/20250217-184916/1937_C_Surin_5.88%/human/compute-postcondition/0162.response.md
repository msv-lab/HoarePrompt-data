Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `r` is an input string**

The variable `r` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is treated as a string. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid, but since no operation was performed on `n`, its exact value is not known.
