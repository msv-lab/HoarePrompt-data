Output State: **`left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - 4`, `right` is greater than 6, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0', and `s[right]` must not be '0'**.

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Initially, `right` was greater than 5, so now it is greater than 6. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
