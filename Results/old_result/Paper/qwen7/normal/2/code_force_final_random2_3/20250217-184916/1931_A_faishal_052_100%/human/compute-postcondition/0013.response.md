Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is a list containing 26, `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than 52, and `j` is 0.**

The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
