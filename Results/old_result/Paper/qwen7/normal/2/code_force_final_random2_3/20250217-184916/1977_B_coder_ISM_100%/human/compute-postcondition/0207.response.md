Output State: **`i` is 28, `length` is exactly 29, `s[28]` is '0', `s[27]` is '1', `s[29]` is '0', `flag` is 1, `nalla` is `t-1`, `x` is an input integer.**

The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `x`. Since the initial values of other variables are not altered by this line of code, they remain unchanged. The variable `x` now holds the value of the integer input from the user.
