Postcondition: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `yb`, `l`, `r` are integers. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is `yb - x` if `yb - x` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `l` is 1; `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - xa`; `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.**
