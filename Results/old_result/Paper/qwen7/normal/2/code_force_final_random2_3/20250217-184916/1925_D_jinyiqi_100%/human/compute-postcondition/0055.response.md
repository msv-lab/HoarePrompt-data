Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus twice the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer.**

Explanation: The line `sum_f += f` adds the current value of `f` to `sum_f`. Since `sum_f` was initially the sum of all input values of `f` plus the latest input value of `f`, adding `f` again means it now includes the latest input value of `f` twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
