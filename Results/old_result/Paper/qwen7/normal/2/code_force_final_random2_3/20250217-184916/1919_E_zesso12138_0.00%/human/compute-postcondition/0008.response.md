Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**.

This means that the `index` variable has been incremented by 1, and `n` will now be the integer value of the element at the new index position in the `data` list. The `data` list and the original `index` value before incrementation remain unchanged.
