Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), the number of excursions (k), and a list of friendships. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters to compute a result. After processing all test cases, it prints the cumulative result of `func_1` for each test case. If any input is invalid, it returns an error message.**
