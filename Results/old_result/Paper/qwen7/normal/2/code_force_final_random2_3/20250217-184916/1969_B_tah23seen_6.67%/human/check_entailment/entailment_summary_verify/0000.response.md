### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the binary string and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes a binary string `sChar`, converts it into a list of characters, and initializes variables `left` and `right`.
   - It then iterates through the list, attempting to swap '1's and '0's to move all '0's to the left side and all '1's to the right side.
   - The cost is calculated by the sum of the sizes of the subarrays that need to be swapped.
   - There is a special condition where if the length of `sChar` is exactly 11, the function returns 11 plus the number of additional characters beyond 11.

#### Function Summary Analysis:

The function summary states that the function calculates the total cost by moving all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right. However, the summary also mentions a special case where the function returns 11 plus the number of additional characters beyond 11 if the length of `sChar` is exactly 11. This special case is not mentioned in the program, which suggests a discrepancy between the summary and the actual implementation.

#### Correctness Evaluation:

1. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The function summary mentions a special case where the length of `sChar` is exactly 11, but this case is not handled in the program. This could lead to incorrect results for test cases where the length of the string is 11.

2. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program attempts to swap adjacent characters directly, which is not an efficient approach for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The correct approach would involve identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then performing cyclic shifts to sort the remaining part of the string.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost is calculated by the sum of the sizes of the subarrays that need to be swapped, which is not the correct way to calculate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The correct approach would involve finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order due to the incorrect approach and the missing special case handling.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts to sort the binary string.
