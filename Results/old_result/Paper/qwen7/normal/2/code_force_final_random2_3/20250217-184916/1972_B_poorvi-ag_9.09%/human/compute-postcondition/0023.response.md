Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and the original elements, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `results` now contains `'yes'` along with its original elements, `i` is still equal to `t`, `n` retains the value of the integer input by the user, and `arr` is updated to the new input string.
