Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list with `u` appended to the left end.**

The code `tree.appendleft(u)` appends the value of `u` to the left end of the list `tree`. The values of `n`, `i`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged from their initial states.
