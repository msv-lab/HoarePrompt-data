Output State: **`j` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. Since no specific values are provided for these inputs, they are represented as "an input integer". The variables `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
