Output State: **`i` is within the range [0, 29], `length` is 30, and `s` contains '0', and `(x & pow(2, i))` is False**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. The values of `i`, `length`, and the condition `(x & pow(2, i))` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `i` is still within the range [0, 29], `length` is still 30, and the condition `(x & pow(2, i))` is still False. Additionally, the list `s` now contains the string `'0'`.
