Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[l+1]` and `l` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[r-1]` and `r` is decremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`, and `b` is a list.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i = i + 1`).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the range.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
   - The variable `n` remains the same.
   - The variables `s`, `b`, `a`, `l`, and `r` are not directly adjusted by the loop itself but depend on the condition inside the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we do not change these variables here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.
