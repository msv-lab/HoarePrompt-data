Output State: `ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3, ..., 1 << 19]`, `i` is 20, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` must be at least 1048576.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(1 << i + 1 \leq k\). Given that the loop executed 3 times with `i` being 0, 1, and 3 respectively, we can deduce that each iteration roughly doubles the value of `i`. Following this pattern, the loop will continue until \(1 << i + 1\) exceeds `k`. Since the largest power of 2 represented in the list is \(1 << 19\), the loop will run until \(i = 19\), making \(1 << i + 1 = 1 << 20\). Therefore, `i` will be set to 20 when the loop finishes. Given the condition that `k` must be at least 2 after the first iteration, and it needs to support up to \(1 << 20\), `k` must be at least \(1 << 20 = 1048576\).
