Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the required functionality for generating a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern. The program only handles the specific cases for \(n = 1, 2, 3,\) and \(4\). For any other value of \(n\), the program does not generate the correct pattern but instead prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in range" in English).

To generate the correct checkerboard pattern for any \(n\), the program should use nested loops to construct the pattern dynamically rather than hardcoding the patterns for specific values of \(n\).

Here's how the program should be corrected:

```python
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        for i in range(2 * n):
            for j in range(2 * n):
                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:
                    print('#', end='')
                else:
                    print('.', end='')
            print()
```

With this corrected version, the program will correctly generate the 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern for any \(n\) within the specified range.

Correctness: **False**
