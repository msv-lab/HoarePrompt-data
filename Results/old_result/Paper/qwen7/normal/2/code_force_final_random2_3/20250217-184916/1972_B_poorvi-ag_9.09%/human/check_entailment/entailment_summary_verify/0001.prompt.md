You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the number of "U" characters in the string `s` is greater than the number of "D" characters when `n` is odd. If true, it appends "yes" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "no". If `n` is even, it always appends "no". Finally, it prints each element in the results list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.

2. **Determining the Result:**
   - The program checks if `n` is even.
     - If `n` is even, it directly appends 'no' to the results list, assuming Alice cannot win if `n` is even.
     - This part is incorrect because the parity of `n` alone does not determine the winner. We need to consider the number of facing-up coins (`U`).

3. **Counting Facing-Up Coins:**
   - The program counts the number of 'U' and 'D' in the string `arr`.
   - If the count of 'U' is greater than the count of 'D', it appends 'yes' to the results list.
     - This condition is also incorrect. The number of facing-up coins alone does not determine the winner. We need to simulate the game to determine the winner.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The problem requires simulating the game to determine the winner. The current implementation does not simulate the game at all.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the winner, we need to simulate the game based on the rules provided. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(n, arr):
    while True:
        # Find the first facing-up coin
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 'U':
                break
        else:
            # No more facing-up coins, return the result
            return "NO" if n % 2 == 0 else "YES"
        
        # Remove the facing-up coin and flip its neighbors
        if i == 0:
            arr[n-1] = 'D' if arr[n-1] == 'U' else 'U'
            arr[1] = 'D' if arr[1] == 'U' else 'U'
        elif i == n-1:
            arr[0] = 'D' if arr[0] == 'U' else 'U'
            arr[i-1] = 'D' if arr[i-1] == 'U' else 'U'
        else:
            arr[i-1] = 'D' if arr[i-1] == 'U' else 'U'
            arr[i+1] = 'D' if arr[i+1] == 'U' else 'U'
        
        # Update the array to reflect the new state
        arr[i] = 'D'
        
        # Reduce the size of the array
        n -= 1
        
        # Check if only one coin is left
        if n == 1:
            return "NO" if arr[0] == 'U' else "YES"

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        results.append(simulate_game(n, list(arr)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Your response:
Reasoning: The original program does not correctly simulate the game and makes incorrect assumptions about the winner based on the parity of `n` and the count of 'U'. A correct solution should simulate the game according to the rules provided.
Correctness: **False**
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game properly and makes incorrect assumptions about the winner. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
