Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` represented by the string `s` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. The penalty for each subarray is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. The program, however, simply calculates the absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the number of '+' characters, which does not account for the optimal splitting strategy.

The correct approach would involve recognizing that the optimal strategy is to split the array at every transition from '+' to '-' or vice versa, because this minimizes the penalty. This is because each split ensures that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible, thereby minimizing the penalty.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` only computes a simple difference without considering the optimal splitting points. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
