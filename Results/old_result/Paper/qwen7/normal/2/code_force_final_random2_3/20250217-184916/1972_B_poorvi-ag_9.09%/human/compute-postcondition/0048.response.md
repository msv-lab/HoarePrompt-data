Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the number of "U" characters in the string `s` is greater than the number of "D" characters when `n` is odd. If true, it appends "yes" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "no". If `n` is even, it always appends "no". Finally, it prints each element in the results list.**
