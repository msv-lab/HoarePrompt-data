Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `index` is 4, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the second element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the third element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`, and `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, it will be decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given that `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after decrementing `t` by 1, `t` will still be greater than 0 as long as it was initially at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`index` is 4, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 1, `n` is the second element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the third element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`, `t` must be greater than 0**.
