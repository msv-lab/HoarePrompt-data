Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then either `idx1` is set to `i + p1` or `idx2` is set to `i + p2`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions remain as per the initial if part postcondition.
