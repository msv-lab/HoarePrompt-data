Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is fine for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: The program iterates over each test case, extracting `n` (number of coins) and `s` (the state of the coins).
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks the number of coins facing up (`num_up`). If this number is odd, it returns `'YES'`, indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

### Analysis of the Game Logic:
- The game logic involves removing a coin and flipping its neighbors. However, the provided solution does not actually simulate these moves. Instead, it simply counts the number of coins facing up and decides the winner based on whether this count is odd or even.
- The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of coins facing up determines the winner. If the number of coins facing up is odd, Alice can always force a win by making optimal moves. If it is even, Bob can force a win by mirroring Alice's moves.

### Testing the Provided Examples:
- **Case 1**: `UUDUD`
  - Initial state: `UUDUD`
  - Number of coins facing up: 3 (odd)
  - Expected output: `YES`

- **Case 2**: `UDDUD`
  - Initial state: `UDDUD`
  - Number of coins facing up: 2 (even)
  - Expected output: `NO`

- **Case 3**: `UU`
  - Initial state: `UU`
  - Number of coins facing up: 2 (even)
  - Expected output: `NO`

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial count of coins facing up. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
