Let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
3. `n` is the first element of `r`.
4. `m` is the second element of `r`.
5. `x1` is increased by `a`.
6. `y1` is decreased by 1.
7. `x2` is the fifth element of `r`.
8. `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.
9. `x2` is greater than `x1`.
10. `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
11. `b` is `x2 - x1`.
12. `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
13. `x2` is decreased by `a`.
14. Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1` or `x1` is less than 1 or `x2` is greater than `n`.

Given these conditions, let's focus on the `print('draw')` statement. The statement itself does not depend on any specific values of variables but rather on the string literal `'draw'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
