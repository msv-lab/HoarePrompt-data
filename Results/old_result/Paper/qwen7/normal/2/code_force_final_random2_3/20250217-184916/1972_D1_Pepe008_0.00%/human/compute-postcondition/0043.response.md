Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 1)) // (k + 2) + 1`, and `suma` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). Given that `i` is `k + 2`, substituting `i` into the equation gives us \(x = (a - (k + 2) \times (k + 1)) // (k + 2) + 1\). The other variables (`b`, `i`, and `suma`) remain unchanged.
