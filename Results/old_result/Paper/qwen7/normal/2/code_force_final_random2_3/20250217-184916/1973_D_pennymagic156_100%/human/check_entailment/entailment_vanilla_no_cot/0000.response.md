To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Analysis

1. **Initialization and Querying**:
   - The function `func_5` starts by reading the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It then initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward from `n` to 1, querying the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. This helps in determining the maximum possible value of `m`.

2. **Splitting the Array**:
   - After finding the initial value of `v`, the function attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's `f(l, r)` equals `i * v`.
   - It does this by iterating from 1 to `n // k + 1` and querying the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` for each segment.

3. **Checking Validity**:
   - If a valid split is found, it prints the result and ends.
   - If no valid split is found, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Querying Logic**:
   - The initial loop to find `v` assumes that the maximum value of `a_i` is `n`, which might not always be true. The actual maximum value could be less than `n`.
   - The logic to split the array into `k` segments assumes that the product `i * v` can be achieved for each segment, which might not be the case if the array does not allow such splits.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might not allow splitting into `k` segments with the same product `m`.
   - The program does not check if the array can be split into exactly `k` segments with the required properties.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not seem to correctly implement the logic to find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required properties. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
