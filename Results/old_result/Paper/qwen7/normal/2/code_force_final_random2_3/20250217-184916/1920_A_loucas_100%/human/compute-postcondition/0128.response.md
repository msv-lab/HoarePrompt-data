Output State: **`no` contains no integers, `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged, and `num` remains unchanged, `less` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes the list `less` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `no`, `big`, or `num`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `less` is explicitly set to an empty list.
