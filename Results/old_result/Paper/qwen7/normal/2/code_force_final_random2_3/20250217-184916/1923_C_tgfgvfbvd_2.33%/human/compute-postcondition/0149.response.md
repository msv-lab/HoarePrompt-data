Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, and `p` will be a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. The variable `m` will hold the total number of iterations the loop executed. For each query, the variable `s` will be calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` and checked against the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))`. If the condition is met, 'YES' will be printed; otherwise, 'NO'. After processing all queries, the loop will terminate, and the final state of `m` will reflect the total number of queries processed.
