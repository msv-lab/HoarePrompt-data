### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one. This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function correctly separates digits and letters into two lists.
   - **Sorting**: Both lists are sorted, which is necessary to check the conditions.
   - **Checking Conditions**:
     - The first condition checks if any digit is greater than the next digit, ensuring the digits are in non-decreasing order.
     - The second condition checks if any digit is greater than any preceding letter, ensuring no digit comes after a letter.
   - **Constructing Sorted Password**: The function constructs a sorted password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
   - **Comparison**: The function compares the constructed sorted password with the original password to ensure they match, indicating the password meets all conditions.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation of the second condition:
   - The line `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` should be `if i < len(letters) - 1 and digits[i] > letters[i + 1]:`. This ensures that we are comparing each digit with the subsequent letter, not the last letter.

3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program almost correctly implements the logic to verify whether a password is strong according to the given conditions. However, there is a small mistake in the second condition check, which can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
