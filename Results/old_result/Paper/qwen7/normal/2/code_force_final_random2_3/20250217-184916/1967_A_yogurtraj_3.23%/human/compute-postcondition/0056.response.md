Output State: **`i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression becomes `a[3] + k // 4`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` stays as 3, and `r` is calculated as `a[3] + k // 4`.
