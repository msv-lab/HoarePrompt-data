Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression` and returns this value. This is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.
3. The correct approach would be to split the array `a` into segments where the sum of elements in each segment is zero or close to zero to minimize the penalty. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
