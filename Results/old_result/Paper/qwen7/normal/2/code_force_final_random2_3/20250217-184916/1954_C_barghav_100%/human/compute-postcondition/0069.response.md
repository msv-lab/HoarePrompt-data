Functionality: **The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, where both strings represent integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It then compares corresponding characters in these strings. If a character in `x` is less than the corresponding character in `y`, it swaps them. This process continues until the end of the strings. Finally, it prints the modified string `a` followed by the original string `b`. The function does not return any value.**
