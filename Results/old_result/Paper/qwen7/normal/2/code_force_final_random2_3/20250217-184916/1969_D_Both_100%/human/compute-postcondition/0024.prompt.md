Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, `max_profit` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `prices` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `current_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is a positive integer. If `combined` is not empty, `k` is decremented by 1 and `heap` contains the element popped from `combined`. If `combined` is empty, `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `combined` is now one element smaller, `heap` contains the smallest element from `combined`, and `k` is `k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `combined` is now two elements smaller, `heap` contains the smallest element from the original `combined` and possibly the newly popped element, and `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
