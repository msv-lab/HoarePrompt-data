Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2, and the current value of `temp` is less than half of `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `temp` is multiplied by 2, changing its value from 1 (as per the initial state) to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
