Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp[3]` is the maximum of `dp[2]` and `dp[1]` plus 1 if `path[3]` is '@', otherwise plus 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or plus 0 otherwise. Given that `i` is initially 3, this means `dp[3]` is updated based on `dp[2]` and `dp[1]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
