Postcondition: **`a` is a list with at least 5 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the result of cumulative additions and comparisons as described, `u` is a falsy value. Since both the if and else parts do not change the state of the variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
