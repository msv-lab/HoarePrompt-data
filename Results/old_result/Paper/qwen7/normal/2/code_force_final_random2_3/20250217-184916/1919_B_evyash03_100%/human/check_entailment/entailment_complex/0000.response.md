Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The function `func_1` calculates the penalty as the absolute difference between the length of the string `expression` and twice the number of '+' characters in `expression`. This calculation does not align with the problem statement. According to the problem, the penalty should be calculated based on splitting the array into subarrays and then calculating the penalty for each subarray as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length.

2. **Optimal Splitting Logic Missing**: The program does not attempt to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it simply returns a fixed value based on the count of '+' characters and the length of the string.

3. **No Consideration of Subarray Penalties**: The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by considering different ways to split the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The current implementation does not address this requirement.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
