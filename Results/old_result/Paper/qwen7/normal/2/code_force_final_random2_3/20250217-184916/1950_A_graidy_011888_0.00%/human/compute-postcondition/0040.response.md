Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is 'none'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.
