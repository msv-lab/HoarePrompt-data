Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers; `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`; `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2 (the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd); `l` is `yb - x` if `yb - x` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `l` is 1; `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(w, yb + x)` to `r`. This means `r` is now the smaller value between `w` and `yb + x`. The other variables (`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `x`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
