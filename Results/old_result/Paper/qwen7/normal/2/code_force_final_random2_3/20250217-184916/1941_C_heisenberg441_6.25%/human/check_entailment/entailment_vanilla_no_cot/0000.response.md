Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases where the string needs to be made beautiful. Specifically, the function `func_1` only removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" in the string and increments the count. However, it does not ensure that after removing one instance, it checks again for the possibility of another instance of "map" or "pie" immediately following the removal. This can lead to suboptimal solutions where more characters need to be removed than necessary.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The current implementation would remove "map" and then check for "pie", but it wouldn't find another "pie" since "map" was already removed. A better approach would be to keep checking the string after each removal until no more instances of "map" or "pie" are found.

Here's an improved version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while 'map' in s or 'pie' in s:
        if 'map' in s:
            s = s.replace('map', '', 1)
            ans += 1
        elif 'pie' in s:
            s = s.replace('pie', '', 1)
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

This version ensures that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are removed in a way that guarantees the minimum number of deletions.
