Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `y` is `i`, the current value of `a[0][i + 1]` is '0', and the current value of `a[1][i]` is '1'**.

The code `y = i` assigns the value of the variable `i` to `y`. Since the value of `i` is not specified, we keep it as `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
