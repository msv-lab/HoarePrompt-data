The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `times`. It returns the last element of `arr` minus the maximum value between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index calculated as `max(-len(arr), -1 - times)` in `arr`. This calculation ensures that the index used is within the bounds of the list.
