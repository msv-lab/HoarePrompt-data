Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. The function returns a result based on the given `t` and `s`.**

Note: Since the function definition itself does not specify the return type or logic, the functionality described here is based on the provided constraints and expected behavior.
