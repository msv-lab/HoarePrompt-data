Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input separated by a space and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` and `k` remain as input integers, `num` stays at 0, `i` stays at 0, and `c` and `r` are the integers obtained from the input split.
