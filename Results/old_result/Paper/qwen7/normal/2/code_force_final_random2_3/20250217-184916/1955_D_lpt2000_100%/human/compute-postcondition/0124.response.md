Postcondition: `out_aa` is the corresponding element from the slice `aa[:n - m]`. If `C[in_aa] > 0` and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]`, `pairs_in_D`, and `C[out_aa]` remain unchanged, and `in_aa` remains unchanged.
