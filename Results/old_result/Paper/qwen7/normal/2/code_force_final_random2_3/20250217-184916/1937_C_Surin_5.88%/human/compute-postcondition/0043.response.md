Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Since `i` was previously set to `n`, `prev` now holds the same value as `i`, which is `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
