Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and end are integers such that start <= end, t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`. If the count of '1' in the string `s` is greater than 2 and even, then `cnt1` remains greater than 2 and even. Otherwise, the count of '1' in the string `s` is less than or equal to 2 or even, and if the count of '1' is greater than 2 and either odd or exactly 1, then the count of '1' is at least 2 and even, or the substring '11' is present in the string `s`. If the count of '1' is less than or equal to 2 or even and not odd or equal to 1, then the substring '11' is not present in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`, `s` is updated to the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the updated string `s`. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is even, then `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` == 1, `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` also remain unchanged. If `s` contains '11', then `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is the input integer that must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the updated string `s`. If the count of '1' in the string `s` is greater than 2 and even, `cnt1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the string `s` contains '11', `cnt1` is incremented by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
