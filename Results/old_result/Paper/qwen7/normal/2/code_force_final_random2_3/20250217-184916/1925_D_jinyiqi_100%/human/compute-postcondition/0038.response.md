Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`**.

This output state reflects that the variable `p` has been calculated using the given formula, while all other variables retain their initial conditions or the values they would have after each iteration as described in the initial state.
