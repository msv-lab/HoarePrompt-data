#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5; a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m` for each iteration, and this process is repeated `t` times. The variable `i` will be 'F' in the last iteration, and `hmp` will contain counts of characters 'A' through 'F' from the input strings for each iteration. The total `ans` will be the cumulative sum of the adjustments made based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- For each of the `t` iterations, the loop processes the input string `s` and updates `ans` based on the counts of characters 'A' through 'F'.
    #- The final value of `ans` is the sum of all adjustments made across all iterations.
    #- The variable `i` will be 'F' in the last iteration, indicating the loop has completed its final pass through the characters 'A' to 'F'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of differences between \( m \) and the count of specific characters ('A' to 'F') in the string \( s \). This sum is computed for each character and each test case, and the final result is printed. The function effectively determines how many additional occurrences of characters 'A' to 'F' are needed to meet the requirement specified by \( m \) across all given strings in all test cases.
