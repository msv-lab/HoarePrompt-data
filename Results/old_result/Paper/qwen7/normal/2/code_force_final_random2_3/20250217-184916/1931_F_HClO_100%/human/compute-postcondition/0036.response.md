Output State: **`idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` was initially 0, `idx1` and `idx2` are also set to 0. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
