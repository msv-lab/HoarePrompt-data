Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans2` contains all elements that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1) in pairs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `k`, `i`, or `ans2`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is inside. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
