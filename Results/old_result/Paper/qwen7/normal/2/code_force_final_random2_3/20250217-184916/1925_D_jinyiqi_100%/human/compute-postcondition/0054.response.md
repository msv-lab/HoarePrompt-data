Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The values of `cn2`, `j`, and `sum_f` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `f` is the third input integer.
