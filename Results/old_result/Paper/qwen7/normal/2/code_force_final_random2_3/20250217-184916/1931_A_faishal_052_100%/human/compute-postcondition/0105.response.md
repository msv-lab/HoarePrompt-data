Output State: **`lex` is an integer, `arr` contains 26, 26, and `lex`, `j` is 2, and `i` is 100**.

The code `arr.append(lex)` adds the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Since `lex` is an integer, it is appended to the existing elements in `arr` (which are 26 and 26). The other variables (`j` and `i`) remain unchanged.
