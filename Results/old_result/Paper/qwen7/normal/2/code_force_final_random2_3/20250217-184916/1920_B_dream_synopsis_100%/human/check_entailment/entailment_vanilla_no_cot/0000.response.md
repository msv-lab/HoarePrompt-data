Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sums`:**
   - The logic for calculating `sums` is flawed. Specifically, the line `sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` is incorrect because it doesn't correctly account for the removal of elements by Alice and the negation of elements by Bob.
   
2. **Redundant `ans` List:**
   - The `ans` list is not necessary and complicates the logic. Instead, we should directly compute the maximum possible sum after Alice's and Bob's optimal moves.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to minimize the negative impact on the sum.
   - Bob should negate the smallest positive elements to minimize the sum further.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Remove k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Negate up to x smallest positive elements
        negated_sum = sum(-a[i] if a[i] > 0 else a[i] for i in range(min(x, len(a))))
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        final_sum = sum(a) + negated_sum
        
        print(final_sum)

func()
```

This solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players and calculates the final sum accurately.
