Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `required_mod_x`:**
   The calculation of `required_mod_x` should be `(x - mod_x) % x`, but this logic is flawed. Instead, you need to find the numbers that would make the sum `a_i + a_j` divisible by `x`. This requires finding the complement of `a_i % x` within the range `[0, x-1]`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Beautiful Pairs:**
   The program tries to use frequency counts to find pairs, but the logic for determining the required mods is incorrect. Specifically, for each number `a_i`, you need to check how many numbers `a_j` exist such that both conditions are met.

3. **Debugging Statements:**
   The debug statements are printing unnecessary information and might interfere with the program's performance and correctness. However, these are not the primary issue here.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = [0] * x
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            
            # Calculate the required mods for the sum condition
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            
            # Check if there are any numbers that satisfy the conditions
            for i in range(x):
                if (i - required_mod_x) % x == 0 and (i - mod_y) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += freq[i]
            
            # Update the frequency count
            freq[mod_x] += 1
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This corrected version properly calculates the required mods and updates the frequency counts to find the number of beautiful pairs.
