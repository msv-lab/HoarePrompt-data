Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer within the range of 1 to 5000, and `p`, a sorted list of `n` integers where the absolute value of each element does not exceed `n`. It returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus an offset, and `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\). Each element `dp[j]` in `dp` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) represents the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values that are greater than 0, taken modulo `MOD`.**
