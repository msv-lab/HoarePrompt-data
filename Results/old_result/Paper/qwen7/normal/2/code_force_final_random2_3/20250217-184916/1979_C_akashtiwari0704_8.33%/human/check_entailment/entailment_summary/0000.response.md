Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to distribute coins across different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means the sum of the bets should be less than the product of the multipliers.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`bets`) and the multipliers (`a`).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then generates a new list where each element is the product divided by the corresponding multiplier (`a[i] = prod // a[i]`).
   - It sums the elements of this new list (`sumo`).
   - If the sum (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to the product (`prod`), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of the new list separated by spaces.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic to calculate the product and distribute the bets is correct.
   - The condition to check if the sum of the bets is less than the product is also correct.
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
