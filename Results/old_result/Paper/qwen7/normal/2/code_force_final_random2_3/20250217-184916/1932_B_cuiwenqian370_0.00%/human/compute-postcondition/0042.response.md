Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` is the length of `path`; `dp[4]` is `-inf`; `dp[i]` is `-inf`.**

Explanation: The code `dp[i] = -float('inf')` sets `dp[i]` to `-inf`. Given that `i` is 4, `dp[4]` is updated to `-inf`. The other variables (`n`, `path`, and the specific conditions for `dp[4]`) remain unchanged.
