You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) each ranging from 1 to 9. For each set, it determines and prints whether the sequence forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' pattern based on the values of x, y, and z. After completing 1000 iterations, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program generates random test cases and determines whether they form a stair, peak, or none. However, the logic inside the `func` function is incorrect. Specifically, the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair or a peak is flawed. Here's why:

- The program checks if `x < y` and then proceeds to check the relationship between `y` and `z`. However, it does not correctly handle the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`).
- The logic inside the conditional statements is incorrect. For example, if `x < y`, it should check if `y > z` to determine a peak, but instead, it directly assigns `res` to either 'peak' or 'none' without checking both conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print(a, b, c, sep=' ')
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print(a, b, c, sep=' ')
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print(a, b, c, sep=' ')
            print('NONE')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case, correctly determining whether the digits form a stair, peak, or none based on the given conditions.
