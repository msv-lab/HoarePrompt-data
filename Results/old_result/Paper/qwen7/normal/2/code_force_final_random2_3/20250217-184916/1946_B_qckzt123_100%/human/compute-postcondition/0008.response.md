Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since the initial value of `tmp` is 0, the new value of `tmp` becomes `0 + x`, which simplifies to `tmp + x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
