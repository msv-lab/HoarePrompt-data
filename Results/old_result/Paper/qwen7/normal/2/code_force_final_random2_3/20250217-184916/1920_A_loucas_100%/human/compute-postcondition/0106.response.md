Postcondition: `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is equal to or greater than 3, `iterable2` is 2, `big` is a list that may contain integers based on user inputs where `x == 1`, `less` is a list that may contain integers based on user inputs where `x == 2` and `a` is not already in `less`, `no` is a list that contains integers based on user inputs where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and the current value of `num` is less than 1.
