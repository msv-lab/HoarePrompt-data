Output State: **Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and either `a[r]` is adjusted according to the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` (where `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `r` and `l` are updated accordingly), or the loop breaks due to `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` or `l` being less than or equal to `r`. We break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop. Since the loop's conditions and the adjustments to variables (`sunks`, `k`, `a[r]`, `a[l]`, `r`, and `l`) are defined within the loop, breaking out of the loop means that these operations do not occur. Therefore, the values of `sunks` and `k` remain as they were incremented and updated within the loop, but no further changes are made. The loop's conditions and adjustments are not applied, and we simply exit the loop.
