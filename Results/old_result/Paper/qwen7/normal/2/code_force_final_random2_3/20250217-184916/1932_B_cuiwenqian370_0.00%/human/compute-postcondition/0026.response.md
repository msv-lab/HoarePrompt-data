Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and then decremented by 3.
- `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer.
- `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer.
- `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous contents.

The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `results`.

To determine what is printed, we need to focus on the value of `results`:

- `results` is initialized with the return value of `func_1(path)`, where `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer.

Since the exact content of `data` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `path`. However, we know that `results` will contain the return value of `func_1(path)`.

Therefore, the output will be the return value of `func_1(path)`.

Output: **the return value of func_1(path) (where path is the ninth element of data converted to an integer)**
