Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. The current state of `l3` is such that it does not contain all elements of `l` that are not equal to `a3`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `val`, `a3`, `l3`, or `m`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged.
