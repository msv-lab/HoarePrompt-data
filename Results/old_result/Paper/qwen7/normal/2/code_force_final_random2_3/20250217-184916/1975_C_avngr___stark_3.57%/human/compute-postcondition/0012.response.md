Output State: **`i` is 2, `max` is min(a[2], a[1])**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(a[i], a[i - 1])` to the variable `max`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. Therefore, `max` is assigned the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid, but since no direct assignment or calculation involving `n` is present in the given code, it remains unchanged.
