Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the smallest and second smallest unique elements in the array and counting how many elements are either greater than both these elements or closer to the smaller one when they are not greater than both.
2. However, the logic used to determine the minimum penalty is flawed. The program does not correctly calculate the number of increasing pairs in the two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\). Instead, it seems to be trying to find a way to minimize the penalty by identifying specific elements, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
3. The problem requires splitting the array into two subsequences such that the total number of increasing pairs in both subsequences is minimized. The provided code does not achieve this goal correctly. It does not properly handle the splitting of the array into two subsequences and does not ensure that the penalty is minimized.

Correctness: **False**
