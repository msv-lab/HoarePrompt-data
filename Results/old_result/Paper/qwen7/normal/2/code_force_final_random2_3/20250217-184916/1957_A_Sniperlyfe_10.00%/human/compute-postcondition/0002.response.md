Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is the first element of `arr`, `freq[n]` is the frequency of `n` in the `freq` dictionary which is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the frequency of the first element `n` of the list `arr` in the dictionary `freq`. If `n` already exists in `freq`, its count is incremented by 1. If `n` does not exist, it is added to `freq` with a count of 1. The list `arr` and the first element `n` remain unchanged, but the frequency count of `n` in the dictionary `freq` is updated.
