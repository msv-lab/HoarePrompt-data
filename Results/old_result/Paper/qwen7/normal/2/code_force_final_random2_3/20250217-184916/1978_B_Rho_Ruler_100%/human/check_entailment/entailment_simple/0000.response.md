Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can make by choosing an optimal number \( k \) of buns to sell at a modified price. The modified price for the first \( k \) buns is \( b - i + 1 \) coins, and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**: 
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - The formula used is \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \).
     - \( k \cdot b \): Total revenue from the first \( k \) buns.
     - \( -\frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \): Discounted price adjustment for the first \( k \) buns.
     - \( (n - k) \cdot a \): Revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns.
   - This formula correctly reflects the profit calculation for a given \( k \).

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - It iteratively narrows down the range of \( k \) using binary search.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit for both \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is higher, it updates `low` to \( mid + 1 \); otherwise, it updates `high` to \( mid - 1 \).
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum profit found.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9 \) and \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \) are handled correctly.
   - The binary search approach ensures efficient computation even with large values of \( n \).

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in both functions is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The use of binary search in `func_2` is appropriate for finding the optimal \( k \).

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
