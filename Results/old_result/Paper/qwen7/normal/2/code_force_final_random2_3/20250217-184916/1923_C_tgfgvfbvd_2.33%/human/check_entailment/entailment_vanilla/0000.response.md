### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.
   - A subarray \(c[l_i], c[l_i+1], \ldots, c[r_i]\) is good if there exists another array \(b\) of the same length where:
     1. The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
     2. No element in \(a\) matches the corresponding element in \(b\).
     3. All elements in \(b\) are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If a subarray has at least two distinct elements, it can always be transformed into another array with different values while maintaining the same sum. For example, if we have a subarray `[1, 2]`, we can transform it to `[2, 1]` which still sums to 3 but has different elements.
   - If a subarray has only one distinct element, it cannot be transformed to satisfy the conditions because all elements would need to be different and positive.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code calculates prefix sums and checks if the subarray sum is at least twice the length of the subarray minus one.
   - This logic is flawed because it doesn't fully capture the condition that all elements must be different and positive.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Check if the subarray has more than one distinct element. If it does, it can be transformed to be good.
   - If the subarray has only one distinct element, it cannot be good.

5. **Code Implementation**:
   - Calculate the prefix sums.
   - For each query, check the subarray for distinct elements.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate prefix sums
        p = [0]
        for x in l:
            p.append(p[-1] + x)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            subarray_sum = p[b] - p[a-1]
            subarray_length = b - a + 1
            
            # Check if the subarray has more than one distinct element
            if len(set(l[a-1:b])) > 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good. The corrected code checks if the subarray has more than one distinct element, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the subarray to be good.

**Correctness: False**
