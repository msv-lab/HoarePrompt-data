Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes 't' test cases, where 't' is an integer within the range 1 to 100. For each test case, it reads an integer 'n' and a string 's' of length 'n'. It then returns a list named 'cases' containing 't' tuples. Each tuple includes the last values of 'n' and 's' read from standard input for each test case. After processing all test cases, 't' is reduced to 0.**
