Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 32, and all t strings across all test cases are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a = input()
    l = 0
    h = 0
    for j in a:
        if j == 'A':
            l += 1
        else:
            h += 1
    if l > h:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string, `l` is greater than or equal to the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`, `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`, and `j` is the last character of `a` after the loop has completed. If the number of 'A' characters (`l`) is greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`h`), then `l` remains greater than `h`; otherwise, `l` is at least equal to `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is an empty string or a non-empty string, `j` is the last character of `a`, `l` is the total count of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` is the count of characters in `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is greater than `h`, the function continues under that condition. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is the total count of 'A' characters in the string `a`, and `h` is the count of all other characters in the string `a`. If `l` is greater than `h`, the condition holds as `l` remains the count of 'A' characters and `h` remains the count of other characters. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, the condition also holds as `l` remains the count of 'A' characters and `h` remains the count of other characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
