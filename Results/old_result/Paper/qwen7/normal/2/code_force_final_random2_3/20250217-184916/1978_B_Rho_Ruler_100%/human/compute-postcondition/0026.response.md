Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `profit_mid` is now the value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b); `max_profit` is not updated.**

Explanation: The code updates `profit_next` to the value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
