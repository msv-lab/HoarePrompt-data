Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, and `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be equal to the length of the `total_costs` list.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the original `costs` list. The `rows` list and the `costs` list will remain unchanged. The variable `i` will be equal to the last index it was assigned in the loop, which is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. This means that the loop has processed all possible sums of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list without any remaining elements to process.
