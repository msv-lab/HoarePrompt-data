Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k * k / 2` to the variable `c`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is now determined by the expression `k * k / 2`.
