Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` now includes `v`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are input integers, their values remain unchanged. The other variables (`i` and `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `n` must still be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `nodes[u]` now contains `v`.
