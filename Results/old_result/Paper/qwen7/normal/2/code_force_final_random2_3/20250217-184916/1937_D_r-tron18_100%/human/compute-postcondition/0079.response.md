Output State: **`i` is either `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums with the last element removed, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, and `ans[i]` is updated as follows: If `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]` and `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr).**

Explanation: The line `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
