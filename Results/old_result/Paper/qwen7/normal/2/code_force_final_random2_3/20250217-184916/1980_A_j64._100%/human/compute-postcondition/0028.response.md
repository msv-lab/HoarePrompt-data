Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `m` (an integer between 1 and 5), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It calculates and returns `needed_problems`, which is 7 times the difference between `m` and the minimum count of occurrences of each character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`, if any character count is less than `m`. If all character counts are greater than or equal to `m`, then `needed_problems` is 0.**
