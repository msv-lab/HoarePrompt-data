Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `x` is `(a - (k + 1) * k) // (k + 1) ** 2 + 1`, and `suma` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `i` is `k + 1` from the previous iteration, we substitute `i` with `k + 1` in the formula to get `x`. The other variables (`b`, `i`, and `suma`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code snippet provided.
