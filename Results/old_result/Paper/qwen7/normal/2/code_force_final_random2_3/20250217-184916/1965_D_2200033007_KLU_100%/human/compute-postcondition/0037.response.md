Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = i` to `j < len(a)`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sm` is equal to its previous value plus `a[j]`.
   - `j` remains unchanged.
   - `cts` is a list with the appended value of `sm + a[j]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` remains unchanged, `j` will still be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and checked against `len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `j + 1`.
   - The new value of `sm` will be the previous value of `sm` plus `a[j + 1]`.
   - The new value of `cts` will include the new value of `sm + a[j + 1]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `sm` will be updated to include the next element in the list `a`.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `cts` will be updated to include the new value of `sm + a[j]`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`sm` is equal to its previous value plus `a[j+1]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `cts` is a list with the appended value of `sm + a[j+1]`**
