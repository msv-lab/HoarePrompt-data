Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i == 0`, otherwise updated based on the conditions, `ans` is equal to the initial value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a` in place, changing its order from ascending to descending. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
