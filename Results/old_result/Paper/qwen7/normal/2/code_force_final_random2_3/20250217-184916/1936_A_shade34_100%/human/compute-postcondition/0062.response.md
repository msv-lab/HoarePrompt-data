Output State: **`mak` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `mak`. Since the initial state of `mak` was also `0`, this assignment does not change its value. The variable `pans` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variable `mak2` remains `0` as it was initially and was not modified by the code.
