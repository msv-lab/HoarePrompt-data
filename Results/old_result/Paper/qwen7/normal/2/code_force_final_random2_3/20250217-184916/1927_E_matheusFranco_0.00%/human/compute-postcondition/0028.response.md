Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where the second element is 6 (since `permutation[5] = 6`), `curr_v` is 6, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v` updates the element at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list to `curr_v`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 5 and `curr_v` is 6, the second element of `permutation` (index 1) is updated to 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
