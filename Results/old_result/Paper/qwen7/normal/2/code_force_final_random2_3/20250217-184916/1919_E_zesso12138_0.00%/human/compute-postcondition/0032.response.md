Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is an element of `results` (the next element in the list).

The code snippet is:
```python
print(res)
```

Since `res` is described as "the next element in the list" of `results`, it means `res` is the second element of the `results` list.

Therefore, the output will be the second element of the `results` list.

Output: **the second element of the results list**
