Output State: **`k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variable `k` remains an integer, `sunks` has been incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of because `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`.
