Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **mak**: According to the initial state, `mak` is `len(pans) - 1`. Since `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, the length of `pans` is `n`. Therefore, `mak` is `n - 1`.

2. **i**: The initial state directly states that `i` is `n`.

3. **pans**: `pans` is a list of integers starting from `n-1` down to `0`. For example, if `n` is 5, then `pans` would be `[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.

4. **mak2**: The initial state states that `mak2` is `0`.

5. **n**: `n` is an input integer.

6. **current value of the input string**: The initial state mentions that the current value of the input string is `<`. This detail is not relevant to the print statement but is provided for context.

7. **sys.stdout.flush()**: This function call ensures that any buffered output is written out immediately. It does not affect the content of the print statement.

Given these details, let's execute the print statement:

```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Substituting the values we determined:

- `mak` is `n - 1`.
- `i` is `n`.

So, the print statement becomes:

```python
print('?', n - 1, n - 1, n, n)
```

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? n-1 n-1 n n**
