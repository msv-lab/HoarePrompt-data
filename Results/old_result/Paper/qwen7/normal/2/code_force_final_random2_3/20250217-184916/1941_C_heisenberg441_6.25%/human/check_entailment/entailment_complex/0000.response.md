Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, the function returns 1, which is correct because removing one character ("e") makes the string "mapie" into "mapi", which no longer contains "map" or "pie".

2. **Removing "map" Substrings**: The function then iteratively removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s`. Each time "map" is found, it is removed, and the index of the next occurrence is updated. This process continues until no more "map" substrings are found. The number of removals is counted and added to `ans`.

3. **Removing "pie" Substrings**: Similarly, the function iteratively removes all occurrences of "pie" from the string `s`. Each time "pie" is found, it is removed, and the index of the next occurrence is updated. This process continues until no more "pie" substrings are found. The number of removals is counted and added to `ans`.

4. **Final Return**: The function returns the total count of removals (`ans`), which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string `s` beautiful.

Given the example provided in the annotated program and the explanation, the function correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. The states mentioned in the comments align with the logic of the function.

Therefore, the function correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
