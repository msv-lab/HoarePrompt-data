Output State: **`a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `z`, `n`, `k`, and `adj` remain unchanged from their initial states.
