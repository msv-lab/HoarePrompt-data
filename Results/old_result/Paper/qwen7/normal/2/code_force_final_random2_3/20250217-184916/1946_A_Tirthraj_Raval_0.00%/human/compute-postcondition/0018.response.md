Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[p]`, `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a list element, and assigns this list to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
