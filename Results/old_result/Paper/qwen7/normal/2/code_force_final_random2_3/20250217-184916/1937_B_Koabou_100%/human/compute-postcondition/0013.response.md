Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.**

The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. Since `t`, `a`, `n`, `s`, and `x` are not affected by this assignment, their states remain unchanged.
