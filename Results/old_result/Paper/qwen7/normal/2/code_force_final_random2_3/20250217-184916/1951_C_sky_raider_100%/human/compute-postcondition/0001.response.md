Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of these variables is now set to the values provided by the user as integers.
