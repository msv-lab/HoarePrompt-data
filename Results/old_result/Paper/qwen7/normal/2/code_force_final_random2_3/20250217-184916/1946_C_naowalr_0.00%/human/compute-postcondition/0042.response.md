Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is (L + R) // 2, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. The values of `numCuts` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `numCuts` is still 0, and `x` is still `(L + R) // 2`. The value of `leftover` is the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)`, which is now stored in the variable `leftover`.
