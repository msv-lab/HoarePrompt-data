Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Checkerboard Generation for Specific Values:**
   - For `n = 1`, the program prints a 2x2 checkerboard correctly.
   - For `n = 2`, the program prints a 4x4 checkerboard correctly.
   - For `n = 3`, the program prints a 6x6 checkerboard correctly.
   - For `n = 4`, the program prints an 8x8 checkerboard correctly.
   
3. **Handling Larger Values:**
   - The program includes an `else` block that prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range") when `n` is greater than 4. However, according to the problem statement, the input should always be within the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`. Therefore, this `else` block is unnecessary and incorrect because it does not handle any invalid input as per the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the specific values of `n` up to 4, but it fails to address the general case where `n > 4`. Since the problem specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, the program should either handle all values within this range or explicitly state that it only handles values up to 4. Given that the problem does not specify handling invalid inputs, the program should be corrected to handle all values within the specified range.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case where `n > 4`.

**Correctness: **False**
