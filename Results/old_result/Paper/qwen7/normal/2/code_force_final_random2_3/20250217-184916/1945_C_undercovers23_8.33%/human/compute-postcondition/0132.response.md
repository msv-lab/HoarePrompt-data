Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3, `one` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), `lst` is `[3]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `i + 1` will be either 3 or 4. Therefore, `lst` becomes `[3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
