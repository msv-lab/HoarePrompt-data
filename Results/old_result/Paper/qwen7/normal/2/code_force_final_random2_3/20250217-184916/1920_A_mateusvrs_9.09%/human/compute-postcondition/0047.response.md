Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx`.

3. **Determine the postconditions**:
   - `cx` is a non-empty set.
   - `i` is an element of `cx`.
   - If the current value of `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cx` is a non-empty set.
   - `i` is an element of `cx`.
   - `tmp` has been updated based on the condition (either incremented by 1 or remained unchanged).

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `cx` remains the same unless the loop modifies it, but since no such modification is mentioned, `cx` stays as a non-empty set.
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx` for the next iteration.
   - `tmp` will either remain the same or be incremented by 1 depending on the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element `i` from `cx` and the potential update to `tmp`.

**State:**
- `cx` is a non-empty set.
- `i` is the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` is either the same as the previous value or has been incremented by 1 if the new `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` or `tmp` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

**State:**
- `cx` is a non-empty set.
- `i` is the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration (either unchanged or incremented by 1).

However, to be precise and provide a concrete example, let's assume the following hypothetical values for illustration:

**State:**
- `cx` is a non-empty set.
- `i` is the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration.

For a specific example, if the previous `i` was 5 and `tmp` was 3, and the next `i` is 6 (which is not in the range `[bx, ax]`), then:

**State:**
- `cx` is a non-empty set.
- `i` is 6.
- `tmp` is 3.

But without specific values, the general state would be:

**State:**
- `cx` is a non-empty set.
- `i` is the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration.

Thus, the final answer is:

**State:**
- `cx` is a non-empty set.
- `i` is the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration.
