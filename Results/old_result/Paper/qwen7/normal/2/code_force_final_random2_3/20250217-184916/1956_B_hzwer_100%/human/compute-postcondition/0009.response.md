Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: 
   - `x` is the current element being processed from the list `a`.
   - `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for each element `x` as it is processed.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the last processed element).
   - `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for the last processed element `x`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `x` is the current element being processed, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` will now exclude the current element `x` (since it was already processed).

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `a` will now be the list excluding the last processed element `x`.
- `cnt[x]` will be incremented by 1 for the last processed element `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers excluding the last processed element, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for the last processed element `x`**.
