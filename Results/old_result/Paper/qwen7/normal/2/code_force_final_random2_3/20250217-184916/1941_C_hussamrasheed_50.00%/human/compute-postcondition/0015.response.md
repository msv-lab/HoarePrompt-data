Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is an integer input by the user (its value is unknown but it does not affect the print statement).
- `s` is a string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map' (though this detail is not relevant to the print statement).
- `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`. Since `s` does not contain 'map', it also does not contain 'pie'. Therefore, `p` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(m + p)
```

Since `m` is not defined anywhere in the initial state and is not mentioned in the precondition, we cannot determine its value. However, `p` is 0. Thus, the expression `m + p` simplifies to `m + 0`, which is just `m`.

Output: **m**
