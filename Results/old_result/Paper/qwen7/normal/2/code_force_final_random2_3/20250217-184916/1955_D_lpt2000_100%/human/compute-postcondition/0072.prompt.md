Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `nabors` is a list of strings converted from the input split by spaces, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `bb` is a list of strings converted from another input split by spaces, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing elements in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing elements in `cnt_bb` but not in `D`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains the same; `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next pair of elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`, respectively, and `m` and `n` remain the same; `pairs_in_D`, `C[in_aa]`, and `D[in_aa]` might be updated if `C[in_aa] > 0`; `pairs_in_D` might be updated if `D[out_aa] > 0`; `E[out_aa]` might be increased by 1 if `D[out_aa] <= 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is either increased by 1 or decreased by 1 depending on the condition, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
