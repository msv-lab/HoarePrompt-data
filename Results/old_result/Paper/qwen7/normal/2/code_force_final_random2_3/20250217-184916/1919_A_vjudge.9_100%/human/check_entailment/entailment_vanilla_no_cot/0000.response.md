Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. The logic in the `if` statement checks whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, which does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for the game.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the initial number of coins in each player's wallet. The key observation is that if the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, Alice will always win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because:

- If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice can always force the game into a state where the sum becomes even after her turn, ensuring she can always make a move when it's her turn again.
- If the sum of the coins is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves to ensure the sum remains even, forcing Alice into a losing position eventually.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This version correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
