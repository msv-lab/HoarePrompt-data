Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an empty list, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    cases.append((n, s))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is a string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(t, <initial value of s>)` and the second tuple is `(n, s)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is an integer input from stdin; `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `cases` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is `(t-1, s)`, the second tuple is `(n, s)`, and the third tuple is `(n, s)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
