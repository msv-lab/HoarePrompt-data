Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is a string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from standard input and converts it to an integer, storing it in the variable `n`. It also reads a string `s` from standard input, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and stores it in the variable `s`. The variable `cases` remains unchanged as it was already initialized with a tuple containing `(n, s)`. The variable `t` is still greater than 0 as no operation has changed its value.
