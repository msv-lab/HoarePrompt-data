Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Understand the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the Values for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.
   - `i` should be updated to 2.
   - `n` must remain at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
