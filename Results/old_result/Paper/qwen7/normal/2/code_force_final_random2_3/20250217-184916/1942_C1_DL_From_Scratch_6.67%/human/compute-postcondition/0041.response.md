Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. Since `i` was initially `x - 1`, the new value of `num` is calculated based on the updated index `i + 1`. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged, and the new value of `num` is determined by the list values at indices `i` and `i + 1`.
