Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and possibly 'no', `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', then `results` will only contain 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` will contain both 'yes' and 'no'.
