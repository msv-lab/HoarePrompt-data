Output State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the return value of `func_2()` and these two values replace the previous values of `n` and `k`.**

This means that the function `func_2()` was called, and it returned two values which were assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. All other variables retain their previous states.
