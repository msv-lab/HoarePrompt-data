Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is [a[0] - T[0], a[0] - T[0] - T[1]]**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`, and `T[i - 1]` is `T[1]`. Since `a[0] - T[0]` was the initial value of `a[0]`, the new element added to `a` is `a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`. Therefore, `a` becomes `[a[0] - T[0], a[0] - T[0] - T[1]]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
