Output State: **`i` is `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is `ol`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to itself.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `ol` and `zr` to be `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
