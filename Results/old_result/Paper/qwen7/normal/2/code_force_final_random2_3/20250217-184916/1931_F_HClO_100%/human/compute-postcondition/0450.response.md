Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`), and the third tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` adds a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`). After appending another tuple `(a3, l3)`, `val` now contains three such tuples. All other variables remain unchanged.
