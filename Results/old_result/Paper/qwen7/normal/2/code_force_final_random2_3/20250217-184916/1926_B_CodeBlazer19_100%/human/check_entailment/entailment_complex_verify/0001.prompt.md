You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of t test cases, each test case starts with an integer n followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, with the size of the triangle or square being greater than 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 100 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n followed by an n x n grid of '0's and '1's. The function determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. If a triangle is found, it prints 'TRIANGLE'; if a square is found, it prints 'SQUARE'. If neither shape is found, it prints an appropriate message indicating no valid shape was identified.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining whether a given binary grid represents a triangle or a square. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square formed by '1's.
   
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.
   - It initializes two variables `a` and `b` to store potential shapes ("TRIANGLE" or "SQUARE").
   - For each row in the grid, it checks if there is exactly one '1' (indicating a potential triangle).
   - If a row has more than one '1', it sets `b` to "SQUARE".
   - After processing all rows, it prints the value of `a` if it's not zero, otherwise it prints `b`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic for identifying a triangle is flawed. A triangle is defined by having `2*i-1` consecutive '1's in the middle of the row, not just one '1'.
   - The program does not correctly identify the structure of the triangle or square. It only checks if any row has exactly one '1' or more than one '1', which is insufficient for determining the shape.
   - The program does not handle the specific patterns required for a triangle or square as described in the problem statement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to identify whether the grid represents a triangle or a square based on the problem description.
