Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` is True, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index `i` to the end, and in both cases (whether the if condition is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
