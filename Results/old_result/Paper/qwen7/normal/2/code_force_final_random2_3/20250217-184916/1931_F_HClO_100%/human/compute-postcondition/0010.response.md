Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, and `m` is 1; `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input split by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first part to `a2` and the rest to `l2` as a list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`) remain unchanged.
