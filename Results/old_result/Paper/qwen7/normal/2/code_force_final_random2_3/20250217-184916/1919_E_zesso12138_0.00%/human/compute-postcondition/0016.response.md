Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 2`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `p` by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers using the `map` function and `int`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is taken from `data[index]`, and `p` is updated accordingly.
