Postcondition: `tree` deque contains `n` elements, `empty` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(n, idx), min(n, n - idx - 1)]`. If at least one move in `moves` is odd, the postcondition remains as described in the if part. If all moves in the `moves` list are even numbers, the postcondition remains as described in the else part.
