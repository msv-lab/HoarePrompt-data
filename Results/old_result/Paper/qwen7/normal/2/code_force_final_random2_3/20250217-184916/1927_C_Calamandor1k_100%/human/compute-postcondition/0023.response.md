Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES'; no changes to `k`**.

The code appends `'YES'` to the `results` list. The value of `total_distinct` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the value of `k` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `'YES'` to the `results` list.
