You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` remaining an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` being the original input integer greater than 0, and `i` being the last iteration index (n-1). For each iteration `i` from 0 to n-1, there is a corresponding input string `s_i`, a set `a_i` containing unique characters from `s_i`, and two strings `b_i` and `c_i` where `b_i` is the sorted version of `s_i` and `c_i` is the sorted version of `s_i` in descending order. If the size of `a_i` is 1, then `c_i` remains unchanged; otherwise, `c_i` is the sorted version of `s_i` in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the input string `s` contains more than one unique character. If `s` consists of a single unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then outputs either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or the lexicographically largest permutation of `s`, depending on which permutation matches the original string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Single Character Set:**
   - It creates a set `a` from the string `s`.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, it prints 'NO' because no rearrangement can produce a different string.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Generating Rearrangements:**
   - It generates two rearrangements of the string `s`:
     - `b` is the sorted version of `s` (in ascending order).
     - `c` is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.
   - If the original string `s` is already sorted in ascending order (`b == s`), it prints the descending order string `c`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the ascending order string `b`.

### Testing the Program with Provided Examples:

1. **Test Case: "codeforces"**
   - Set `a` has more than one character, so it prints 'YES'.
   - Sorted in ascending order: `b = 'ccdefoorrst'`, which is different from the original.
   - Print: `ccdefoorrst` (valid).

2. **Test Case: "aaaaa"**
   - Set `a` has only one character, so it prints 'NO'.
   - No valid rearrangement exists.

3. **Test Case: "xxxxy"**
   - Set `a` has more than one character, so it prints 'YES'.
   - Sorted in ascending order: `b = 'xxxxy'`, which is different from the original.
   - Print: `xxxxy` (valid).

4. **Test Case: "co"**
   - Set `a` has more than one character, so it prints 'YES'.
   - Sorted in ascending order: `b = 'co'`, which is the same as the original.
   - Sorted in descending order: `c = 'oc'`, which is different from the original.
   - Print: `oc` (valid).

5. **Test Case: "d"**
   - Set `a` has only one character, so it prints 'NO'.
   - No valid rearrangement exists.

6. **Test Case: "nutdealer"**
   - Set `a` has more than one character, so it prints 'YES'.
   - Sorted in ascending order: `b = 'aeldeennrtu'`, which is different from the original.
   - Print: `aeldeennrtu` (valid).

7. **Test Case: "mwistht"**
   - Set `a` has more than one character, so it prints 'YES'.
   - Sorted in ascending order: `b = 'hmmiiittw'`, which is different from the original.
   - Print: `hmmiiittw` (valid).

8. **Test Case: "hhhhhhhhhh"**
   - Set `a` has only one character, so it prints 'NO'.
   - No valid rearrangement exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all test cases as per the problem description. It checks if a string can be rearranged into a different string and prints the appropriate result.
