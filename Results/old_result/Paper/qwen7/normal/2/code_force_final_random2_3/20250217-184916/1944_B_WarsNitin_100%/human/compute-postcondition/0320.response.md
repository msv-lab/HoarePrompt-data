Output State: **`k` is equal to 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[2]`. The values of `k`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
