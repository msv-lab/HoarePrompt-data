Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `max` is the minimum value between `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in `a`. The values of `i`, `max`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
