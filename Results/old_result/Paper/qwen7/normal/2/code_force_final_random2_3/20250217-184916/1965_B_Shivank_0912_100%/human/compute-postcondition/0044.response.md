Output State: **`j` is an integer, `i` is an integer, and the value of `j` is not equal to the value of `i`; `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << j`.**

Explanation: The code appends `1 << j` (which is a bitwise left shift operation) to the list `ans`. Since `j` is an integer, `1 << j` results in a power of 2 where the exponent is `j`. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `j` is not equal to `i` still holds. The variable `ans` is now a list containing one element, which is `1 << j`.
