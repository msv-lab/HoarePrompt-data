Based on the initial state provided, the `results` list contains 6 elements, and the 6th element is either `'YES'` or `'NO'`. The code snippet simply prints the 6th element of the `results` list.

Since the exact value of the 6th element is not specified, it could be either `'YES'` or `'NO'`.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where the value depends on the 6th element of the results list)**
