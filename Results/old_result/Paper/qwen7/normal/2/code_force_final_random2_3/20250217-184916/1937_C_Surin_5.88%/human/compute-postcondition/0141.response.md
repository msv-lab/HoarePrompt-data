Output State: `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, and `v2` is `n-1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`. Since `v1` and `v2` are both assigned the value of `i` in each iteration and `v1` retains its last value if the input is '<', the final values of `v1` and `v2` will be `n-1`. The variable `g` remains 0 as it was not affected by any operations within the loop.
