### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the implementation.

#### Problem Revisited

The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The cost to move from position `j` to position `i` (where `j < i`) involves paying `a_j` coins to the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and `i`.

#### Function Summaries

- `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` processes the input for a single test case and computes the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
   lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
   lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   - Correctly reads `n` and `k`.
   - Reads the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` representing `a_i` and `b_i`.

2. **Reversing Lists:**
   ```python
   lista_A.reverse()
   lista_B.reverse()
   ```
   - Reversing the lists is unnecessary and incorrect. The original order of the lists should be maintained.

3. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   soma_b = 0
   pref = 0
   ```
   - Initializes `soma_b` and `pref`.

4. **First Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - k):
       if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
           pref += soma_b
           pref += lista_A[i]
           soma_b = 0
       else:
           soma_b += lista_B[i]
   ```
   - This loop attempts to calculate the cost to move from position `i` to the desired positions. However, it incorrectly handles the cumulative cost calculation.

5. **Second Loop:**
   ```python
   resultado = float('inf')
   for i in range(n - k, n):
       resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
       soma_b += lista_B[i]
   ```
   - This loop calculates the minimum cost to move to the first `m` positions. However, the logic is still flawed due to the incorrect handling of cumulative costs.

#### Correct Implementation

The correct approach involves maintaining a running sum of `b_i` values and using a priority queue or a similar structure to keep track of the minimum cost to move to each position. The given implementation does not correctly handle this.

### Conclusion

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
