Output State: **`palka` must not be empty, `i` is increased by 1 in dictionary `d`, and `d[i]` is now 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the first element of `palka` in the initial state, after executing the code, `d[i]` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
