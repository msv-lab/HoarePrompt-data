Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, and `arr` is the string input by the user. If `n` is even, `results` contains 'no'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'yes' or 'no' based on the count comparison of 'U' and 'D' in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and possibly 'no', `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string. If `n` is even, `results` will contain both 'yes' and 'no'. Otherwise, if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', then `results` will only contain 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` will contain both 'yes' and 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no', `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, and 'no' is appended to the `results` list if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, either 'yes' or 'no' is appended to the `results` list based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
