Output State: `res` is a list containing all elements of `results`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `res` will hold a list containing all the return values of `func_1(n, p)` from each iteration. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `results` and prints it, but the final state of `res` will be the entire list of these return values from all iterations.
