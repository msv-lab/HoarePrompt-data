Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is either an empty string or 'TRIANGLE'.
- `b` is either an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE'.
- `n` is the total number of inputs provided by the user.
- `j` is 0.
- `s` is the last input string provided by the user.

No specific value is given for `b`, but it is explicitly stated that `b` can be an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE'. Since no additional constraints or conditions are provided that would change the value of `b`, `b` retains its possible values as described.

The `print(b)` statement will output the current value of `b`.

Output: **b (where b can be an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE')**
