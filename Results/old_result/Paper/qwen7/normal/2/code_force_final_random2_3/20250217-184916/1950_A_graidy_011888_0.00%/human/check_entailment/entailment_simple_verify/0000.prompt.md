You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code: 
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 1001, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.
    #
    #After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i` = 1 to `i` = 1000), the value of `i` will be 1001 because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 at the end of each iteration. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be random integers generated within each iteration of the loop, and `res` will be determined based on the conditions specified in the loop body, resulting in either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program generates random test cases and determines whether they form a stair, peak, or none. However, the logic inside the `func` function is incorrect. Specifically, the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair or a peak is flawed. Here's why:

- The program checks if `x < y` and then proceeds to check the relationship between `y` and `z`. However, it does not correctly handle the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`).
- The logic inside the conditional statements is incorrect. For example, if `x < y`, it should check if `y > z` to determine a peak, but instead, it directly assigns `res` to either 'peak' or 'none' without checking both conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print(a, b, c, sep=' ')
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print(a, b, c, sep=' ')
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print(a, b, c, sep=' ')
            print('NONE')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case, correctly determining whether the digits form a stair, peak, or none based on the given conditions.
