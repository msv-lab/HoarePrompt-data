Output State: `i` will be `w + 1`, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer, and `M` will contain all integers from 1 up to `w` inclusive.

To explain this output state in natural language:

After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have incremented to `w + 1`, where `w` is the integer square root of `q`. This means the loop has iterated through all integers from 1 to `w`. The variable `q` must remain a perfect square greater than 1, as it was initially. The list `M` will contain all integers from 1 up to `w` inclusive because for each `i` from 1 to `w`, if `i` satisfies the conditions within the loop, it gets added to `M`. Given that `q` is a perfect square, every integer from 1 to `w` will satisfy the conditions to be added to `M` at some point during the loop's execution.
