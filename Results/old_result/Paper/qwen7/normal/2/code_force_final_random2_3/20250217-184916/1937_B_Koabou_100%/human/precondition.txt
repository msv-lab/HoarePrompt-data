t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. Additionally, there are two binary strings of length n, representing the values of a_{1j} and a_{2j} for 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
