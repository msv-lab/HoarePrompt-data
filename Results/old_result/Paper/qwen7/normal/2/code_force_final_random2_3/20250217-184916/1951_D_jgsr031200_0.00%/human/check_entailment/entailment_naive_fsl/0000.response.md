Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to set up stalls and prices in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, but it fails to handle all potential cases correctly.

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  10 15
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

However, the program outputs:
```
YES
2
10 5
```

This output is incorrect because Alice would only be able to buy 10 jewels in total (5 from the first stall and 5 from the second stall), which is less than the required 15 jewels. Therefore, the program incorrectly suggests that it is possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 15 jewels, which is not true.

The program needs to ensure that the sum of the quantities of jewels Alice can buy from the stalls equals exactly `k`. The current implementation does not guarantee this, as shown in the counterexample.
