Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - k`, `pref` will be the sum of all `lista_A[i]` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, plus the cumulative sum of `lista_B[i]` where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]`, and `soma_b` will be 0.

In more detail:
- The variable `i` will have the value `n - k` after the loop completes because the loop runs from `0` to `n - k - 1`.
- `pref` will accumulate the values of `lista_A[i]` when `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, plus any previously accumulated values from `soma_b` when `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`.
- `soma_b` will be reset to 0 at the end of each iteration if `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, and it will only hold the cumulative sum of `lista_B[i]` values when `lista_A[i]` is greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]`. However, since `soma_b` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, it will always be 0 at the end of the loop.
