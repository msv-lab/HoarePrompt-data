### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Initial State**: `row` is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells in a single row, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
- **First Loop**: This loop increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1.
- **Second Loop**: This loop updates the remaining elements of `row` based on the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus 1. If `i` is 0, it initializes the first element with 0.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of `func_1`:
1. Increment the first `d-1` elements by 1.
2. For each element from `d-1` to the end of the list, update the element to be the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus 1.

This function aims to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the logic in the second loop is flawed because it only considers the minimum of the previous `d` elements, which does not guarantee that the distance constraint is met for all pairs of adjacent supports.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Input Parsing**: Reads the dimensions and the grid of river depths.
- **Cost Calculation**: Calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of placing supports in that row.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: Computes the minimum total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finding the minimum sum.

The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which does not correctly enforce the distance constraint between supports. The annotated code confirms that `func_1` only ensures that the first `d-1` elements are incremented and the rest are updated based on the minimum of the previous `d` elements, which is insufficient to meet the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not properly handle the logic required to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
