### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Setup**: The function `func_1()` correctly extracts the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips. This part is also correct.

3. **Immediate Draw Condition**: The program checks if Bob's chip is initially in a lower row than Alice's. If so, it immediately prints "Draw". This condition is handled correctly.

4. **Odd Difference Check**: The program checks if the difference in rows between Bob's and Alice's chips is odd. If it is, it proceeds to check further conditions for Alice's win. This logic is correct.

5. **Even Difference Check**: If the difference in rows is even, the program checks for Bob's win. This logic is also correct.

6. **Movement Logic**:
   - **Alice's Moves**: The program attempts to simulate Alice's moves and checks if she can force a win. However, there are significant issues with how the movements are simulated and checked:
     - The program incorrectly updates the positions of Alice and Bob's chips without properly considering all possible moves.
     - The logic for checking if Alice can force a win is flawed. It does not correctly simulate all possible moves and outcomes.
   - **Bob's Moves**: Similarly, the logic for Bob's moves and win conditions is also flawed and does not correctly simulate the game.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board, or when the positions are very close to each other.

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment is accurate. The program indeed fails to correctly simulate the game and does not handle all possible scenarios and edge cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner based on the movements and positions of the chips is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the game and does not handle all possible scenarios and edge cases.
