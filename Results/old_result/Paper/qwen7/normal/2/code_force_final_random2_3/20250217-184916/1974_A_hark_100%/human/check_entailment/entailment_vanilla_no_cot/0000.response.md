Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct for determining how many full 2x2 icons can fit.
   - However, the logic for adjusting `x` after placing 2x2 icons is flawed. Specifically, the expression `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it assumes each 2x2 icon takes up 15 cells, which is not true. A 2x2 icon actually takes up 4 cells, and the remaining cells should be calculated accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Cells:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells (`x`) need to be handled correctly. The current logic `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect and should instead calculate the remaining cells that can fit 1x1 icons.

3. **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining Screens:**
   - The calculation for the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`) is also incorrect. It should be based on the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for _ in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells = 5 * 3  # Total cells per screen
        screens_needed = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons
        bxsfory = min(y, total_cells // 4)
        y -= bxsfory
        x -= bxsfory * 4
        
        # Place 1x1 icons
        bxsfory1 = math.ceil((x + y) / (total_cells - 4 * bxsfory))
        
        screens_needed += bxsfory + bxsfory1
        
        print(screens_needed)

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the number of screens needed to place all icons.
