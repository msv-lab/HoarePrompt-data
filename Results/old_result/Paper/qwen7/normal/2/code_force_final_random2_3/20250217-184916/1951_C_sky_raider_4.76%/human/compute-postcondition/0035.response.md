Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must be true.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `c` is `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` must remain such that `i < n` holds true. Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 (since it was greater than 0 initially and needs to accommodate the new value of `i`).

6. **Other variables (`c`, `l`, `s`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again**.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
