Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, and either zero percentage is greater than or equal to 50 and one percentage is greater than or equal to 50, or there is no change in the variables as there is no else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `one_perc` is 0, `zero_perc` is 50; `lst` is [3]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 5, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` is `[5]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, `i` remains 4, and `lst` remains empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
