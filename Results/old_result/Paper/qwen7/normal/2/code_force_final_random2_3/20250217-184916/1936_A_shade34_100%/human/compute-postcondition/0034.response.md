Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string that is not equal to '<', and `pans` is a list that now contains the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to the list `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains `n-1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `s` remains a string not equal to '<', and `pans` is updated to include the value of `i`.
