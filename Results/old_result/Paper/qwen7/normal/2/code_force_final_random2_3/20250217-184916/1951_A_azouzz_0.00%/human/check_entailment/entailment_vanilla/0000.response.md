Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem description is not explicitly provided in the given snippet. However, based on the code, it appears that the task involves processing a directory structure and generating specific files for certain `.html` files within specified subfolders.

2. **Code Structure**:
   - The code is split into two parts:
     - A function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that processes directories and generates files.
     - A main block that calls `generate_files_for_html_in_range` with specific parameters.

3. **Function `generate_files_for_html_in_range`**:
   - This function iterates over all subdirectories in the current working directory.
   - It checks if the subdirectory name is a digit and falls within the specified range (`start` to `end`).
   - For each matching subdirectory, it lists all `.html` files and prints the count.
   - It then generates two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found.

4. **Main Block**:
   - The main block calls `generate_files_for_html_in_range` with `start_range = 1951` and `end_range = 1980`.

5. **Second Provided Function `func_1`**:
   - This function does not seem to be related to the first part of the code.
   - It reads input values from the user, counts occurrences of '1' in a string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions.
   - This function is not called anywhere in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The second function `func_1` is not used in the provided code and does not affect the functionality of the first part of the code. The first part of the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
