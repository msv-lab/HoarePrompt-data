Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` creates a new list `c` that contains the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
