Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty, `i` is the first character of `s` which is no longer in the `alphabet`, and `alphabet` does not contain `i`.**

Explanation: The code removes the character `i` from the `alphabet`. Since `i` was the first character of the string `s` and is now removed from `alphabet`, the value of `i` itself changes to reflect that it is no longer part of `alphabet`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
