Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l` appended with the element at index 1 of `l`; `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l` appended.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. However, since `k` was not directly referenced in the initial state, its change does not affect `ans1` or `ans2`. The values of `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain as described in the initial state, with `i` being updated to 0.
