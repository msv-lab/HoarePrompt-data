Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the new input string provided, `b` is 'SQUARE'**.

The code simply reassigns the value of `b` to 'SQUARE', which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged, and `b` is updated to 'SQUARE'.
