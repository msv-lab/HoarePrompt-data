Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the same as before, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and `ans` is a list containing `[sums]` if the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is 2, and the value of `k` remains unchanged. The variable `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The condition `i + x - 1 < n` determines whether `sums` is appended to the list `ans` as its only element or not. Since the exact value of `x` and `n` is not given, we express the updated `sums` and the potential change in `ans` based on the condition.
