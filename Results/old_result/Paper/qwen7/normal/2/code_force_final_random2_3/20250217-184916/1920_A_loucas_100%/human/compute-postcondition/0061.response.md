Output State: All elements from `no` have been iterated over, and the variable `num` has been decremented for each iteration until it becomes less than 1. At this point, the loop stops. The final value of `num` is the result of subtracting the length of `no` from the initial value of `num`. If `no` is empty, `num` remains its initial value. `big` contains all integers `a` for which `x` was 1 during the iterations, `less` contains all integers `a` for which `x` was 2, and `no` is empty since all its elements have been processed.
