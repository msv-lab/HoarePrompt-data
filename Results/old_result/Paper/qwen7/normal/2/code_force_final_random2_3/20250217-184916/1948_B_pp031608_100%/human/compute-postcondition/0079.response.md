Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 0.
   - `m` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m - 1`. Specifically, the loop will run from `m-1` down to 1 (since the upper bound is exclusive).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to 0, it will enter the loop if `m - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. This means `m` must be at least 1.
   - The value of `i` will change within the loop, but the initial state of `i` being 0 is correct for the loop to start.

5. **Final state required for the loop to execute**:
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to start.
   - `i` is already set to 0, which is the starting point for the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
