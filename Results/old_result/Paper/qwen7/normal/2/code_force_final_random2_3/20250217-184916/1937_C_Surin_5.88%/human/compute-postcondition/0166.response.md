Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, and `r` is an input string that was never equal to '>' during the loop execution.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i=1` to `i=n-1`. Given that the loop executes up to 3 times as per the provided states, it implies that `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to run its full course. During each iteration, `prev` is updated to the current value of `i`. Since `r` was never equal to '>', `prev` retains the value of `i` from the last iteration, which is `n-1`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, and `prev` will also be `n-1`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain `n-1` as they are not modified within the loop.
