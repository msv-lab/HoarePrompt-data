Output State: `left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 1, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `left` will be equal to the length of `s` (which is 5 based on the information given), because the loop increments `left` until it reaches the end of the string or encounters a '1'. Since the loop stops when `left` equals the length of `s` and there are no '0's from index `right` onwards, the final value of `cost` will be `right - left + 1`, which is `5 - 5 + 1 = 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration.
