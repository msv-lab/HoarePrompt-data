Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with the next `val`, and `val` is the next element from `a`; `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val` and then XORed with `op` right-shifted by `i` and ANDed with 1; `t` is a list containing one additional element which is the updated `ai`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the current value of `ai` to the list `t`. This does not affect the values of `a` or `ai` directly, but it does add a new element to the list `t`. Therefore, the list `t` now contains one more element, which is the current value of `ai`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
