Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `oneInd` by calculating `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Since the values of `preOne` and the function `func_1` are not specified, `oneInd` is updated based on these values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
