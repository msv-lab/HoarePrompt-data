Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`.
- The length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`.
- The current state of `l3` is such that it does not contain all elements of `l` that are not equal to `a3`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('no')` will simply output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
