Postcondition: **`sortedPassword` is a string composed of the concatenation of `digits` and `letters`, sorted in ascending order; for every `i` in the range of `len(digits)`, the following conditions hold: - `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`. - For all `i` where `i` is less than `len(letters)`, `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`. Additionally, `sortedPassword` is not equal to `password`.**
