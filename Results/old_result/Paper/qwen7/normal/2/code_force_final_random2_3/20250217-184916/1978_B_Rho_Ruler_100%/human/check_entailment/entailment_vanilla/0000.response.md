Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \):

\[ \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

- \( k \times b \): The total revenue from the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price.
- \( -\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \): This term adjusts the revenue to account for the decreasing price of each bun.
- \( (n - k) \times a \): The total revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price \( a \).

#### Function `func_2`
This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `low` is set to 0.
   - `high` is set to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - Calculate the middle point `mid`.
   - Compute the profit for \( k = mid \) using `func_1`.
   - Compute the profit for \( k = mid + 1 \) using `func_1`.
   - Update `max_profit` with the maximum of the current `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - Adjust `low` and `high` based on whether the profit of \( k = mid + 1 \) is greater than `profit_mid`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The formula in `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for any given \( k \).
   - The binary search in `func_2` ensures that we explore all possible values of \( k \) efficiently.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is correctly implemented to find the maximum profit.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that all possible \( k \) values are considered.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k = 0 \), the profit is simply \( n \times a \), which is handled correctly.
   - When \( k = n \), the profit is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (b - i + 1) \), which is also handled correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by selling all buns under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
