Output State: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, and for each tuple, `l3` is exactly the list of all elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `t` is 0; we continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop or statement it is part of. Therefore, the values of `val`, `n`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or statement.
