Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are in the range 1 to n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; input method is changed to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply changes the input method to `sys.stdin.readline` without affecting the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the input method used.
