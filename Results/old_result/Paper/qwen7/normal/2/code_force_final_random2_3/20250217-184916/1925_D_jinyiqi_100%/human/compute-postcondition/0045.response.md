Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, `f`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, and `t` are not yet defined.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of `cn2`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. The values of `m` and `k` are now known integers, but `a`, `b`, `f`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, and `t` are not yet defined as they depend on future inputs or calculations.
