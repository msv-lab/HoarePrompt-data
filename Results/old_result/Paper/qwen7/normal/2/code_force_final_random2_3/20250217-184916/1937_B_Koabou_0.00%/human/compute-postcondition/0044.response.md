Postcondition: `a` is a list of strings, `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `x - (i + 1) + 1`, and `x` is the same as before. If the first `i + 1` characters of the first string in list `a` match the first `i + 1` characters of string `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If they do not match, the postcondition remains unchanged.
