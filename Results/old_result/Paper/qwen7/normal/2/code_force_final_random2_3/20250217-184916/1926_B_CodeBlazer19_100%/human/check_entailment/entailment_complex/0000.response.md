Reasoning:
The provided function `func()` attempts to determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square made up of '1's. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the function:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Triangle Detection**: The function checks if any row contains exactly one '1' and sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. This is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1', as long as they are aligned vertically. Similarly, setting `b` to 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1' is also incorrect because a square can have multiple rows with more than one '1' but aligned horizontally.

2. **Overwriting Variables**: The variables `a` and `b` are overwritten in each iteration of the outer loop, which means only the results from the last test case will be printed. This is not the intended behavior since the function should process all test cases independently.

3. **Incomplete Logic**: The function does not correctly identify the shape (triangle or square) for each test case. It only checks if any row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', which is insufficient to determine the shape.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
