Postcondition: **`u` is 0, `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a tuple with at least `n + 3` elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]` extended for each iteration, `v` is `y - x`, `c` and `d` are updated to the values returned by `r()`**.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `c < d` is true or false, the values of `u`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states as specified in the precondition. Specifically, `u` remains 0, `t` is adjusted by subtracting `2 * n`, `a` retains its tuple structure with at least `n + 3` elements, `b` follows its defined extension pattern, `v` is the difference between `y` and `x`, and `c` and `d` are updated according to the function `r()`.
