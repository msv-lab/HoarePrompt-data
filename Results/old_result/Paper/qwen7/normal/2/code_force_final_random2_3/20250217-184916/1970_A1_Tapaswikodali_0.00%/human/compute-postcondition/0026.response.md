Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `balance` is either a positive or negative integer depending on whether there are more opening or closing parentheses in `s`, and `details` is a list containing as many tuples as there are characters in `s`. Each tuple in `details` has the form `(balance, -i, char)`, and the list `details` is sorted based on the balance value.**

Explanation: The code `details.sort()` sorts the `details` list based on the `balance` value in each tuple. The sorting does not change the values of `s`, `i`, or `balance`, but it changes the order of the elements in the `details` list. Therefore, the `details` list now contains tuples sorted by their `balance` values.
