Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the code execution. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
