Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to determine the bets. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bet amount will be strictly less than the total winnings for any winning outcome.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
3
5 5 5
```
- Expected Output:
```
-1
```
- Actual Output:
```
125 125 125 
```

In this case, the program calculates `prod` as `5 * 5 * 5 = 125`. It then sets each bet to `125 // 5 = 25`, resulting in bets of `25, 25, 25`. The total bet amount is `25 + 25 + 25 = 75`, but the winnings for any winning outcome would be `5 * 25 = 125`, which is not strictly greater than `75`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
