### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - The program correctly calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).

3. **Distributing Bets:**
   - The program distributes the bets such that the total bet for each outcome is `prod // a[i]`.
   - This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the player will receive `k_i * (prod // a[i])` coins, which is strictly greater than the total bet `prod`.

4. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to `prod`.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the distribution of bets.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the sum of bets could be equal to `prod` but still satisfy the condition (i.e., the sum should be strictly less than `prod`).

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided again:

#### Test Case 1:
- `bets = 3`
- `a = [3, 2, 7]`
- `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- Distributing bets: `a[0] = 42 // 3 = 14`, `a[1] = 42 // 2 = 21`, `a[2] = 42 // 7 = 6`
- Sum of bets: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
- Since `41 < 42`, the program prints `14 21 6`

#### Test Case 2:
- `bets = 2`
- `a = [3, 3]`
- `prod = 3 * 3 = 9`
- Distributing bets: `a[0] = 9 // 3 = 3`, `a[1] = 9 // 3 = 3`
- Sum of bets: `3 + 3 = 6`
- Since `6 < 9`, the program prints `3 3`

#### Test Case 3:
- `bets = 5`
- `a = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
- `prod = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125`
- Distributing bets: `a[0] = 3125 // 5 = 625`, `a[1] = 3125 // 5 = 625`, `a[2] = 3125 // 5 = 625`, `a[3] = 3125 // 5 = 625`, `a[4] = 3125 // 5 = 625`
- Sum of bets: `625 + 625 + 625 + 625 + 625 = 3125`
- Since `3125 == 3125`, the program prints `-1`

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program fails to handle the case where the sum of bets is equal to `prod` but should be strictly less than `prod`. However, the program already ensures that the sum of bets is strictly less than `prod` by distributing the bets as `prod // a[i]`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
