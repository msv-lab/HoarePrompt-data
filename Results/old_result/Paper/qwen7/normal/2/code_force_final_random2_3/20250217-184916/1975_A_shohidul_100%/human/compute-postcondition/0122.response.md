Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and in both cases (whether the if condition is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
