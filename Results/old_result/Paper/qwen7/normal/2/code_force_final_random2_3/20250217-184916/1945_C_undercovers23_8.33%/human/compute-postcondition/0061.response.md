Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `elem` and the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `elem` and `lst`**:
   - `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
   - `final` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`, assigning the current element to `elem` during each iteration.
   - The initial state of `elem` will be the first element of `lst` when the loop starts its first iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `mini` is already determined based on the values in `lst`, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `final` remains an empty list throughout the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted either.
   - `elem` should be set to the first element of `lst` for the loop to start its first iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `elem` should be set to the first element of `lst`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element of `lst`**
